# Love in the Time of Craigslist
## A Tale of Five Cities
In an ever-increasingly digital world, how has the human quest for love changed? In our project Craigslove, we try to answer this question, and more.

##How to use 
run 'python craigslove.py <url>'

the url should be a base url in this form:
newyork.craigslist.org
sfbay.craigslist.org
providence.craigslist.org
miami.craigslist.org
denver.craigslist.org
dallas.craigslist.org

This will scrape personals from Strictly Platonic (stp), Miscellaneous Romance (msr), w4w, w4m, m4w, and m4m.

Output is saved in 'results/<city>/<query>.csv' (for example: 'results/providence/w4w.csv')

##Setup (mac instructions)
install Python 2.7 and pip
'sudo pip install BeautifulSoup4'
'brew install libxml2'
'pip install lxml' (if that doesnâ€™t work try this first: 'xcode-select --install')
