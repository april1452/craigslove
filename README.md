## k-means clustering
##### ml/clustering/cluster.py
*instructions for running within the ml/clustering directory:*  
  
__`python cluster.py -path data/city/sample -c 2 -plot True`__  
  
This will perform 2-means clustering on each csv file in __`data/city/sample`__.  
The resulting clusters in json format are saved to __`cluster_data/`__.  
It will also create 2-dimensional scatter plots representing the clusters, saved to __`cluster_plot/`__.  
  
note: __`ml/clustering/data/`__ is populated from the original raw __`posts/`__ by running __`ml/clustering/util/format_posts_for_clustering.py`__.
