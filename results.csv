To keep a long story relatively short I got my morning shift called off so I am free and looking for a smoke buddy to come over and get smoked out no strings just two people getting to know each other. I am open to it being more than platonic but I am mainly just seeking some smoke company right now.I am pretty good looking and aged on the fit scale. My roommate's will be back at some point after 1 I can meet after that but the probability I can host will be less my roommates aren't too fond of 420. Anyways if your interested no pic needed just send me your stats and I will respond with my address, I honestly am pretty high already so looking to make this as simple as humanly possible haha.

seeking a unique and once in a lifetime opportunity. I'm visiting Cali for the first time and would love to meet someone to hang with for the week and the bonus is I want to treat someone to a nice Valentines Day too, its been a while. I'm sick of crappy hotels, I want to spend a week with you, enjoy cool places you enjoy, feel like a fun couple trying to find love in our hearts. I'm clean, dd free, smoker or non it doesn't matter, I'm seeking a kind heart not sex. I let those emotions happen naturally. I do have daytime plans on 2 days otherwise I want to spend time with you and spread my joy into your life. Maybe your getting lonely or just love meeting new and exciting people. I want to make a friend for life and who knows, maybe you will win over my heart and make me your prince. Options for relocation are not out of the question either. All I ask is a simple face pic to show me your real and serious and tell me your favorite color that you will wear for our Valentines Day to remember for years to come. I will reply in kind with my digits so we can take it further. Show me what Cali is like, show me your kind caring sweet personality and I'll treat you like a queen. I'm not picky on age or looks, just melt my heart with a sweet smile. I'm single, no drama, and please don't offer services or have me email endless addresses or texting all over the place. This isn't my first rodeo, just want someone to take a chance in life as if you don't you will never experience what life has to offer. I will check my emails Monday Night/Tuesday morning to pick a lucky winner so we can meet Tuesday. Who's with me on this once in a lifetime experience...Be real and Be Serious:) The worst thing that could happen is you enjoy a week with someone new...The best is meeting someone to share their life with you for many years to come. It's supposed to be nice out too:) Can't Wait to meet my Cali Queen...

The principles of Tantra are fundamental for a healthy, mature approach to life, and the things you will learn about yourself and your approach to intimacy will empower you to change your life for the better. Our goal is to learn, understand and experience following:

- Live authentically and true to our self 
- Live healthy and attract quality people
- Enhance self awareness
- Develop sensual sensitivity
- Manage and Heal from past trauma and abuse. Overcome internal blocks
- Retain sexual energy, channel it to pervade all areas of your life and move to higher state of consciousness

I have some experience with the practice, interested in enhancing experiences and enjoy the host of benefits for our overall well-being. I'd be interested in a partner who is patient and eager to learn about this practice. I'm clean, very respectful, and spiritual.

I'm looking for partners to practice the art of Tantra. It's the art of connection and patience that involves trust building, yoga, touching, massage and mutual gazing. 

Age, race and body composition are unimportant. What's required is a good introduction! Please be, intelligent, adventurous and conversational.

So.. Here's the situation: I'm a dude lookin for some new friends. Thing is, I've never had a problem makin friends with other guys. Girls though, that's a different story. It may be possible that I've just been introduced to the wrong ones. THOSE ""friends"" normally just wanted to hang out during parties, drink all my liquor and then they'd disappear till the next party. And they'd normally want a free ride to and from the party. Not down for that. I mean, don't get me wrong, I definitely wouldn't mind having a friend that I can drink with, in fact, I enjoy drinkin with my friends, but I'm looking for friends I can also kick it with when we're NOT drinkin.

About me: Half Hispanic, Half Filipino, I like movies, tv, music, art, video games, beer, hanging out, drivin, among other things.

You: Be awesome, like similar things, be around my age like somewhere around 20-30, live near my area.

Fun Fact: If you're a Legend of Zelda fan, we might be besties. If you dislike Legend of Zelda, we might be mortal enemies.

Anywayz, if you're lookin for a new friend, I'm here. Send me an email if you're interested. If you wanna just text first that's cool with me, but I would like to kick it eventually. I'd write more about myself, but I feel that's something that we could talk about when we kick it. Also, I didn't post a pic cause this is Craigslist and I think it's weird, but I'll send one if you want, and I'd want one in return. I mean, I would like to place a face to the person I'm talkin to.

Or you can send me a Kik: S_Flame

What happened to all the love in the world? I am not talking about love between a couple I am talking about a love between two human beings. When has it gotten to the point where being sweet is very rare to come by and the women who are sweet are either very boring, taken, or don't live anywhere close to where you're seeking. Women nowadays have become shallower than ever and that is even when it comes to find a male friend trust me I know. Just because a man isn't as fit as you or a man isn't the same race as you that shouldn't give you the reason to just pass him by but it is your life and people have the choice to be ignorant. Then people wonder why a lot of women aren't happy and it is because they choose to be happy because instead of getting to know a nice good man they decide to pass him because they didn't meet the standard the woman has set which is not even a standard. Sorry for my ranting but I have just been seeing too much of this and not just on craigslist but everywhere else and it seems like I would have better luck finding the land of oz than finding a woman who is actually sweet and is actually looking for what she says she is.

With that being said I am just looking for a woman FRIEND I am not ready for a relationship right now but I do not want a woman who is in a relationship either she must be SINGLE. Also she must live in the BAY AREA and has some type of transportation. I would prefer a woman who is thick when it comes to her physique like nice thick thighs and a big butt but it's not a must and I don't care about race or age as long as she is legal. She must also be ok with a flirtatious friendship and I am not talking about SEX because I am not looking for SEX at all.

I need to do some business down in Santa Barbara, need a cat loving woman to take care of the cats for a couple of months. They are beautiful cats, they adore each other. One is small, dominant, not really a pain in the rear, but she likes it her way. Sleeps with me, take affection. The other one big and stupid, but really sweet. Loves affection, very needy. He's a nice one..

Both strays when I found them, think they brother/sister, came from same litter.

Please understand that I will screen very carefully, as these are my precious ones. If you have cats, they need to meet. The female, Zweebil, is not really good with other cats, but she can mellow. The male, Zekie, is pretty good with other cats.

They are very loving cats. My kid, who is SJSU, could stop by and feed them while I am gone, but they need much more than that; they need somebody to love them. And, they are spoiled; I adore them, they are so everything to me.

Middle age extremely responsible female looking for middle age extremely responsible male to enter a ""marriage like"" partnership without the mental, emotional, or legal attachment. Cleanliness is an important factor. Im neat and organized and you would need to be too. Ideally we would live our own independent lives, under the same roof. If we were alike and got along very well then that would not be such a factor. But for the most part I want my space and want you to have yours. I am looking for a partner to combine steady incomes with in order to upgrade living into a house with a yard, privacy, trees, grass, etc. Want to stress NOT looking for love NOT looking for sex. Am looking to upgrade from apartment to house. Prefer not to move into YOUR house. Prefer we both move into A house we can buy or lease with equal share of payment and both names equal on paperwork. I am clean, quiet, single mom of well behaved intelligent 14 year old. We like trees for neighbors best and love animals. I am not looking for someone to cook for or clean up after as I have my own job and clean up after mine and my own. And you would clean up after your own. Though I may not mind doing those things or shopping for you while Im out if you needed and cooking for you if you yourself had something more to offer in the partnership as well such as fixing cars, or can contribute to helping my needs in any manner in making my life easier as well. Mutually giving partnership. Please be Non smoker. Non drug user, though do not care about 420 if you absolutely must not a big deal, I can work with that for the right person who is mature enough to show consideration as I always would to you. Alcohol is your right as an adult but a flat out alcoholic does not fall into my criteria of extremely responsible. Heavy drinkers do not apply. Dont care if you have a past record as long as you were never violent or a child abuser/rapist. I will check. And you can check me too. MUST HAVE SOLID JOB OR INCOME as I do. Hoping to find a house in quiet Castro Valley neighborhood like the Forest Ave area or Dublin/Pleasanton. I am strongly interested in an area where I can walk out my front door and not have a neighbor walking out theirs 5, 10, 15 feet away. Im also super interested in growing my own fruit and vegetables so need a yard. If you are looking to split living costs with a female, ease the burden of life in Cali, and live in domestic partnership send me an email. This would be a long term partnership hopefully expectant of minimum 5 years though not necessarily a lifetime commitment. If you want to split the burden of life and have the benefits married couples do with 2 incomes then email me! Thanks

Why not?

And yes, we are and should both married or attached...but in need and search of more since we cant really change our current situations.... I guess we have already this in common if you are still reading this ad.

I'm not alone I bet... Life is way too short to keep losing time as we are getting older everyday...

I am hoping to find a nice and sincere woman... a wise woman...attractive too...

We can find ourselves in situations that seemingly have no end. My wife has become more of a roommate than anything else. Circumstances that I will not go into here prevent me from leaving. Been together for a long time and now we just pass each other in the night. There are stupid arguments, stupid fights, no ugly but dormant. 

I am looking for a confident, friends with benefits, or anything with passion. I want companionship, friendship, communication, mutual respect, trust and caring. I'm looking for someone, preferably married, who may be in a similar situation and looking for a little something more in their life. Let's be each others friend, companion, confidant and possibly lovers if it goes that far. Communication is key with me. I like to exchange cute emails and chats during the day. It's simply a lot of fun because I'm a also romantic at heart. I'm not looking to be your new husband nor am I looking for you to be my new wife. When we can, we'll steal moments away with each other.

I'm an educated hard working professional, funny, discreet, humorous, caring, polite, respectful, laid back person that knows how to treat a lady as a lady. I'm a romantic and caring person. I like to engage in funny give and take conversations with a bit of humorous bantering. I'm a passionate person who is missing much of that now in my life. I would like to meet and be with a special friend on many levels; intellectually, compassionately, as good friends that share and confide in each other and also passionately.

More friends! Female or male does not matter. Remember this ad is in the platonic section. I like to stay active and be in the outdoors. So I enjoy biking hiking and trails. I don't mind staying indoors too. I like to do a lot of things. I like meeting and getting to know new people. Message me if you have any questions. Hoping for people in the Bay Area or not too far. If you are not sure message me anyways we will figure it out. Put your favorite animal in the subject so I can avoid spam and include your age location and some info about yourself. A picture would be nice upfront or down the road but not necessary. Anything else message me. Looking for people in early to late 20s and even early 30s if you are young at heart. Would prefer college/university and working kiddos like myself.

Hi,

Looking for brother and sisters in the faith. It's good to have friends in the Christian faith to hang out with share testimonies experiences trials and tribulation we may be going through. Vent to each other, lift each other up in the faith and confront one another in times of need. I know ppl are looking for this out there bc I know a lot of churches can be harsh and distant amongst the very ppl that attend! Contact me with some information about you. If you are not a Christian and just want to talk or think we can be friends don't be afraid to contact me.

I am fifty three, five foot four inches and 190lbs. I lost my long term partner two years ago. My social skills are a bit out of practice but I feel it's time to make new friends. If interested, please reply. San Jose area and surrounding cities. Not looking for romance just friendship.

I'm sarcastic and fiesty. I'm passionate and stubborn. I'm crude and unapologetic.

I look feminine but often have been compared to a man because of my indifference, my sex drive and my rationality. 

I don't want someone who is easily offended.

I don't want a fat girl that smells bad.

I don't want a girl that won't put out.

I want someone who is real and genuine.

Ive been in love with love for so long, now its time for love to love me back.

My life isnt perfect but through life i have all that i need to live happily.

Friendship, the knowing/wanting to share time and space together and see if our chemistry could be one of happiness is the only reality worth existing. 

No need to force the issue, happiness with another to me is the ability to feel comfortable enough to be exactly who we are and want to be by the side of each other. With this notion so much emotions can be shared.

Disclaimers are: positivity, age 40 plus, ltr desire, ability to dream and honesty.

Voice verify and photo exchange. I prefer woman :)

Im a nice blend of femme and boi if a label is a must!

Ok universe, its your turn-i seek your guidance.

Hello,

Are you curious about being ""Bi"",
Have you thought about a Confident women control your sexual desires.

Here is a thought for you to loose your thoughts in: As you enter my bedroom in your dress, no panties allowed you walk in to see me waiting for you, you stand in front of me and set down on your knees. I walk around you and pull your hair back and place it in a ponytail. I tip your head up to look at me and you say ""Hello Mistress"". I then take my hand and place in on your chin and encourage you to stand. I take my lips and kiss you gently as my right hand slides up your right thigh and lifts your dress to expose your ass and I graze your ass and slip my fingers into your pussy to feel your wetness in the excitement to see me. I grab your ponytail with my left hand and start to kiss you deeply as my right hand and fingers find the inside of your pussy and you groan with anticipation. You start to talk, and I look deep into your eyes and you stop immediately. I then walk around your and wrist restraint your wrist and I lay you down on the bed and spread you legs open to your beautiful wet pussy, I then take a vibrator and place it on your excited and ready clit,,,,,,hmmm should I let you cum....

If this is something that excited you.....finish the story and we can talk.

Just to be clear I am not interested in back and forth email. Send me a picture and put a peice of paper with today's date, your phone number to voice verify.

In the posting title put - ""Sub ready""

by the way, You will start with me, your Mistress but Mr will be introduced at a later date. We are looking for a lady that is looking for a trusting, commited relationship, not interested in one night stand.

Let's be each other's date for Deadpool on opening day (AMC Mercado), Zoolander 2 the day after (AMC Cupertino), and together for Valentine's Day (your pick, wherever)! Then, we can have a break or whatever...maybe visit local coffee shops on the regular? :)

Please include a picture of yourself, your handwritten number, and a heart next to your number. If I'm attracted to you, I'll send you a picture of myself via text via app. Only after our date(s), I'll give you my real number, 

My bodytype is on the lean side of average. Please be hwp, or more/less average. Skinny girls, in my humble opinion, are just as intimidating as thick girls. Also, please be older than me.

I'm from the south bay and very rarely do I hit bars or clubs in sf, there are practically no lesbian social scenes this way. If you know something I don't please inform me. As much as I would love to walk up to a random woman and hit on her, I'm a bit nervous for several reasons. 
So here I am... Looking for you, looking for me. No age, weight, or background preference.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/w4w/5435024106.html,Violinist and psychotherapist in training,"
‎Update: I've been getting a lot of replies from men, so I just want to be really, really clear: I'm seeking women only. I'm not into guys, sorry. Really. Seriously. 

""Past the seeker as he prayed came the crippled and the beggar and the beaten. And seeing them...he cried, ""Great God, how is it that a loving creator can see such things and yet do nothing about them?""...God said, ""I did do something. I made you."""" - Sufi Teaching

N.B. Kindness, sensitivity, openness, and compassion are paramount. All other priorities, I've found, are subject to change.

About me: High femme, violinist, teacher, and psychotherapist seeking gentle, contemplative, altruistic souls with whom to give richly, love deeply, and grow in unexpected ways.

A few possibly relevant details: I'm quiet (punctuated by bouts of exuberance), introspective, and a tad intense; I take things just a touch too seriously; I love children's books and kind humor; I'm compulsively affectionate; and I probably want to read poetry in bed with you on a rainy day. INFJ, if that matters to you. I'm at my happiest when I feel I am making the world a little better, and finding the goodness and beauty in everyone I encounter - which is not to say I am always successful in those endeavors! A little ice cream, a long date with my violin, a compassionate friend, or some cat videos are good salves for periods of more gritty humanness. 

What I'm doing with my life: loving my clients with a fierceness that awes me. Playing and teaching violin, volunteering with homeless children and as a crisis line counselor, and finishing a graduate degree in clinical social work. Putting off doing the laundry. Doing play therapy with children in the Oakland school district. Eating too much dessert. Believing in the fundamental goodness of all human beings. And nurturing my sense of transcendence and the divine.

""I slept and dreamt that life was joy
I awoke and saw that life was service
I acted and behold, service was joy.""
-Tagore

My strengths: Willingness, empathizing, noticing people's strengths, losing at scrabble (actually, losing at MOST games, a quality which delights my little clients), being vulnerable with the people I trust, noticing and caring deeply about others' suffering and balancing that caring with hope, accepting constructive criticism, and admitting when I'm wrong. Well...most of the time! Oh. And walking in four-inch heels.

My weaknesses: Impulsive tendencies! Also, I'm a bit naive at times, with a tendency to assume honesty and good intentions - a quality I value in myself - and which occasionally gets in the way of my understanding where someone is really coming from! (If, for example, one of my clients is lying to me, I need to understand why, and help them address the feelings underlying said lie.)

You should message me if one of the following feels true:

-You're open-minded and care passionately about your fellow human beings
-You actively strive to make the world a better place
-You're deeply sensitive and often experience awe
-You like talking about feelings!!
-You regularly give your leftovers to the homeless
-You're open to friendship as well as dates, and you want to rock climb, play music, teach me to paint or tango, or make things together
-You're willing to open up and talk deeply about yourself
-You're monogamous
-You value spirituality/religion
-You love children
-You have a cat (or a kitten! Yay!) and will let me babysit
-You think it'd be fun to be friends with a future shrink
-Or you just want to. As Wendell Berry said, ""It is not from ourselves that we learn to be better than we are.""

I'm looking for a controlled violent relationship... Slapping, smacking, wrestling, punching physical fun.

I am not single and your status does not matter to me. I however, am not interested in including your other half. 
I consider myself intelligent, sexy, curvy, fun, and at times kinky. I would like to find someone open minded and very sexual. If your schedule is fairly flexible, and you think we might hit it off...send a message. It is preferable if you include a picture.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/w4w/5434355351.html,"Intellectual, Socially Conscious, Artsy?","
I am seeking the company of an intelligent woman. She doesn't have to have had climbed into the upper echelons of academia. I don't think academic success is a good measure of anyone's intelligence and much less their self-worth. But she should have wide intellectual interests and pursuits that include history, sociology, psychology, anthropology, social justice, journalism, historical and contemporary discourses concerning race, gender, sexuality and other social stigmas. She should not have a blind spot for intersectionality. She should be interested in advocacy efforts concerning stigma and structural and attitudinal prejudices. It is fine if she is irritated by the loaded label of ""intellectual."" I myself don't like it. But she should know she is intelligent. She should own it and try to do something powerful with it, for herself and the world.

I like someone who writes well, be it with a command for epigram like Wilde, or introspective and melodramatic prose like Proust, terse like Vonnegut, or endearingly bitter like Ginsberg. You should cherish detailed letters, text messages, and long conversations. You should be excited by wordplay. You should seem adorably smug after delivering a perfectly caustically witty joke and appreciate good comic timing. I myself am a better comedy writer than I am in delivered speech in person. I can be awkward and self-conscious in person. Hopefully some of that will come across as endearing.

I am philosophically opposed to mainstream conceptions of beauty that stress a thinner, whiter, ultra young look. I am a brown woman myself in my 20s with big brown eyes, long dark thick hair, dark thick eyebrows, ambiguous ethnic features, petite and somewhat thick. I don't care if you're over a decade older than me. I don't care if you're bigger than thick. Fat-shaming is reprehensible. And I also don't care if you're smaller than thick. Just be body positive. (Although I myself have self-esteem issues/body-image issues I struggle with inspite of my body positive philosophical beliefs, and it is okay if you're dealing with the same issues. We could uplift eachother.)

Personality wise, I like a very self-confident, assertive, dominant personality. Though I have my own variety of strength, I do like being submissive. I like someone who leads with a compassionate, considerate foot though and who doesn't dominate in a controlling, arrogant way. I like an empathetic, uplifting woman who is happily willing to provide me with reassurances when I feel down and want to vent. (I would reciprocate of course.) I like someone who is outspoken and who can handle my rapidfire questioning. I like a woman with a weird, mad streak and aesthetic who likes non-sequiturs and stream-of-consciousness banter. And I look forward to meeting a woman who will take me on adventures, late night adventures in her car or through BART or the bus or on bikes where we explore, grab some hot tea, and just pick eachother's minds for hours until we find some kind of catharsis.

I am currently going through a depression and existential crisis of sorts and so I would hope to find support in you and would also be happy to provide support in return. I have been trying to empower myself by exercising, listening to upbeat music and trying to avoid my habit of sulking with melancholy tracks, keeping my place clean, focusing on my academic and future professional ambitions, and actively trying not to dwell on negative things. I think expanding my network and finding a supportive, intelligent, like-minded woman would help tremendously. Hopefully I could be of help to you.

I look forward to hearing from you. Let me know your age, profession, professional aspirations/ambitions, your schooling (former, present or future), what your personality is like, your location, your hobbies, etc. Perhaps if we could have some promising letter exchanges, texts and phone calls, we could meet for a dinner and movie. 

Though I will likely be warm, candid, and flirtacious during our prior talks and meeting, I am not going to get idealistically overly invested in you from the get-go, and you ought to be similarly reluctant and cautious. I just want to live in the moment and enjoy your company while I have it and not worry about whether our connection will endure and get better, even if those worries will likely accumulate in the back of my mind anyway. I don't want to have loaded expectations and burden you with them. Let's not think about it too much and just have fun and perhaps help eachother cope along the way if we see it fit. If we don't click well, so be it. We can still wish eachother the best.

I won't give up! 

I've been looking everywhere for my partner...in clubs, support groups, out in nature, at the ocean, around friends, and family, at reunions, while pumping gas, shopping at Safeway, during shared glances at the red lights, while skiing in Tahoe, praying in church, yes..while watching Star Wars The Force Awakens, when I dream at night, during my am runs, during my lunch breaks at work, and on Craigslist.

Still I am yet to meet ONE WOMAN who is serious and ready to step into the world of longterm connection with a beautiful, fine, smart, resources, open hearted, loyal, woman..that would be...me!

Guess what world...I won't give up. Never will. Tomorrow is a new day. I'm as open and as ready and as committed to what's destined.

Ready when you are :)

It's obvious to me why this unfortunate girl has exhibited signs of blowing you off: she meant nothing to you.
You seem to have ""endured"" hours long conversations and an offer of marriage ""weird, right?"" but are now ....missing them? 
I believe her interest in you was nothing more than a sop to your ego.
You didn't see it going anywhere, but you liked the attention.

She is right to move along, and you should do some serious examination of your motives.

One of which should be wondering why you now shift your attention to the web site, asking everyone else to pay attention to you.

So i want your honest opinion (men/women)

So...ive been talking to this girl for a month. Seemed as if she really liked me. Cried over me and would be upset when i didn't talk to her. At some point said she would marry me--yea, weird.

Anyhow, recently i noticed she doesn't even talk to me anymore. It's no longer the daily 4plus hour conversations. Seems like she's not into me. Would message her and seemed like she's avoiding me. Affection isn't there anymore either.

What do you think happened? Or what do you think I should do?

- Intelligence
- Femininity
- Confidence
- Intimacy

I'm a free spirit and I don't have one or two strict hobbies to stick to; I like adventure and new things! I can follow and be versatile but usually I'm the one to lead; I've been known to be a bit more on the dominant side.

So, this may sound pretty weird but I am so tired of dating and meeting people who 1) have some sort of catch (they're married, not over their ex, or are pregnant..I know I have bad luck with women apparently) 

I'm REALLY looking for someone to settle down with. I am 23 but have an old soul, I know what I want and who I am, I've done all my partying in my teen years (quite a lot, over it). The problem is I keep meeting people who aren't ready to settle down, or don't have the ultimate goal of getting married. I don't mean to sound unattractive by complaining, I just want to make the point that I am seeking a woman who is willing to pursue me in the hopes of settling down with me (WITHOUT crazy baggage). 
I'm going to be up front, if I like you I'm not very good at taking things slow. I like affection, I like reminding my girl how amazing she is all the time and apparently that is too much for some people to handle. I fall hard, which I recognize is a flaw but am seeking someone who is equally excited about me as I am them. Someone passionate, a hopeless romantic like myself. 

Now that we have that out of the way..

About me: 
23 
Full time employed by a MAJOR social networking site (not going to post which one, but feel free to ask) 
Introverted, I prefer snuggling up and watching a movie to clubbing any day. 
Enjoys being called daddy in bed (Just to get that out of the way haha) 
REALLY into physics, philosophy, psychology and deep conversations 
Working on getting sleeve tattoos, I have some big ones on my arms already.
5''6 
I do volunteer work, I love to help others!
Really (and obviously) sick of the dating scene. I am sure I will get some smart ass emails, but whatever. 
I love to write and read! #Nerd power
I play guitar, used to be in a punk band. 
Suuuuper romantic. 


If you're looking for someone who doesn't play games and is ready for something real and long term (and you think we'd be a good match) email me with a photo and some information about yourself. Let's go on a date! 

I'm really into androgynous women, so points if you fit that!

Might as well state off the bat, to weed out unnecessary responses ha: i know this is a women seeking women ad, but no I don't want to be your curiosity satisfying, experimental lesbian fling. so if that's what you want you should probably look elsewhere. kay, great, now that's out of the way...

hmm. never really know where to start with these.. name maybe? yeah name is good. my name is Sarah. :P kinda hard to summarize yourself, but I'll start with a few fun facts- I'm thoughtful, good-natured, bit of a goofball, i love conversing about pretty much anything from lighthearted to in depth so long as the dialogue flows, though awkward conversations can be fun and memorable as well. i'm a nature loving, ocean diving, animal loving flower child, i enjoy a variety of music, so if you want a conversation starter feel free to ask about that- or be brave and tell me what you like first. :) i have a broad variety of activities i like, including but not limited to- hiking, swimming, daydreaming, reading, doodling, etcetera. i can be a pretty balanced blend of active and couch potato, which side comes out usually depends on who i'm hanging with. anyways, i'm on here cause work is a bit of a time consumer, i'd like to have someone to share new experiences with, plus it'd be great to meet more folks who fall under the lgbtq umbrella, though its cool to meet straight peeps as well, so long as you're respectful. additionally, i'm open to not just friends but potentially a fwb's, or possibly a romantic partner, depending. So if you feel we could potentially hit it off in either of these departments, don't be shy to message. i'm pretty approachable, yunno, like i said, so long as you're respectful and all that jazz. aka just don't be a jerk and we'll be cool. x)

when it comes to romantic/sexual interests, i'm looking for females ONLY, i can't stress that enough, but i feel like i have to press this, based on the opposite sex trying to hit me up for dates and/or hookups. guys, this is a woman seeks woman ad, c'mon now. moving on, where romantic interests are concerned, i'd like to talk to someone who is passionate about something, has some self confidence, someone who has a decent sense of humor, knows how to be respectful, is naturally an affectionate soul, and likes to go on adventures. someone who is very comfortable with who they are. Looks wise I am not incredibly particular, I like an array of body types but mainly my attention is captivated by engaging personality and a cute face. :) I am on the thicker/curvier side so whoever is interested from a dating standpoint needs to be ok with that. 

friends: can be of any sex: anyone who can appreciate a sarcastic sense of humor and can give it back, in a fun and playful way, not a snide way. someone who is supportive, real, laid back but also likes to go on adventures, as well. 

deal breakers for me when it comes to romantic interests: cigarette smokers, taking hard drugs, bad hygiene, lack of imagination and compassion- personality wise. also please be STD free if you are interested and want to contact me for potential romance purposes. putting it out there cause better safe than sorry. 

other deal-breakers, for FRIENDS, OR ROMANTIC INTERESTS: having a sexist, violent, racist, or really, derogatory in any way, type of mindset. just. nope. tryina steer clear of negativity here, folks! 

&,

if you are interested in seeing if a friendship or more can be sparked here, please send me a photo of you (keep it pg please,) along with the headline of ""FRIEND"" if you are interested in friendship, and ""SOMETHING MORE"" if you think we could have some chemistry, so I know you are real and I know what you are seeking. also i will be more eager to respond if you do this, cause it'll show you read my information and are actually interested in details. heads up, if you don't send me a picture i'll be less inclined to respond if we're being honest.

additionally, please only message me if you are in or near Milpitas/San Jose or can make the trip here, ideally though I'd like to establish good connections with peeps (friends or otherwise,) that are in my area. to clarify, if you are interested in more than friendship, the age range I'm willing to date is 20-30... in some cases, 35 at the oldest. Please take that into account.

another thing to take into account when messaging, make it a message that's worth replying to! I've had some thoughtful responses, but i've gotten my fair share of hi's and hey's, one worded responses don't do much for me. :P 

thanks guys, let's make something happen here. :) 

peace and well wishes. 



p.s. Dudes, if you send me a dick pic I will just laugh and proceed to delete it. Really, not trying to be harsh, but sending one to begin with is awkward, and you would get nothing positive out of it. again just to to reiterate, i'm open to a friendship with you if you are male however I'm only interested in dating women. 

p.s.s. I would like to disclose (since this has caused some confusion and conflict, though i don't know why) I identify as pansexual, feel free to look up the definition and ask me about it if you are confused, however if you are disrespectful about it we aren't going to get along. i am attracted to various genders and personalities, but at this point in time, i'm ONLY interested in women romantically. girls, if you are interested in me, great, but don't try to get me to change my orientation, or look down upon it, guys, don't look at it as an opportunity to try to get in my pants cause it's not happening. aaaand yeah, that long side note about covers it. haha. 

do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers

Hello Sister:

Im an older woman in my late 60's (Well shoot now Im 70 but its the same as late 60's LOL,) young looking for my age, or so Im told. It's challenging to meet new woman to do fun stuff with not to mention taking anything to the next level. 

This is my first ever personal ad and I just thought what the hell it can't hurt. 

Im androgenous and I'M ATTRACTED TO SAME. I'm very spiritual by nature and love to laugh and just have a good time over all. That can be doing most anything actually. Im clean and sober been working on it for 35 years now. 

I love someone that is present, loves animals (thats a MUST to me), infact if you don't like animals I really don't wish to even have a conversation with you. I don't remember who coined the phrase but it says ""one who has never loved animals a part of their soul remains UNAWAKENED."" And I also feel they dont have a soft heart. ok onward. . . . . Someone thats a GOOD LISTENER and can have fun anywhere anytime and NOT a drama queen so to speak. Life is just so short to be caught up in it. 

I live back in the hills up a dirt road, off the grid now for over 35 years on the same property for 33 years. Nature and I are one you could say. Im a Tarot reader thats very intuitive and insightful. I consider myself real, very honest, respectful and a little kid all at the same time. 

I am looking for someone like me, passionate about life, possitive and can live and let live. Someone that is spiritual, evolving, searching for a better way to be in life and simple at the same time. I have always loved sex but it is no longer my driving force. . . . (well until it is, that is. . . lol) 
Being a real, honest, caring and fun loving woman is my priority in a relationship. I would love to gather sticks and feathers and make that nest. Maybe we can sing the same song lol . . .

Ok so tell me about yourself and lets see what happens. Im open and curious about so many things. Lets talk for a while. Oh and even though I may hate to admit it, looks do make a difference to me and I would love it if you attach a photo of yourself it just makes things clear and not mysterious even if I do love a good mystery lol ...Thanks. . . . Namaste 

oh and ps..... Im a capricorn, leo rising, gemini moon/deep/fun/handy to have around the house. (in soooo many ways. . . lol lol lol) oh brother don't get me started. . . . .

I'm just going to put it out there... You never know. Single pregnant lesbian looking for a true partner open to starting a family. I'm newly prego (donor situation) I'm in my mid 30s wanted a child and didn't want to wait. I know this sounds weird but hey life is weird and unpredictable. So you never know. I lean toward the edgy femme side, prefer soft Butch, andro, tomboi etc. Let's just get to know each other and see where it goes. You have to be friends to become lovers.

The Backyard Coffee Co. address is 965 Brewster St. in Redwood City will be having a lesbian Ladies night this Saturday 2/6/16 It starts at 8:00 p.m. until 11:00 p.m.
It's a great place to meet and mingle with some local gay women! 
They will be selling different types of alcohol and of course a variety of coffees, teas and other types of food.
If you like to dance there will be a DJ playing some great music, I am usually the first one to start dancing, I love to get some cardio in!
Don't be shy, you need to go out and enjoy the night and you will probably make a few new friends!
Look for me if you don't want to sit by yourself, I will be the femme, dark brown hair with yellow-green eyes and you will see me dancing most of the night! LOL

I hope to meet other friendly lesbians that live close by since going to S.F. or San Jose is a little too far to go dancing and meeting other gay women.

Hi ladies... Good with your hands? I love being spoiled and taking things slow. I can appreciate a woman who can connect through touch. I have to admit there's something about being played with and violated I find extremely hot. I been feeling pretty submissive lately which is not like me normally and would like to explore it more. I have to be honest I'm not looking for a one night stand, couples, married or girls who are curious. Oddly enough I'm looking for someone I can connect with comfortably, dating or a friend but as this weighs on my mind I would love to also meet someone who finds all this interesting and at somepoint if the mood strikes has an idea of what I would like to explore and can't keep their hands off me;) Genuine connection: wanted. Age , race, body type doesn't matter. Be real, I am. You must be willing to meet in person at some point. Pic for pic. Xo

I want to spend the rest of my life with someone brilliant and happy, funny, sexy--maybe a little nerdy. Loves music, has a passport, can stay home and watch the game (which is basketball, duh:). Loves the coast, has a soft heart, knows how to use chopsticks and maybe even a skill saw. Looks hot in heels, jeans, dresses, bad ass sneakers. Worked through their stuff. Resourced and comfortable with that. Maybe maybe younger but I'm guessing a little older...

Me. Where to start? Ask what you want to know. Tall. Attractive. Professional. A little bit shy. Positive and optimistic. Very smart. Funny. Happiest in high tops and a cashmere vneck. Cute home. Great with my hands. Sweet. Charming. Believer in fate and chemistry. Fab date (even if home making cocktails and playing scrabble). Great kisser. 

If you think maybe we're looking for one another, let's take a walk or have a drink.

Now, for those of you who are still reading, I'm currently looking for something more promising and long-term. I'm not interested in any hookups, flings, one-night stands, men, mtf, ftm, married women, girls w/boyfriends, couples, or experimental 1st timers. I'm simply looking for a single, unattached lesbian that knows what she wants and is ready to pursue that. I prefer studs, but I may be open to femmes depending upon your personality. I am open to the ages of 21-35, but that also depends on your personality. A little about me... I'm fairly new to Cali. I'm hella down-to-earth and easy to talk to. I'm a great listener. I'm very compassionate (it's important that you are also). I enjoy doing spoken-word poetry and makeup. I love hard, and I'm very loyal and honest (sometimes too honest). All I want is someone who ""gets"" me. Someone who will try to understand me, love me, trust me. Someone who isn't afraid to try a new way or new things. Someone who will make time for me. Pretty simple, right?? Anyway, reply with your pic and an introduction if you're interested. Also, put your birth date in the subject line so I know you're real. Thanks for reading.

So I need some anonymous advice. I am curious to know the type of impression I leave on men. I think I know but I would rather find out. I am in my late twenties. I have two children. I have been divorced twice ( I left both times because they abandoned me ) I have never been selt ideal cards. I grew up poor and ignored. Sexualized and forgotten. by the time I was 14 I was raising myself. No consequences ever placed on me because I was too difficult as my parents put it. It was easier for them to ignor me than to raise me. my siblings All three were not raised the same. They had boundaries and stability. I did not. By 15 I was living on my own with boyfriends and friends. By 17 I had my own place with a friend dropped out of highschool worked 4 jobs at once was sleeping with multiple men ranging from 16 years old to 29 years old. By 19 I moved to 3 seperate states had been homeless for a year in california was prostituting escorting and working as a cam girl with 5 sugar daddies making at minimum 900 a week at maximum a few grand a week. I wanted love. I wanted to be loved. Not just told i was beautiful. Not just told i was loved by men who didnt know me. I wanted someone to love all parts of me. Especially the painful parts. I moved home. With a few grand and a nasty 5 year habbit when I was 20. I soon found the love of my life. Got married had my first child kicked my habbit and life was beautiful. Until he let his habbit consume him. He ignored me. I held on. By 23 I couldnt hold on any longer. I left. Jumped ship. Made the single regret of my life. I moved on forced myself to fuck as many men as I wanted to. Did whatever I desired. As I always do. Life was great. Met my second husband. Slept with around 17 men while I was married to him. He cheated on me first. He stopped coming home and eventually I left. I moved on liked a new guy slept with him got pregnant cleaned up my life. Still did whatever I wanted because lets face it, by this point my heart is non existant. But something happened this time. Something different. With the amount of men ive conquered. Had fall in love with me only my first childs father ever truly loved me. Who I am in my entirety. Then my second childs father messed up. Started cheating. Lying. Disappearing. He is flawed. Insanely flawed. I knew every step of the way what was happening. But never did I feel anger. I grew more and more in love. We were never together more of a soft spot where we would go when we needed those feel goods then back to doing whatever we wanted. But farther I fell. I didnt want to own him. To change him. To fix his flaws. I only ever wanted to love him. He came to my house and I admitted that I knew everything. No anger. No judgement. Then slowly I let him see my flaws and slowly he let himself love me. He is with someone else. And I know he will never tell me whats in his heart for me or what I mean to him because honestly its probly not that much. My feelings towards him are one sided and thats a hard pill to swallow. Ive allowed myself to love some one for all the broken pieces because I carry the same scars and this saddens me. I feel as though no one will ever love me the way I love him. Unconditional for just being him. No expectations. I feel crazy. That Ive imagined that these people have ""loved"" me but truly honestly they have all just left me. When I give my all its never enough. Never. And now after 27 years of pain abandonment horrible experiences that ill forever be impacted by I am this. This monster that only lets you close enough to hurt you. The slightest jolt to my heart and Ill tear out yours. The first love I never cheated on. Not once. Never had any desire to. And he still became bored. This 2nd one ive grown to have such strong feelings for that I dont sleep with anyone else. I have no desire to. I dont ever hurt him or do anything that would hurt him although im starting to believe he doesnt and never has loved me and therefore couldnt be hurt by me. Im so confused. Im let down. Im broken. And I dont know if theres ever going to be hope for me. I dont tell anyone about my past or how I was raised. They never know. They never know what broke me. Or the things that haunt me. But they all do the same thing. They all leave. Ive been told im a scary person to be with. Because Im so ""strong"" but truly im not. Im not mean. Im not intentionally vindictive (until someone tries to hurt me) im not anything horrible when the love is genuine. Im just a very alone little girl still waiting for someone to look me in the eyes and tell me no matter how difficult things get they arent going to leave me or cheat on me or hurt me that when I ask them why they love me their answer isnt ""because youre beautiful"" or "" i dont know"" but that its because they choose to see all of me and love me regardless. Am I a lost cause? Time is running out and im tired of trying to hide who I really am. Has my life and my choices and the cards ive been delt and how ive taught myself to cope sealed my fate? Am I truly as dilusional and unloveable as I feel?

So, have you answered that it is your BRAIN?

At ANY age we naturally want to Love. Our sexiest organ stops us from loving those who don't deserve us: ""If you settle yourself for less than you deserve, you'll get less than you've settled for"".

A woman of my caliber deserves approximately the same that ANY woman does: to go through life hand in hand with a Smart, Kind, Strong man. Yes, with ALL parts of his body working , as we love with our heart and body.
So simple, right?
Then why do so many people settle for less? Life Is NOT ""too short"". We have enough time to correct our mistakes even at 60+.

If you respond this ad, you'll get a long, long, very sincere and poetic profile of mine...

About You, the Stranger, Who Is Reading this, and Me:

None of us Has to reveal a lot of information right away. Still, there is courtesy, and gentlemen are expected Not to Hide their Faces and to be Verbal enough, so that it's clear where they come from. 
Cultural and temperamental differences are hard to overcome at this age.

I don't respond to those who send their images in silence. ""Women love with their ears"" as you know. I do know that ""Men love with their eyes"", and I can tell you that, if I trust you and send my image, you won't be disappointed. Eastern Slavic women are really attractive!

If I had to pick, it would be Panthers. But I'm a die hard Niners fan. 

I know that somewhere out in Marin or Sonoma County there is a single, loving man who is also ready for a long term, loving relationship. 

I am 54 yrs old. Divorced, white female. I am 5'3, dark brown hair and eyes. I am a plus size-full figured woman with olive complexion, round hips and thick thighs. I have an outstanding personality. I am funny, loving, intelligent and accept people for who they are. I am self sufficient and am not seeking someone to take care of me but rather, we take care of each other. 

My life is drama free and my home is warm and cozy. I love to cuddle on the couch while watching a movie or baseball/football, stroking your brow and running my fingers through your hair and kissing you softly. I do not smoke or use drugs and I drink socially and am disease free. 

I enjoy live music, festivals, SF Giants, SF Niners, card games, board games and the outdoors. I am a great cook and also enjoy baking (I am not great at baking but I do my best).

What is a long term connection? It's where we are best friends, we have a great time, we are honest and don't play games. We like to hang out, watch movies and plan fun things or just cook and BBQ at home. It's where we answer our phones and don't disappear from each other. It's where we don't need ""the talk"" cos we already know we are good buddies who will be with each other a long time. Not cos we have too but because we want too and will not give up the great connection we have. 

That is all pretty simple in a way yet hard to find. Prob CL us the wrong place but who knows right?

Yes if you know his story, he's not making many love connections these days. All men on here seem to want is sex as soon as possible. Is that you?

All the responses I get from any ad I post are:

military men from somewhere around the world - bogus fake ads
young 20 something's - yeah that's what I really want at almost 60
men who insult - they are waiting in the wings and biting on the bullet
men who hate women who are overweight
men who just say ""hi"" and nothing else
men who want to meet at their convenience - tonite in an hour or whatever
men who send x-rated pics and not of their face

So, this valentine's day will probably be the same for me. Think about the boyfriend I'll never have, think about
the chocolate I'll buy again and how I'll hope for February 14th to get quickly outta my life.

Never thought I would be doing this.... First timer here. 

I'm a married woman and I love my family. I have not been with anyone else but my husband since my early 20's and I am late 30's now. The last few years we are more roommates and when I try and spice things up... He gets upset at me and makes me feel bad about craving more intimacy and yes.... Sex! He is older then me and has a lot of stress to deal with professionally... I'm trying to be understanding but this has gone on for a few years now. 

I'm not looking for a one time hookup. I believe intimacy comes with getting to know someone and getting to know each other's bodies. Having someone in a similar situation would be nice too. I am not looking to change anyone's current situation. No drama here!! 

Little more about me...most ppl would call me pretty cute. I'm white, 5/4 height, hazel eyes, late 30s, professional and I'm a tomboy / girl next door kind. I love sports, movies, books and coffee oh I love good coffee! 

Looking for a tall, attractive, white man, nice build (doesn't have to have the perfect body, but someone who cares about their body), professional, funny and an overall good person. I'm a sucker for green eyes too. Age is open but thinking between 30 and 45 makes the most sense.... But really it's more about the person and chemistry.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/nby/w4m/5436148629.html,Looking for something specific,"
Wanted: Good looking, mature, intelligent, open-minded, local.

So here's the deal:

I am in a long distance relationship, have been for 2 years now, and it's going to continue.
But it's an open relationship, so I can date others if I chose to.
And I chose to, if I can find what I am looking for.
This understanding is where the ""open-minded"" requirement comes in.
This is not about just sex - you don't see this posted in the casual encounters section, or see me asking for a fwb, do you?
No.
This is about having someone to spend time with, go out with, talk to.
Dinner, concerts, movies, or just sit at the bar and have a couple of beers.
If the chemistry and the compatibility lead to sex, then that's fine, but it's not the reason I'm here.
That's where the ""mature"" requirement come in.
It also helps if you have a job and a car.
And please be in Sonoma County at least.
I am already in a long distance relationship and don't want another.
I want someone here, in real flesh, for actual human contact.
That's where the ""local"" requirement comes in.
Age and ethnicity are not an issue, as compatibility knows no bounds.
Also, if you identify as FtM, MtF, or ""fluid"" or similar, I am open to that as well.
And here's where I admit to being shallow: looks do matter, at least to me.
I apologize in advance for that, but it goes to the heart of attraction.
We are all attracted to someone ""good looking"".
I am 50, and I am told often that I am beautiful (sometimes cute too).
Obviously, I'll let you decide that for yourself.
And if you don't think I am, and you are not attracted to me, I understand.
It's natural and normal.
And finally, please be open enough, and patient enough, to want to spend at least a couple of e-mails sharing information and getting know a little about each other first.
Since this is not an ad for a ""casual encounter"", don't expect me to want to ""come over"" and ""chill"" before I even know anything about you.
Sure, some people can do that, but that's not me.
Ok, sound picky? Sound demanding?
Yes, it is.
I am a strong independent woman who knows what she wants and won't accept less.
If you can't handle that, just move on to the next ad.
No big deal. We all have our requirements.
And I wouldn't expect you, or anyone else, to settle for less than you want or deserve.
Thanks for your time.
Happy Superbowl !!

There are so many great places to visit, adventures to experience, people to meet and things to do that I look forward to enjoying every minute of every day. I enjoy traveling and discovering the major cities (and country side) around the world. I've been to Paris, London, Rome, Venice, Barcelona, Singapore, and Hong Kong... My favorite activity in each city is to take a walk early in the morning. Every city 'wakes up' differently, try it next time. My favorite cities are Paris, New York, and San Francisco , what about you?

I am an avid cyclist, preferably riding up the hills than descending them. I also enjoy crossfit during the week. 
I am fit and eat as healthy as possible , therefore, somebody with a similar interest would be perfect.

""Soul-mates are not found...they're made""...it is our intentions and actions that lead to a successful relationship....I feel that fate puts us in situations (whether it be CL or Peet's coffee) and what we do from there is up to us.

Hello gentlemen, 

I am a 34 year old light skinned African American woman and I am interested in finding a good candidate for a serious long-term relationship. The man that I am looking for is seeking the same in a woman. 

I am not looking to jump into anything. I am looking to spend time getting to know a good man that understands how to treat a lady. Someone who is down to earth, family oriented and enjoys both staying in and going out. I am looking for someone with a good sense of humor that can make me laugh. I am looking for someone who is hardworking, responsible and kindhearted. 

A little bit about me : 

I am single, a smaller bbw, caramel complexion, long brown hair, kind hearted and down to earth. I enjoy a wide array of music, movies and activities. I am hardworking, responsible and family oriented. As far as race is concerned, I date all races, colors and creeds. I do have a soft spot for white men, especially redheads... As for age, I prefer a man to be between the ages of 25-45 but I do understand that there are some younger men that are more mature and some more mature men that are young at heart. 

If you are interested in what you have read and would like to know more, please feel free to reply. Please reply with a picture and tell me a bit about yourself. Your picture for my picture. 

Have a great day and I hope to hear from you soon.

I'm in my early 30's so someone close in age would be great. Ages 31-42 work pretty well for me. Not interested in guys with more than one child. I live in San Jose so being local is a huge plus.

DWF, 52, Christian is seeking only marriage minded completely unattached and single Christian man. Marriage agrees with me and not desperate to remarry but casual dating has never been my thing. As a Christian it's important that we be equally yoked and this can take a bit when discerning God's choice for us. I'm a generally happy person and am happy in my career path. I don't have any children and if you have adult, independent ones that's fine but young or older dependents probably would not be a good match. We all carry baggage, that's inevitable, but please have yours under control and let the dramas of the past stay there. I've elected to not date these past few years until I was ready to open my heart in order to fully love another, with no reservations, and the time is now. I'm independent and have strong core values, such as honesty, integrity, loyalty, faithfulness, charity and love. I love adventure, traveling by car and by plane, exploring out of the way places and gaining value and knowledge by meeting interesting people and just learning in general. I'm a great traveling companion and will chit chat happily, sing to music and whatever seems like fun at the moment! Will keep you on your toes for sure and you will enjoy the ride! Vitals: I'm a BBW, 5'7"", freckled, be-speckled, formal education (college degrees), love learning in general, love documentaries, reading anything I can find; love doing arts and crafts; writing letters the old fashioned way; am generally old fashioned when it comes to values. I've lived long enough where I'm not impressed by what you can give me but who you are. At the same time I manage my own finances so please be fiscally responsible, have your own car and place. Please be between 35 and 60, have similar values and characteristics I've described above, at least 5'6"" and not be African American, nothing against that just not my personal preference is all. An advanced degree would be helpful so we'd have a similar education in common but if you are bright and love learning in general, that works too. I naturally talk using ""big words"" as my friends say and it's not to impress or make you feel inferior, I've been doing it since age 17, it's just the way I communicate and I'm confident in asking questions and saying ""I don't know"" and am secure in my past relationships so if you have a tendency for jealousy or possessiveness, guarantee I'm not your lady. The only games I enjoy playing are board games, not mind games. That's not my style and believing in speaking the truth in love. Serious responses only. Your photo gets mine. Please say more than just ""Hi"" and leave your telephone number. Cutting and pasting responses is pretty obvious and will not likely respond to any of the above.

It really should be simple, right? A woman seeks a man. Woman provides a brief description of who she is and what captivates her. Man responds. They correspond briefly, talk on the phone and make a plan to meet. I never presume chemistry; this can only be determined face-to-face.

That's really all I seek, an opportunity to meet someone in person to determine compatibility. This forum is just a starting point. I realize that I do not know my entire audience on CL and that I might be casting my net to those who are not my type (married/partnered, out for just sex, tobacco smokers, and unhealthy lifestyles). However, I am hopeful that there might be one or two out here that are like me - sane, stable (financially and emotionally), good career, give a damn about others and the world, and happy. 

Me:
SWF
Advanced degree
Successful career that I actually enjoy
Healthy/Exercise daily
Bikram yoga lover
Farmers Market enthusiast 
Follow whole food plant based diet
Avid reader 
NPR listener
Animal lover 
Bernie supporter
Active listener


You:
Good communicator
Grounded
Have goals/ambition 
Active lifestyle
Emotionally available 

I really do not have a huge laundry list of required qualities. It would be great if we had some shared interests and if you live in SF.

If you consider yourself a gentleman with good morals and respectful nature I would like to know more...perhaps your daydreaming behind your desk about getting out this weekend and yet don't know how to meet that special lady and I'm right here!
I'm a professional small business owner with creative talent. 
Traveling, culture and meeting nice people inspires me. I'm outgoing and friendly in nature and enjoy intelligent conversation with people from all walks of life. I'm non judgmental and generous at heart.
I seek a confident man who has refined his references in life, yet is open minded and adventurous...maybe even a little spontaneous! Yes, I have been known to travel at the drop of a suitcase. Decisions in general are easy when values are clear. I trust my instincts and know myself
well, yet there is nothing like a strong man to lead the way. I'm a little traditional in those ways and appreciate chivalry and hierarchy in society. Respect is... a good conversation starter...who do you respect and why?
I respect my aunt who taught me how to cook out of the garden and always had an open door to her giant family and friends. She was disciplined, always well put together, gracious, good humored and the go to person who could solve any problem. She encouraged us to challenge ourselves to be healthy minded and successful. She was the glue to our community. When I divorced after 15 years she did not judge and stood by me while I transformed and healed. BTW, I have a part time teen still at home and fortunately have a amicable co-partenting arrangement. 
We take exceptional care of ourselves and have high standards. Hopefully you enjoy endurance sports and the outdoors.
Tell me, ask me...lets chat here a little and maybe get a drink later? I will require some verification of your identity so keep it real...! Back to work for now but I'll respond with a current photo if you send yours with a sincere response to this post.

Grew up in Puerto Rico and the East Village in NYC. Been in the Bay on and off since 2002,mostly on.Navigating my life towards being a professional performing artist. Have some pretty exciting projects lined up and looking forward to this change in my life. I divide my time between Brooklyn and Berkeley. Still pondering a move to LA for my career.

Looking to meet someone who openly communicates, is down to earth and really fun! I was told by my best friend that I have a type, which I wasn't aware of but here it is: Passionate, wild bohemian spirited,and die hard romantics who have that skater-Surfer vibe like Anthony Keidis. I also like soft eyes and maturity.
My spirit animal is Alana from Broad City.

I'm Puerto Rican. I'm voluptuous/fat. I'm a feminist. A reader. A writer. A film buff. A comedian. A trained cook. 

I'm pretty shy at first but after getting to know me, I can get outrageous . I really value my relationships with friends and whomever I'm seeing. I'm affectionate, loving,intelligent and driven and seek that in a potential partner.My friends say that I am loyal, loving, supportive, playful, passionate,generous and inappropriately hilarious.


Please don't bother writing if you're older than 38 or younger than 27. I won't respond to emails that are ""hi"". We are all adults and should be able to write a paragraph or two about ourselves.

Hi,

I would like to make a new friend for endearing friendship.

He is very well-educated, athletic and fit, love of nature and literature, good cooking, play tennis and or golf, fond of classical music and a concert goer in SF.

Having said that, I think meeting like-minded person and who is within a similar age range would be practical to develop a long term friendship for outdoorsy activities and reading and listening classical music.

I am attracted someone that is intellectual, smart, fit and athletic, enjoys at least one outdoor sport, and classy and into cultural activities such concerts and stimulating conversation.

To be practical, that someone special be within a similar age range, 48-56 y/o, and is currently single, of course.

I'm politically progressive, well-rounded person with a diverse interests in performing art and science.
I like someone that is a well-listener and patient, and has a professional career with a happy outlook in life. Are you with a lighter baggage that you have more time for romantic relationship?

The answer is yes, please respond with some introduction about yourself and recent photo.

Cheers.

And she welcomed me with open arms. Recently moved to SF from NJ, after many years of visiting my brother and dreaming of living here too.

People who know me would describe me as adventurous, smart, caring and fun. My greatest passions in life are friends, family, music, food and love, not necessarily in that order! While I'd like to find one man who is a friend, a partner and a lover all in one, I'm delighted to make more friends along the way. I like men who are smart, kind, active, affectionate and funny.

I enjoy many outdoor activities, especially those involving water (flatwater kayaking, whitewater rafting and sailing), and walking anywhere and everywhere. I like all kinds of music and frequently attend live concerts. Music uplifts me, transforms me and makes me want to dance. I also enjoy reading, dining out (as well as cooking), museums (especially art museums), live theater, dance performances and movies. Good conversation is always enjoyable and I can discuss a wide variety of topics. I love to travel and frequently do.

I'm happy to share the activities that I enjoy with you and to share in the activities that you enjoy. Hopefully, we'll be secure enough in whatever our relationship turns out to be that we won't have to share all of our activities, if we don't both enjoy them.

I'm a retired, divorced Jewish professional, 66 years old and 5'3"" tall, hwp, with brown hair and green eyes. I'm a non-smoker and a social drinker. I have two grown sons living on the East Coast, both married and with families of their own.

No smokers, no one under 60 and no attached men! Please respond with more than a few words or a single sentence. A picture would be most welcome.

Wo, oh, what I want to know, will you come with me?

I want to live, I want to give.
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
It's these expressions I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold,
And I'm getting old.

Neil Young's words capture how I feel about finding a man who -- like me -- has a heart of gold.

If you're the one I seek, you're a kind, compassionate, caring gentleman between the ages of 60 and 75 who lives close enough to me so we can play together frequently. I'm hoping you share these qualities that describe me: educated, intelligent, and articulate; energetic and engaged; a non-smoker (of tobacco) but appreciator of wine, spirits, and the herb (all in moderation); financially stable and socially progressive.

Physically, I am of average height and weight (5'4""/~138 lbs.), and considered pretty/attractive...but attraction is personal. While I appreciate lifestyle differences, I'm best matched with a man who -- like me -- is Caucasian, monogamous, and omnivorous. I am interested only in men who are legally and emotionally available -- i.e., single, divorced, or widowed, and not currently partnered.

If you would like to start a conversation, I hope you'll reply to tell me about yourself and why you think we might be a good match. Be sure to include your age and location, and attach a photo. I am happy to reciprocate if we seem well matched.

Internet dating creates the perception of abundant supply. No matter how many people we meet, we feel there are still lots out there. The supply erodes the value of any one individual. As a result people pass over great relationship opportunities on the hunt for the ever-more-perfect one. We skim the surface, rather than diving deep into the the experience of dating. When you find that person that makes you happy, be grateful and stay with them. Know when you have won the race

I am:

Tall (over 6') 
Curvy, buxom, athletic
Fit (do some sort of exercise daily)
Baseball and Buddhism are my religion 
Love all sports (especially hockey and baseball) 
Love to cook 
Into punk rock music, but will listen to all kinds 
Active (walk/cycle every where, do yoga, etc.) 
Commuter (no car, cycle over 50+ miles a week)
Spontaneous 
Childlike and playful 
Openminded 
Confident 
Intelligent 
Love animals 
Progressive (tattoo's and piercings) 
Romantic (It's all about the chase) 
Sensual 
Spiritual (practicing Buddhist) 
Philanthropist (I volunteer regularly for LGBT organizations, and HIV/AIDS fundraisers)

You are: 
Single, available to meet someone, did I mention single? 
Non-smoker 
Great sense of humor 
Intelligent 
Employed 
Evolved 
Have a spiritual path 
Open to being intimate 
Compassionate 
Have a sense of adventure 
Be able to carry on a conversation 
Tolerant 
Curious 
Passionate 
Local (this has been known to be a deal breaker)
Tall (would be nice since I am an amazon)

I would love to have someone in my life that can text me with some little snippet and make me laugh, some witty little observation about something he's seen or done, someone that when I mention there is a meteor shower that night says I am on my way over, let's head up Page Mill and check it out. Someone that acts like a total fool in public because he's comfortable enough in his own skin that he doesn't care what others may think. Would be nice to have someone that I wake up thinking about, even when he's right there next to me

*The fine print* Have a great sense of humor, be intelligent, have a job, a means of transportation, don't smoke, be evolved, look for substance in someone, open to being intimate, compassionate, a sense of adventure, maybe a childlike sense of wonder of how cool and amazing things can be in this amazing place we live, be able to carry on a conversation 

Be the person that you want to meet...are you that super cool, funny, intelligent, fit guyer that I want to meet up with?

Be unfat like me. Funny. Tuned into the moment. Fully emotionally available and single for some time.

If you are over my height, 5'7"" that would be good. If you live near Santa Cruz, that would also be good.

Ages between 57 (why 57? Because many men at this age are starting to realize a young woman isn't really interested in them, and isn't in denial about ""I don't look my age"") and 64.

Surely, you can send an interesting email, a recent photo and tell me what you think about relational aesthetics, yes?

It does not matter if this post is a week or six months old. I am running it in multiple US cities and I am renewing the post every 2 days until the right lady comes along. When she does I'll pull this post but until then, the offer is open.

I am looking for a lady on disability or SS or supports themselves by working from home over the net.
She has to be at least 37 years old but under 66 years old and still active enough to enjoy swimming and day trips. I might consider someone younger then 37 depending on her personality.

If that is you keep reading you might like this idea.
You can be White, Oriental, Vietnamese, Asian, Spanish, Chinese, Puerto Rican or Native American.

In fact I am just over 1,000 miles South of Key West.

If you are raising a child or grand child, that is not an issue. I like children and we have some 
good schools here. A brand new Elementary opened up last month and it is only a couple 
minutes away by car.

Most of the replies I get that were actually generated by a human ask about the need for a Passport. This is still part of the U.S. If you are born here you are a US Citizen. You do not need a passport to move here. I do suggest you get one because there are day trips available to a different country. Out in the morning, spend a day in the DR or British Virgins and back that afternoon.

I have gotten some replies that say they would like to move here but they have been in prison.
That Is NOT a problem. If you are not on parole or probation you can move here any time you want.

Greetings. I'm hoping to find an older woman that is looking for friendship, or a relationship. I'm not looking to rush anything, as I am newly single, but I have completely moved on from that relationship. Ideally I would prefer someone that is between 38-53 years old. Someone spontaneous and compassionate. I love to do active things like hiking, day trips to the coast and exploring new restaurants. I'm 33, 5'8, with brownish hair and blue eyes. I live in Napa Valley. If interested please send me a message and hopefully we can set up a fun date.

I have been told that I am smart and sensitive. A little bit about myself: I enjoy travel, camping, romance, and fine dining and family and friends are very important to me.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/m4w/5437445110.html,Sweet Dreams & Road Trips,"
I acknowledge that this post is quite long but if you don't have the patience to read the whole thing then you are missing out.If you get it and are intrigued,please send me an email.All I ask is that you are not shallow and careless.I'm not ""ugly "" in fact really it's only a word,but I've heard I'm quite decent looking and im not demented but I think it's unattractive to wear a black heart.If you have a pic,please send it,this is only for my own curiosity and protection against spammers (the bad kind) and porno ads because none of those are acceptable for an intimate relationship.Friends are welcome too and if you can't tell I like writing.I love communicating,befriending with all kinds of people.
I try to focus on the road ahead and occasionally catch gripes of your silhouette in the sun to my right,I stare at my hands and my eyes wonder,beginning at your bare feet on the dashboard,trailing up to your knees up your sexy thigh and each and every thread on the sweater laying across your stomach which is breathing with every laugh or yawn.I listen to you talk for hours and input philosophical debate.I smile at your simple ways speechlessly,even the way you eat,the way your eyes light up when you're flirting back,the way you laugh at nothing.The sun outlines those lines and shadows in just the right way leaving a halo around your soul,irradiating pure grace.
""Focus"" I tell myself and my eyes flick back to the traffic ten gaping cars pass ahead,I flicker back to the valley between your beautiful breasts and to the road again,to your collarbone,to the yellow lines and brake lights ahead,to the clock on the radio and back to your neck line.You're sleeping now and we've been driving for hours.In your stillness,in the long silence,your essence swirls in the sun as if you are lively even though you are asleep.The breeze from the window distracts me as it delivers perfect little amounts of your sweet smelling skin across my nose,the way your hair smells haunts me and I just want to pull you in close so I can breath you in.A smile broaders across my face,a sweet,sweet smile of content as my eyes flick to the outlines of your beautiful face and how peaceful it rests there,trusting me completely and comfortably enough to fall asleep while I drive.My mind flashes back to the rest stop hours before and my body begins to burn as I remember the pit stop in the rain.The Windows fogged and we put the seats back and began drawing pictures on the Windows and without wearing you were on top of me in the drivers seat.
I dart back to my hands and find myself staring at them in disgust while my peripheral vision watches the road.I turn one over and examine one at a time.I peruse my knuckles,I peek at my eyes in the rear view and again I trail up your legs,your stomach,your neck,your chin,your nose and your eyes in a golden glow,I'm in awe as I gaze at you in silence,the sun streaming through the clouds and piercing my sight.I carefully grab my sunglasses with a smile and put them on to see better and laugh to myself as if you're so brilliantly bright I need them to look at you.I think of my hands dancing on your skin,gripping and tugging,pulling and rubbing,scratching and satisfying you until you shook in the cold winter air.The rain creating a beat on the roof,your hand prints on my skin and window.I shake my head and grip the wheel,These hands,these depressed hard workers shouldn't be allowed to touch something as illuminating and golden as your skin,never mind to taste your bittersweet sweat,As I drove south and out of the cold,The warmth and release that you are ""The One"" encompass me.
Sometimes I forget to see myself through your eyes and I'm humbled in this moment when you wake up.Your eyes trail my body from my knees,up my stomach,along my collarbone,up my neck,behind my ear and along my chin,lips,nose and eyes,you lean forward and kiss me on the check,then right below my ear with a goggle,whispering passed my senses sweet nothings of once upon a dream as you steal my sun glasses.You turn your hands over and shake your head in silence with a grin and say I LOVE YOU.
I'm not desperate,in fact I'm not hallucinating I just enjoy writing to you vividly.Imagination is a powerful thing,you see,this was a dream I had once.I'm not interested in the adjectives of life or who you were or what labels you categorize yourself in,I'm interested in the living,breathing verb of who you are.I've been waiting patiently for a while for days like these since I had this dream and I can't get the ideal of you out of my head...I'm tired of just sex.That's easy enough to get,I want someone to captivate my mine,challenge my opinion,lick my intelligence,stimulate my adrenaline and lay in bed all day laughing.Someone to kiss under the mistletoe on New Year's Day,Someone who my whole family talks about in a whisper and says""Oh I just love her,She's so warm,what a beautiful girl"" just because they're watching you play Simon says with my little cousins making them laugh,Someone to tuck my hands under their bra when they're cod and we're watching the ocean in autumn,Someone to paint tempered chocolate on some random Sunday afternoon,Someone to go skinny dipping with at midnight and hiking at 7 am or make hundreds of snow angles and sliding on a piece of cardboard down a hill,Someone to have crazy sex with because they picked out the cute-est bra.I want a name to doodle while at work and a text to look forward to.I want someone who I don't think I can find.I know you are out there somewhere sleeping,listening to music and watching the sun come up or God knows what else you might be doing at 2am.
Are you reading this ad yet,maybe I've met you in someway already and I just don't have a clue.I have a feeling I would know right away ;))
It might take months or years until we bump into each other some where in just the right way or someone sends me an e-mail and actually wants to meet up for coffee ?? It might be tomorrow or maybe just maybe it might be saved for last as most things best are.I'm willing to wait.I like writing to you ahead of time,I enjoy it.I feel as if perhaps someday years after we do collide.I'll be able to truly say ""See I was really waiting and thinking of you""I love corny affect :)
I guess what I've learned which,truthfull,I'm never quite done learning is that real love can not be found nor fabricated or settled for,but grown and a pleasant surprise I'm waiting for the day when I see you and that glow circles you as I was babbling about.I want someone to be my passenger on life's crazy adventures,but I don't need someone to live.I could function without you,I could breath,I could sleep around,I could ignore that empty passenger seat but the key is I don't want to.There's a fine line between need and want l'd rather want to share my life with someone than need to.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Well, as you might have seen, I'm seeking a woman who is comfortable in her own skin and who is comfortable being herself. I'm the type of guy that is attracted to women who are curvy, voluptuous, bbw, or whichever euphemism is of your liking...I like women who are cute, busty, curvy, with lots to hold onto, hug, snuggle, cuddle, and otherwise enjoy.

I'm a night owl, often venturing off alone when out exploring this little part of the world that I happen to live in, hardly the kind to stay home on a weekend unless you count the hours before noon, but someone who values the warmth and comfort that comes from being home. I like to sleep in, nothing good ever happens before 10 a.m. anyway.

I like used stuff, re purposed, or otherwise salvaged stuff, including clothes, household items, well, come to think of it, just about anything used and re purposed. I like flea markets, festivals, the beach, urban hikes, and long talks about nothing or anything. 

I'm pretty open minded as far as what I'm looking for and I really don't have any per-conceived expectations...I just hope that I can meet a kind and nurturing person, learn more about one another and maybe we'll hit it off...but we'll never know unless you write back. Wasn't that rather clever how I worked that in?

Beware of Rick Anderson. (Richard Anderson). 
He lives in sunnyvale and is 58 years old, but put 48 years old on his profiles.
He's a liar and a cheat. If you run across him be careful because he will cheat and lie on you and he frequents CL ads and S.F. escorts as well as many others.
He addicted to porn and sex, but he's not good in bed.
He's a cheater and could NEVER stay true to any woman let alone himself.
If you've been with him just remember their have been many women before you and after you. If you're dating him from time to time be advised that he's dating more than just you.
We are just another head on his pillow that he uses.
If you'd like to share anything about him with me you're more than welcome too.

DADDY is super fun, tall and in great shape (6'2"", 202LB, HWP), healthy (DDF), no drama, and filled with joy, energy, sense of humor, and plenty of stamina! He has been a DADDY for many years and has trained many newbies--- teaching them how to dress, how to behave, and how to please a demanding, firm, yet loving DADDY! 

He loves taking care of his naughty daughter-- specially if she is slutty! Perhaps DADDY caught her by surprise when she was watching his porn collections or when she was playing with mom's toys and dildos. He will put his little girl on his lap, pull down her underwear and spanks her bum bum red. She will cry and cry saying ""DADDY, I am so sorry, please don't tell mommy what I did.""

Daddy will teach and train his naughty girl how to be a sweet, submissive little girl. And if she desires, she can do the same things with her DADDY as the above pictures suggest! She is so delighted and her sexual desires and fantasies are all fulfilled by his DADDY so no need anymore wasting time with immature young men!

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING 3 ITEMS CAREFULLY!

1) IT IS MANDATORY THAT YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD IF YOU WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH DADDY. I WILL CHECK YOUR PHOTO ID IN THE VERY FIRST MEETING!

2) Put your favorite SEX POSITION in the subject line, so I can weed out spams!

3) Tell me the BASIC STAT of yours: age, height, weight, body shape, breast size, and if you are a newbie.

--Please be sincere, as I am. I know, I know, this is CL, a place for people to dabble in anonymous BS, but if my words call to you, do contact me, thanks.

So...
I'm a great guy, who happens to be sexually dominant, and I look for a submissive woman. Aren't relationships crazy? I say that with humor as I think one must keep things light in life. Sexuality is such a charged subject that I love it when it can be upfront right from the start. If we both are specific on what we want and easy going about it, I think our chances improve. I am looking for a special person. A woman who is kind, attractive and gracious. Feminine, and with a great sense of humor and has a small to medium build, 20's to 40's?(a good connection is more important than age). Do you have these thoughts of what it would be like to be submissive to a man? Perhaps you are curious and are interested in connecting with a special man so you can explore these feelings? 
Yes I am a ""dom"", but I refuse to take myself too seriously about that. It is just who I am, like how I am hardwired. I am a mature man who understands nuance and I am completely respectful. When a man and a woman, are very open and honest about their sexuality, and, they have an attraction to each other? And they take the time to build trust and have fun together? Then a true adventure can happen.
If these words call to you, send me a message.
Best wishes,
B

Flaggers...please take a break!

It's like going to massage center. As you lay face down for a normal massage. I start giving you hot oil massage, applying long strokes from neck to waist line. I move down massaging your feet, slowly working my way up to your calves, back of your thighs, then firmly rubbing inside of your thighs occasionally stroking in between your legs. I start massaging your butts, kneading your cheeks, spreading apart and pushing them back together to create tantalizing sensation between your legs. You are in control, I take your direction to stop here or continue.

If you wanna continue, I take it slow to build up for Big O. I switch to soft, long strokes from feet to calves, inner thighs, butt crack, back, all the way to neck. I start caressing your body, attending each part of body starting from ear, gently kiss your neck, shoulder, back, bite your hips, thighs, all the way to feet. I ask you to roll over. I start playing with your feet, gently lick them, slowly move up to your neck, down to your breasts, where my lips and tongue linger for several minutes while I kiss, lick, gently bite your nipples and cupping your breasts in the palm of my hands. 
Your arousal is soaring by this time. My hands work their way down to your hips as I continue to caress your body. I rub your mound through panties, occasionally letting finger or two slip into your panties and brush up lightly against your lips, constantly teasing you in order to build even greater arousal. Slowly I pull you panties down. My face is so close to your pussy, you can feel my hot breath as I gently kiss you. You smell amazing... Slowly I begin to trace a line down from your belly with my tongue, stopping along the way to gently kiss your soft skin. Moving in circles as I approach your pussy. My tongue softly parts your lips, tasting your sweet juices. I move my tongue up and down, occasionally darting inside. I can feel your clit getting harder and harder. God you taste so incredible. You are pushing against my face as I continue to lick your clit....

Couples m4mw m4w are ok but this is for her only. Please tell about yourself, pic and availability in response.

Did you like that I used the word ""pet?"" Good.

Call me different.. call me bored. But I'm looking for a special woman.
One who likes to make taboo immoral jokes, one who wants to do unusual sexual things in unusual places. A woman who is submissive, and will follow rules and take orders. And of course.. this woman has to be attractive. Its a tall order, and very hard to find. My imagination pushes the limits of freakdom, and Im looking for the same in a woman. Im not interested in cliche BDSM, whips, leather.. thats not my thing. I want to laugh and get hard at the same time, cum while I feel guilty. Experience all the flavors that can be tasted, and then come up with new ones. 

About me,
You'd be surprised, Im a tall, clean cut, very handsome white guy. Educated, successful. And very tired of normal dates, or pulling sluts at bars. I want someone unique and twisted.

Not interested in anything gay, or hookers, or anything like that so don't waste your time.

When did we decide it's OK to stop playing? I think you're never too old to have playdates. And I think autoeroticism (no, not sex in cars.) can be a lot of fun to share.Gentle(or not, your preference), respectful simultaneous masturbation. I'm told I'm very sensual in the act of masturbation, and I like for it to last for 5-20 minutes.The journey is the best part quite often. It would nice if you like toys, and/or are very, very wet. I'm not sure if I'm looking for an exhibitionist voyeur or a voyeuristic exhibitionist. I also love giving oral sex, and I'm very good at it because I love it, and I like for it to last awhile, too. I'm very non -judgemental about bodies and attitudes. I'm an african american with middle- of- the back length dreadlocks, and I'm 420 friendly. I'm average to good shape (depending on the day, I'm sure you can relate). You're pic gets mine. Actually, if you just answer you'll get mine. A non-naked picture, at that. C'mon, let's have some fun,some laughs, some orgasms. You are assured of the utmost discretion, as I hope I have with you, as I'm a very public figure. I love intelligent women. I always stop to pet kitties. I mean real cats, not a euphemism.And I regularly buy myself flowers. See ya soon. Let's play!

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/m4w/5437263049.html,Looking for a wonderful woman for a LTR,"
I would really like to meet a fun outgoing female who has goals for herself and is making something of herself in life. I am open to talking to anyone, regardless of their situation, but the main thing is that you are ambitious, know what you want to do to improve yourself, and that you want to reach whatever goals that you may set for yourself. I like to see people succeed and to be happy in life no matter what it is that they are doing :) Even though I am interested in a person that is going to school or already has an education, I am not ruling out those that don't have an education and that have other goals for themselves. I am totally cool with the idea of you just being a stay at home mother and taking care of your man and family or that you are in a difficult time in your life and need a change for the better. Whatever your situation may be, I am open to it as long as you mean well for yourself and others.

I would like you to be looking for something serious. We can start out as casual until we know things can progress properly. I would love to start a family at some point and it would be great if you have the desire to start a family too. It is my preference that you have no children. 

This is the main thing I want to put out there about my situation. I travel a lot for work and I am only back in the state so often for short vacations at a time. The ideal situation that I would prefer is to be able to find someone willing to travel with me on the road, whether it be permanently or temporarily, given your situation. I am willing to be with someone that can deal with me being on the road but there has to be trust and honesty if that situation is to work. At that point, it would be a long distance relationship and a lot of people can't deal with that. That is part of the reason why I haven't been able to have a steady relationship in a long time. I haven't found someone willing to travel with me or that can deal with me being gone for periods of time. I have plans to eventually get a place of my own but until that happens, I would love to have my partner travel with me and start a family while out on the road.

Now, for some of the other finer details. I am looking for a sexy beautiful Latina. That is my preference but I love all races and I am open to all that find this ad intriguing. I would like you to be healthy, clean, active, and one who takes care of themselves all around. I am active and like to be on the move so it would be nice to have someone that can do the same. I would like you to be average, athletic, or fit.

When it comes to sexuality, I would really like a lady that is kinky. The more kinky the better. I love sex and love to be adventurous so I would love to have a partner that is the same. I'm not saying that you have to do everything but having an open mind would be a great asset as well as having the willingness to explore while enjoying the moment for what it is. Overall, it's about mutual satisfaction of physical activities while having fun and a good time.

A little about me. I am a stable man. Mentally, emotionally, and financially. I take care of myself and those that are close to me. I am respectful, outgoing, well versed, and open minded to everything in life. I respect people's boundaries and don't impose anything upon someone that isn't willing to accept it. I love life and I love enjoying life and if I can allow someone else to do the same, then I'm all for it :)

I am a rocker type guy. I have spiked hair, mustache, and a goatee. I know it's not for everyone but that is how it is for right now. Nothing says I can't change it given the correct circumstance and I do tend to change my look from time to time depending on what kind of mood I'm in. I have nice clothes too and I can dress proper when needed. Other than that, I am a jeans and band t-shirt kind of guy. I don't have any tattoos but I do have several piercings though nothing crazy.

I know it may seem like I am asking for a lot but it really isn't. I just want to find my other half that is willing to start a family with a loving guy while being on the road instead of in a solitary place. I know she is out there :)

If you are interested, please don't hesitate to tell me about yourself and ask any questions that you may have.

Age preference is 18-30. Please be serious about traveling with me and starting a family.

Please put ""Travel"" in the subject line so I know that you are real and that you read and understood my ad.

I am looking for someone who is submissive with a little fight in her. Even though I am into the bdsm lifestyle, I'm not just looking for a sex slave. I want something more. I want My equal and best friend outside the house as well as My love toy inside. Have an opinion that is your own? Good, stick to it. Just because I am a Dom doesn't mean that I am a dick or that I want someone who is a Yes Sir, or what ever you think I will agree with personality. Know your place is by My side and trust that I know what is best for us. I know that sounds a little contradictory, but if you have lived this lifestyle then you know what I mean.

All that being said I am always up to try new and fun experiences, food, travel etc. Age, race, body types, whatever a creed is lol, does not matter to Me but how you generally treat people does.

So if you are a real woman who can handle what I'm looking for and you want the same, get in touch with a few words describing yourself, a couple pictures and we'll take it from there.

I will be selective but if I can put together a group of about 5 guys, then I will host a kinky Superbowl party. Kinky as in bondage, spanking, forced oral, safe SM/pain play, and maybe you have a kink to add.

You don't have to be into every kink on the menu (that's called getting consent). But you do have to be seriously willing to participate in (not merely watch) at least a couple.

Novice is okay. I can, err... show you the ropes. It's cool if you're usually strictly the sub-bottom or the Dom-top. However, I prefer guys who are willing to take on both roles at different times during the game.

Arrive at my house about 2:30pm so we have time to discuss toys, techniques, preferences, fantasies, and most importantly limits and safety. Kickoff is 3:30. Our kinky games may start a little earlier.

Price of admission is a dish of food to share. No alcohol or street drugs.

Email full stats, kinky experience (if any), and kinky interests. Cock shots are a minus, but a face pic or a torso pic is a plus. Feel free to ask questions.

You don't have to be a model (I'm not), but this is not for someone who is hesitantly curious. You must be sure you won't run screaming for the door when our games begin.

I'm looking to have my hands roped out of the way while you fuck my face. The bondage doesn't need to be anything fancy -- just enough that I know you are in charge and that, as they say, resistance is futile. Your cock in my ass is possible, but not required and it won't happen unless we become ongoing FWB.

If you're into it, then my cock would enjoy one or both of your holes -- with or without a bit of rope.

I do have an O-ring gag and some other toys, but those are optional.

I'm bi, white, 100% masculine, educated, and in my 50s. I have a bear/beer belly and a medium thick 6"" cut cock.

I'd prefer to find an ongoing, but no strings, bondage fuck buddy. I'd prefer that we take turns hosting. When I can host, we can use the hot tub on the back porch and the playroom with a few strategically placed eyehooks.

It's cool if you're out and proud. It's cool if you're downlow because you value privacy. But don't reply if you play behind the back of your significant other.

After all the recent rain the parking area up at San Gregorio is reopened. I'm going to leave Santa Cruz around 9am. It takes about 40 minutes to get there.
If we make plans to go, they need to be all buttoned up by 9. I know I'm an early riser, and I'm planning on staying until about 4 so you should have a lunch and plenty of water. 

If you don't know San Gregorio, you should google it, its one of the most beautiful beaches on the West Coast. It also happens to be nude and mostly gay. I'm not talking about the State Park entrance either. There is a private entrance further north from the State Park entrance.

I know I do.. I would like to find a guy who is 100% bisexual , straight acting, bicurious even, and fantasizes about being in a polyamorous triad with a man and a woman that you are equally attracted to. The sex positions and possibilities are endless. Imagine no longer being on the down low, or suppressing your curiosities, but having a loving supporting girlfriend who encourages your bisexuality. I am interested in experimenting to see how this works. I am very interested in bi men, and I watch primarily gay porn and it turns me on. I also know how to wield a strap on. I'm real, and interested in offline relationships so should you. I love watching and directing guys to suck and fuck each other. I would love to be DP'ed and used as a sleeve, cream pies you name it. I would also like this to be about more than just a casual sex relationship so if you are open for more that would be great.

When a Relationship is ""right"", one does not necessarily think of himself first. When It's ""right"", both tend to communicate, compromise, share, and learn. When It's ""right"", there is growth and strength. So much of Life is about Sharing, in the sunshine and in the rain. Kindness and Intelligence seem so difficult to find, especially the kindness. I live outside of SF, 90 minutes away. I visit, sometimes often, to see friends, watch plays, stare at paintings. I would very much like to meet someone interesting- somewhat sane, somewhat sure and steady, and pretty masculine. Another season is around the corner. Loneliness sure is Tough. No Expectations.

This is CL, what a joke it's been for quite some time now. I'm real, but my question is if anyone else on here is, so sad so sad.

I'm looking for a REAL man of integrity who will ACTUALLY take a plunge and take me out and about for a very simple non expensed date to start with, just to get to know each other better, and see what the future might hold for us in the romance department. NON expensed meaning to say that I am NOT seeking to be wined and dined or receive gifts of ANY kind.

Let's NOT get into the superficial conditions of picture exchange, age numbers, and your expectations that I am a sexy Diva or Cover Girl model, I'm NOT. But I'm NOT butt ugly either, so let's rely on your personal taste and preferences in girls when we have an actual date. IF you feel no chemistry at all, then nothing ventured nothing gained, and you can just be polite and tactful in cutting our date short, no problem as there are many fish in the sea for the both of us, but maybe just not on CL.

If you are not willing to take a gamble with a semi blind date, and demand that I prove that I am a Goddess before you exercise a little bit of some male chivalry towards me, then I'm not the girl you're looking for, SORRY.

I'm an Asian TV/CD in San Francisco, available nights, enough said for now. Please pick me up/drop me back off, as I'm no different from any other genetic girl you would ask out on a date.

As a start of your integrity, please take the time to WRITE an informative email to get things rolling. We are not at the stage of giving out phone numbers yet, and I'm NOT a pre-teen who text messages constantly but has no social skills.

I am TRULY a very sweet girl by nature, but if I do sound disgruntled, then please blame all of your fellow Brothers who have no integrity and have made me suffer their immature head trips. It wasn't me, I'm REAL.

Here goes nothing, and I do truly believe that, so prove me wrong.

Like the title, I am seeking a couple that ranges from age 21-35. I am seeking to be a long term or short term ""girlfriend"" or close FWB. Though I may not have much experiences (sexually), I'm hoping this couple can teach me new things and have many great experiences. Sorta like a mentor (haha) in a way, but with a sexual twist!

What Tenn Thought of My Bedroom 

age: 68

On a foggy eve in the fall of '80, I caught a glimpse of Tennessee Wms. under-reaching for a bottle of gin off a shelf at a liquor store on Geary Blvd. Dressed in the habiliment of a 19th century Greek mariner (curly-hair wig and all), I was rapidly trotting to a disco on Polk St. Sans much consideration, I went to him, and handed him the bottle. ""No need to thank the kindness of this stranger"", or something else of that corny ilk I uttered to him. He was taken aback timidly by my ""high"" countenance & out-of-place costume. We sallied while he shopped and paid for snacks. I asked if I could walk with him to his destination, Colony Hotel. Upon reaching the foyer, he asked if I would visit with him. Lying to him, I stated that I was on my way home to feed ""Mugger"", my golden retriever.

When Ten Ten and I entered my cottage, I showed him to a seetee and later handed him a highball glass with ice. He inquired where the spiral staircase led to; I responded, ""to the ballroom."" ""Ballroom? May I see it?"" I toured him into my inordinately decorated bedroom, alight with five honey-wax candles in glass and wooden lanterns that cast arabesque silhouettes against the carroty bamboo ceiling. The ersatz tapestries (thumb-nailed quilts) quivered in the cross-breezes as we heard Muddy Waters jazz emanating from a neighboring cafe. He raised his eyes to look upon an embalmed Sicilian owl and Caucasian mouse perching on a rosemary branch above my German-made bed. Tenn was further roused by the scent of blooming orchids I cultivated on a portable fountain on the deck overlooking the steeples of twin churches.

He seemed nostalgically transported; closing his eyes and dilating his nares, he came closer to me and said he felt akin to being in the presence of the Moon Lake Casino. He asked to lie serenely next to me and experience pillow talk between us.

No longer am I this quixotic lad, neither are you a gallant poet. Nevertheless, I pine to be visited by a very mature ""man of letters""; a gent steeped in sublime sensuousness with whom I can explore The Arts, intimate conversation, and perhaps physical expression. Tennessee gave me hours of delight. The other side of joy is that it is too frequently followed by crawling periods of grief over what is lost.

So I was told by my last ""lady friend"" that ""I don't know how to kiss"". So, I'm here, seeking a (female only, no men) ""Kissing Instructor"". Perhaps I'm too light in my kisses, perhaps too strong, perhaps too quick ...... I don't know!!!

I'm looking to build a connection with an intelligent, fun and adventurous tall, HWP guy who'd enjoy spending quality time with a sophisticated soul mate -- a bloke who's a comfortable conversationalist talking about the day just had, the road ahead as well as life in all regards either over morning coffees, while sharing a bottle of wine or occasional dinners (in or out--I'm a great cook), during walks in the neighborhood, while sitting back on the couch with our feet up or cuddled in bed. Couple of other things, ideally you also have an easy sense of humor plus you're a man open to building a real M2M friendship. With that said, should we eventually find that we bond well and want to take our friendship to a more intense and personal level, so be it. Not interested in a married or partnered man.

I'm a 6.1, HWP/FIT-195, attractive, smart and masculine 60 y/o professional. You'll find that I'm well traveled and have had the excitement and benefit of working with both start-ups and Fortune 500 businesses. I engage well with younger men as well as my peers -- but will be most drawn to a sensitive, tactile, passionate 40s-50s man who has as much going on between his ears as he has between his legs. BTW, I'm HIV-, DDF, nonsmoker, clean and clean cut -- prefer similar.

Have I intrigued you? Hope so. Let's get together for coffee or wine and see where life leads us.

We are looking for bisexual only!

We are a married and stable couple, and nothing is going to change that. Our cuckold adventures have only proven to strengthen our bond. We are seeking open minded friends for longterm friendship/relationship. We are 29 & 33 (him). I am from Europe and half Latina, he is white and from the bay area. We are both good looking and in shape....you be, too!

I am not a sub....only he is....and new friends should not expect to dominate me at all. This is about me having fun, sexy times with others while giving him the hardcore humiliation that he needs.

Men:
I'd prefer you to be bisexual, between 7 & 8 inches - I'm looking for a bull who is comfortable being dom over him, and enjoys such things as forced feminization, forced-bi, humiliation and bondage.

Women:
I'm interested in both bisexual women, and man-hating lesbians to help me transform him into a slutty little princess and laugh at him

**Special attention goes to couples and bi ladies that would enjoy helping me torment the hell out of him.
IMPORTANT!!!
Send a picture and a message about yourself(s). Your (face) picture gets ours!

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/msr/5436623780.html,"Sexy Bi couple for other Sexy Bi couple, ongoing friendship/poly - mw4mw","
We are an attractive married couple looking for close friends in another bisexual couple. 

We aren't seeking anything that is purely sexual....we want our friendship to grow into a lasting bond. We enjoy a wide array of vanilla activities, and we are very active in that department. We enjoy live music, hiking, dancing (salsa, clubbing, rollerdisco), travel & getaways, exploring new restaurants, or just cuddling up to a good movie on a chilly night. If we haven't ever tried it, we're game for new experiences!

We hate to mention this here, but we guess it's an inevitable subject, as we also seek a relationship of an intimate nature. Please keep in mind that the following is a parallel to the relationship as friends, and that we seek a real poly relationship based on trust and love, eventually.....so here it goes.......
- As far as sexual compatability goes, we are both bisexual. We live a kinky life and have a D/s relationship. Our male half is submissive in nature, really sweet, and a bottom with men. Our female half wears the pants in the relationship, quite litterally. We are a very outgoing couple, and in public you wouldn't have a clue.

When we play kinky, it is of a cuckold nature. We love to walk the edge of tease and denial play with our cuck, as well as some physical feminization. Our female half is not submissive....and does not seek to dominate anyone other than her husband, but to share an equal standpoint in the bedroom. We have had a relationship like this before, but sadly we relocated. 

Essentially what we seek is an outgoing attractive couple, who also wants to have a poly and lasting connection with us. Who is intrigued or into cuckold play/relationships....and are comfortable with the role of 'dominant bull' over our cuck. We feel that an ongoing connection is the best and safest way for us to take it to the next level....so if you're interested in meeting us for a drink or a bite to eat, write us a short email about yourselves! 

Please include a G-rated picture of you both together with your response. Let us know when the best time for you to meet up with us for a casual initial meeting would be and we'll make it happen!

Looking forward to getting to know you!

Welcome. Thanks for opening my ad.

You are already weird in a nice way since you're looking at Craigslist ads (yes, people really did used to meet this way!) in a most retro fashion. I'd have expected you to be glued to Facebook, Tinder, Instagram, or some other smartphone app, and not to have much time for old-fashioned words typed on a screen.

But, apart from your willingness to meet someone via CL, or at least be entertained by the ads (hopefully you are not just doing a research project), just how weird are you?

Namely, did you notice the ""51"" that was also part of my ad? Yes, I am more than twice your age. I suspect you didn't notice that, so there's your warning not to read further.

Indeed, I want a friendship, and hopefully sexual relationship, with someone ""scandalously"" younger. What can I say: I love Nabokov; I love being a teacher as well as a student, I'd like to find a muse or a mentor as well as being one; I think power disparities (youth and beauty vs. ""wisdom"") are fascinating; I think a relationship that is a conspiracy a deux and that everyone else in the world disapproves of is hot.

The odds of finding this are minimal, I know. But, I've corresponded enough with those your age to know there are girls who share the dream. Especially, for some reason, at UCSC. (There's something about slugs -- ha!) 

One or two I came close to meeting, but for those particular individuals I failed the looks test (damn digital cameras!). I think I'm not bad-looking, and I have a nice smile; I'm tall (6' 2 1/2"") and have blue eyes and shaggy brown hair. That said, you're dealing with a character actor, not a leading man, so to speak ...

I'm a writer, editor, and photographer, and most interested in hanging out with an artistic or musical girl. Scientists can be sexy too, and anyhow beggars like me can't be choosers, so just bring what you have.

I grew up almost friendless and being called queer throughout school. I didn't have any relationships at all until I was older than you are. Late bloomer. 

Now, I'm boringly hetero (though adventurous within that -- I don't like conventional sex roles and stereotypes) but certainly queer-friendly. I do have a bi woman friend who'd play with us both and is much closer to your age, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

I madly love most types of music, though leaning more toward classical, trad jazz, some classic rock, lots of woman singer-songwriters, Sinatra and the rat pack. 

I like good beer and cocktails, plus single-malt whiskies, though at the moment I'm enduring a low carb diet (sigh). Good weed is an occasional pleasure, though a lot less than I used to. I'd also try molly -- or whatever they're calling it these days -- again if I knew it was legit. But, I'd rather enhance my life by looking at you and listening to your voice than via chemicals.

I'm not sure what to add, given that likely I'm whistling in the wind anyhow. But just in case I'm also whispering in your ear, well, I'll post this and perhaps refine it later.

I expect replies from the auto-spammers, as well as from the brigade of immature guys who like to pose as girls and fuck with people who dared to put their head up above the parapet and post something a little different. Sadly that's the way of CL these days.

So, no offense, but if you respond, I'll expect you to prove that you're really a girl by attaching some fresh photos that are real, not ripped from someone else's FB profile or whatever! Or, you can record a voice message for me and attach it to your message. Whatever you like.

If you'd like to make my heart leap happily, use the subject line ""It sounds like you might be describing me.""

Cheers!

I live as a male in my public life, although I don't feel like one. I'm feeling the urge to face my fears and come out...but I don't have the guts. I'm so affraid of losing my friends and family...but I can't really talk to anyone about it. I'm seeking friendship and support from the TG community....those who have either been there, or are going through the same thing, currently. 

I know this all sounds very needy of me....and I guess it is. But, I have a lot to offer, as well, in the form of friendship....an open ear....or a hug, when you need one. I'm not looking to cry my eyes out for hours on end, but to learn to grow through friendship and association with like-minded people. At the moment, I'm not very comfortable as a girl...physically and emotionally. You can pretty much count on me being male when we meet in public...but hopefully, with the right support, that will change over time.

I'm not looking for sex....or a 'playdate'.....I'm looking for friends who will accept me as I am, and be there for me as a friend. Let's get to know each other....I'd love to hear your story.....

well, well, I am looking for someone who wants passion in her life without the headaches of a traditional relationship. If you are older than 40 then you know what I am talking about. We both have happy lives and all we want is a little extra spark once in a while. 
We both also know that relationships come in many different flavors. After living in the bay area for the past 20 years I have met couples with really strange arrangements. I have a girlfriend with whom I am happy with but we rarely have sex. Of course we have talked about it and the conclusion is that I need someone else to enjoy the physical intimacy that I am looking for. 
I expect you not to pass on judgement on me for this. As I will not judge you for your lifestyle or reasons why you are doing what you are doing.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/msr/5436256980.html,Hoping to make a friend... please and be pleased. - 40s - m4w,"
Thanks for checking out my ad.

Not sure if CL is the right place for finding what I'm looking for, but trying it out. For sure you should know that I am not a habitual CL poster.

Basically, I am a married man looking for a woman for friendship and the affection that I am missing. I am not the type to prowl the bars etc. and play games with a woman so I can get what I want. Just because I have come to terms with the fact that I need to find someone outside my marriage, I still don't need the additional guilt. So here I am!

First off, let me make it clear that I am in no way looking to change my home situation. I do love and I am devoted to my family. It is a tricky situation that is not easy to explain (not that I would on CL, LOL) but the bottom line is, I have been feeling the need for what I am missing for a while now and have not acted on it for obvious reasons. Now, after a few years, I've realized that this lack of balance in my life is creating more bad than good, so I am looking to fix that.

More about me... I'm a white, educated man, in my 40s, living in San Francisco. I am very fit, good looking (at least that's how I see it :-)) and energetic. I very much enjoy being active. To me stagnation is the true ""killer.""

I'm the clean-cut, professional type and clean in every way. I take pride in taking care of myself, inside and out. I am also very laid back and easy going. I take people for who they are which includes the good and the bad. I don't judge and don't like being judged. For sure, as you get to know me you will feel very comfortable being yourself around me.

I'm here hoping to find a friend that I can see on a regular basis for conversation and more. I don't care if you are also married or not just as long as you will accept me as I am. Age (older or younger) or race is not important to me as confidence and physical attraction is. If you are not supper fit, that's fine. That's also not a priority for me. What I hope to find is someone who will be motivated to make me happy like I will want to make her happy... someone who is fun under the sheets (or above them :-)) without hang-ups. Having confidence in yourself and knowing what you want will create that situation, not your body measurements, age, race, etc.

Sexually I am very open, meaning, very sex-positive. I like everything from sensual to ""porn-style"" sex. It all comes down to mood and the company I am keeping. It's really all about pleasing and being pleased. To me sex, if with the right person, is a fun and great adventure we can take... an opportunity to step away from normal life for a while and a way to feed all our senses. So ideally I would love to find someone with a similar mindset.

Beyond this, I will also add here that I am self-employed which means my time is very flexible so I am able to meet during the day as well as evenings. So I don't see any issues with finding the time to get together and hang out.

Hoping for some quality responses... let's see how it goes. :-) Please put ""SPECIAL FRIEND"" in the subject line so I know you're at least not some bot.

Thanks and hope to hear from you.

(Attached pic is not me but a good representation of what I'm like. Real pics once I hear back and realize there is potential.)

Hi there.
I am a very normal, down to earth masculine professional guy seeking a very pretty and 100% passable younger (18-29ish) ts for, dating, intimate fun, and or possible girlfriend. She must be very pretty, I prefer petite and short, but open to others. I tend to connect with a ts that has identified herself as a girl since a young age. I am a often told that I am very cute by very cute people:) I am a masculine and open minded white guy, with much younger looks I am often told. I am 5'8"", 150#, short brown hair, clean cut. I am very clean, healthy and of course 100% disease free and only seek the same. I am a very nice, polite, and respectful person. 

I love treating my girl very well in many ways. I am hoping to maybe find the impossible which is as I mention above, a very pretty passable ts that would like to have some fun, go on some dates, intimate encounters, overnights, and who know what else...hopefully more:) If this sounds interesting to you, please message me with pictures, interests, and any questions that you may have. 

Thanks

Hello. Thanks for checking out my posting. I have sought a true poly-amorous relationship most of my adult life, was in one, and and really want to again be in another with a super clean and classy couple. It does not have to be a live-in situation, but then again, that could be a nice option. I guess that would depend on preferences, logistics, and other variables on both sides. I am a normal, recently single, masculine, and educated white male. Younger looks I am often told, 5'7"", 155#, green eyes, decent shape, work out 4 days a week. I am very super clean and 100% disease free! Non drug user and don't smoke. Enjoy a few drinks on special occasions. I am very easygoing, polite, respectful, great sense of humor, and have a way of making others feel relaxed in many situations. I really like to treat a woman nice. I tend to be very passionate and romantic.

I am recently out of a long term (4 year) relationship, and although I am super selective, I have been anxious to hopefully stumble across a select couple to establish such a relationship with if all or at least most of the elements are there.

A few years ago, I had experiences with 2 different couples that I met at different places where they kind of picked me up you might say. Kind of a coincidence it has always seemed to me. I had repeat encounters with both couples, and they were awesome for all. One turned in to a poly type of relationship however I did not live with them. It was amazing! It was for approximately 11 months until they moved to San Diego. As I mention, I am just out of a long term relationship and I am ready to experience a true poly relationship if I can find that select couple or perhaps a single poly female.
I really like to treat a female well, and am a very passionate person. 

As a person, I am very responsible, clean, organized, and proud to handle all my household responsibilities.

In a poly relationship and in general, I am very non expectational, non possessive and again, I truly respect any and all limits and boundaries.

If you like what you hear, please feel free to get back to me with some pictures, and info about you, and what you seek, as well as any questions that you may have for me. I would be happy answer any questions you may have, as well as give you my number if it seems we may be a match. Either way thanks again for reading my posting:)

Thanks and cheers!

They should just change the name of this category from miscellaneous romance to married but looking.
What am I looking for, probably the same thing as you if you're reading this, what's been missing for too long. Romance or ? ? ? you can fill in the blanks since you're missing the same things. Let's get real about this though & let go of the fantasies, I'm married & hopefully you are too, there probably will not be weekend getaways to Tahiti or all of the things you read about in romance novels. I am very much a romantic but not at the cost of reality. We can have some wonderful times together, if we click, as long as you keep in mind the reality it's a discreet affair. How do we make this happen, hit reply & go from there. Neither of us knows where this is going until we meet over a cup of coffee, there is NO substitute for a face to face date. I am seeking that one woman that has the chemistry that works well with mine.

I'm not new to this I've had every type of woman you can imagine reply, I can usually tell the insincere immediately and don't respond, then there are some women who're able to lead me on for a short while before I realize they have no intention of ever meeting, but the most frustrating are the women who want to email on & on before meeting. I have figured these women out, they are the ones that despite having a 100 good reasons to get together they are secretly hoping that over weeks or even months of emailing they will get some kind of red flag, imagined or real, to give themselves an excuse to not meet. In other words they have no intention of ever meeting anybody no matter how perfect that person may be for them. I no longer deal with this type of woman it's too hard getting your hopes up just to be let down. This is why I will not stay interested if there is no face to face involvement after 2 or 3 emails & a couple of phone CONVERSATIONS not texts. All the emails in the world will not tells us as much as one coffee date.

This is not for sex (although I am open to the possibility) and will only take things as far as each of us are comfortable with each other. We can meet in public first. Perhaps watch a movie at one of our places as an excuse to get close to each other...I can travel or host. Open to something ongoing.

Hi, I am looking for someone to date and have some fun times. I am very honest and not looking for a hookup and would prefer to only be dating one person. The only caveat to my situation is I probably will be in San Jose for several more months and probably be moving on again even though I am still new to the area and don't know anyone. However, in the mean time, I would like to make the most of the situation.

For fun, I enjoy dining out, movies (in or out), card and board games, shorter (ie half day or less) hikes, playing ice hockey, sporting events, and would like to explore the area as well.

It is Friday night, Super Bowel this weekend in Santa Clara.

Trying to find a woman that is in a similar situation as myself...

Looking for fun afternoon and possibly occasional night get together where we enjoy each other and possibly if we have that right connection/chemistry and enjoy some extremely good sex!

-Day time availability. This is a priority. We may occasionally have nights or weekends open but weekdays is when we will spend most of our time together.
-34 to55 years old
-Thin to curvy body type but no BBW (sorry just not my type)
-Intelligent, good personality, sense of humor, easy going
-Disease and drug free
-Live within a hours drive, the most, of Morgan Hill/Gilroy for our considered driving times

Relaxed, not easily slighted, quick wit and sense of humor. Middle-aged, fit, healthy, handsome, Caucasian. If this sounds interesting please attach a photo, change the subject to something witty and include a little bit about yourself.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/msr/5397661445.html,Are You A Girl With A BBC Desire/Curious? Shy? Read On... - m4w,"
I am looking to meet a woman between the ages of 21 and 50 who wants to try a BBC (Big Black Cock) and have a cool guy like me to be there with you to watch the excitement and be your safe haven while you fulfill your deepest secret desires. I can be there so you will feel safe as I would imagine most women might be a bit nervous or shy to do this by themselves and I bet you would probably never try this on your own I did this once before with my ex and we walked around a swingers house and observed but towards the end we came across something sexy and amazing which we will both never forget and it only enriched our sex lives for many years. After the swingers house we went home and fucked like crazy. There are many possibilities here like going to a Swingers club or private house or put in an ad on CL to find a cool BBC or a couple where the guy is a very hung nice looking black stud.

So if your are into BBC (Big Black Cock) and maybe tried a black guy or two or if your a very curious girl who has secret desires and fantasies only you know you can trust me and we can share this fantasy together and privately.

After you read below you will understand where I get my excitement from and why I want to try this again.

My ex would get very wet and excited when we watched a porn that had a black guy with a huge cock with a white or Asian girl. She then started asking me about black cocks and if they all had big cocks and I said most do. She then wanted to see one in person so we went to Barry & Shell's in the Oakland Hills several years ago and walked around and came upon a black guy about 30 laying on his back and this really pretty white girl in her 20s was stroking his cock. I am not lying his cock was at least 10 to 12 inches long and almost as thick and long as my wife's wrist. We watched for about 10 minutes and my wife could not take her eyes off and he noticed this as there were others looking on too and his lady friend asked the several woman looking on if anyone wanted to finish jacking off her friend and she happened to be looking directly at my wife, my wife looked at me and I nodded yes and she sat down next to him and the other lady who was jacking him off grabbed my wife's hand and my wife kind of froze as there must have been 5 other couples watching, she guided my wife's hand onto his fully erect black cock and with her hand over my wife's hand she helped my wife for a few strokes and then she let go and my wife was now suddenly jacking off a strangers huge black cock. My wife's nipples were very hard and poking through her almost see through top. She had a short skirt on with panties and the guy pulled up her skirt and everyone saw her completely soaked white panties. He pulled her panties off as she continued stroking him. He then started fingering her bald wet Kitty and she then let out a slight moan and then she she kept nervously looking at me and she stroked his cock slowly for about 5 minutes seemingly enjoying every second, I noticed while she was stroking him she could not take her eyes of his huge cock but I did notice her gazing into his eyes a few times as she was jacking him off then with his urging she started jacking him off really fast and she knew he was about to cum and he finally shot 4 o 5 long ropes of thick white cum and I saw my wife kind of gulp and as he continued shooting cum her eyes never left his cock then entire time except when she looked at me a few times too see if I was okay with this all which I totally was, One of his shots of cum caught her in her face and the others missed but went straight up and then all over her hand and his cock and balls, She continued stroking him until he was semi hard and his cock was still 10 inches! She then got up and believe it or not everyone watching clapped, too funny. And we left a few minutes later and got in the car she asked me to feel her panties and they were soaked through. Wow.

She never sucked his huge cock but I now wish she would have while jacking him off. That would have been really hot.

She later said many times after that when we had sex she thought of this black guy.

I have always had this exciting fantasy of watching the girl I am with suck,stroke and fuck a nice looking fit and very hung black guy. The perfect scenario would be if he had a cute black,white,latina or Asian girl for me while he played with you. I am hoping for a White, Asian or Latina girl who craves or is curious about black men's long thick cocks. From what I hear a lot of woman secretly fantasize about black men. They are curious if they have never seen or had one. If you have already experienced a BBC its okay lets meet. If you have not that's even better. Again I am not gay, or bi or bi curious, I am totally straight but think it will be really hot to see my partner pull the underwear down of a hung black guy and see her eyes get big and see her smile big and get soaked panties when she sees how big the guy is and what she is about to do. Is there any lady out there wanting to do this with me? A one time encounter is okay but I would love to have an ongoing relationship so you can you can get your deserved share of BBC. From what I know many very hung black men are great lovers and have a ton of fucking stamina and stay hard and can fuck without cumming for long periods of time. The skin contrast thing is very exotic where a white woman or fair skinned woman white, Asian or Hispanic against a black man. I've seen this in adult films and read how much of a turn on this sight and thought can be when you see a hung fit black man on top of a light skinned woman fucking her deep and hard. Its really hot. 

If this fantasy does happen I in turn get to get totally turned on watching this and if I am lucky have a girl there for me to play with or if you and your black lover want me to participate I can, that way you can have the best of both worlds, black and white together.

Like I mentioned earlier I can be your safe haven as you may be a bit nervous to try this especially by yourself with a stranger. I think most girls wanting to try a BBC are to shy and nervous to do this by themselves and do not know any guy like me that they can trust and tell there taboo deep desires too. So this can be perfect for you and I.

To me the thought of a stranger is even more appealing and hot. Someone either of us does not know, of course we would screen the guy first and either both of us or just myself can meet him initially to make sure he is a safe nice guy. Or we can just go for it and find a cool guy and talk and text with him on the phone and then meet up. There are many scenarios but I just want to make sure you feel safe with me being there to make it a memorable fun hot erotic experience. I am totally fine with you and I getting to know each other and talking more about this fantasy before trying it if you want or we can talk a bit and meet and get right down to it.

I am white, 47 and I am tall and 195 lbs. I am a great looking guy who is totally straight.
If your interested email me back here. If your a cute lady, 21 to 49 and ready to do this reply back to me.
Once you email me back we can exchange pictures and phone numbers and meet up to talk more and set something up to meet up with a hung black guy or another couple or do a swingers club where there is an interracial tone.

I would love to meet a woman today who is 45 years or older for a friendship and hopefully an ongoing sexual relationship. Nothing serious but just a good old fashion friendship and great sex. Or this can be a one time discreet fun encounter. 

Maybe its been a long while since you had great sex, like me its been a while and I am quite lonely for the special touch and feel of a woman. We can meet for a cup of coffee first if you feel more comfortable or if you want to just have me come over that's fine too.

Are there any mature women out there who want to meet a guy and become friends and have some really great sex when we can meet up? Just a want to have a new friend and enjoy some really awesome sex together. Is that so bad? So if your serious about doing this lets talk and meet and have some fun.

If you wanted a one or two time encounter that's okay too. I am 47, white and over 6 ft tall and 200 lbs and nice looking.

I am very attracted to women older than me. So if your 45 to 65 lets meet up. You can email me back here and we can then exchange phone numbers and pictures.

There must be a lonely, bored woman somewhere in the East bay area who misses the touch and feel of a guy and misses great sex. I love to kiss and love foreplay and am well endowed and love to give oral sex and am good at it. I love to please.

Love nipples and breast play. So don't be shy, call me. I am open to all races and body types. We can exchange pictures once you email me through the ad. I will email you right back. I prefer not to post my picture on the internet so lets trade once we talk. Or email your number and I can call you. Again, be local to the East bay area. I am a fun down to earth nice guy.

I can travel but cannot host. Fairly flexible schedule with a little planning. 
Can trade pictures if you send one first. Looking forward to making new friends. 

Thanks and hope to hear from good people.

Now I am looking for a new stud for my queen. I am her bitch and she likes a dominant man, so you will pretty much make up all the rules.

The only issue is really scheduling. She works a job that involves travel pretty much during the week. So it would need to be Friday night or Saturday or early Sunday.

What to expect: We will spend few minutes to get acquainted, Then I will have you change and put on bath rope,

your inner thighs and kissing on you and playing softly with clit, licking on you slowly stroking my tongoe up and down your pussy
sometimes sofly licking on your ass. I have couple small vibratoing toys for your clit and your G-spot. I can make you cumm so hard your pussy will start to quiver uncontrollable.
softly on you drive you crazy and get you to trembling. Then let you relax for short time.
I will not do anything that you are not comfortable with, But I will push a button now and then. 
Some guys like to eat pussy, Me I enjoy the feeling of a woman Cumming, her body tensing up and the uncontrollable trembling she goes through 
as you are Cumming I lapping up her sweet juices. Race or age is not an issue (must be 18) And clean, I am ddf free and expect the same.
I know I'm a old gentle man then most of the ladies that need my service, But I can make you cream and scream like never before. 
I enjoy petite to small BBW.

I am totally straight never been with a guy, but t girls turn me on.

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have someone else do all
the work for you and just sit back and relax while you cum over and over.

I have thought about it a lot, and not so much about me personally, but others as well.

Here are my thoughts on the matter. We could meet first to see if you feel comfortable with me and
then go to your place and break out your favorite toys. I would then use your toys on you and play with your nipples while you relax. When done, I will leave, no reciprocation necessary. I will enjoy just
pleasing you. I don't care how you look or how much you weigh. Just be over 21, and enjoy sex.

Now if you read this far and this seems good to you, now I will give you my stats.

I'm sorry.?

I knew the attraction was mutual and I probably fell harder than you did but I held my tongue. No physical attachment, yet emotions ran rapid. I knew you wanted me to hold your hand on that bridge, but I was so insecure to think that someone as good and pure and whole as you would want me as a man. The anxiety associated with falling in love mixed with my fear of never falling in love froze me.?

Now all I'm left with is memories; the smile you gave me when I'd make SpongeBob impressions, both of us slouched over on the couch watching Netflix. We'd get so high and laugh at our lifestyles. We dreamt of being nomads, gypsies, free spirits.?

We haven't seen much of each other in a while, but we still consider each other close friends. I focused on my career; you moved back home, found someone else, and I couldn't be happier for you.?

But when I lay my head down at night all I can think about is giving up everything I worked for, everything I own, everything I possess just to get the chance to tell you that I don't want to live one more second without you by my side. I never stop thinking about you. I never stop hoping that good things happen to you. My body aches everyday at the thought that I'll never be with you.?

My heart will always be open to you, my first and only love.

When my eyes are locked with his
My lips are longing for his kiss
I feel a love I've never known
Yet my heart feels so alone
When our bodies are intertwined
And his hand is locked in mine
We're laying there cheek to cheek
Listening to our souls speak
We share our dreams, we share our fears
We're not afraid to shed our tears
We can cry and we can laugh
But we're burdened by our pasts
Jealousy begins to swell
Why can't happiness just prevail
Laughter always turns to anger
Our love is once again in danger
Good times don't ever seem to last
We can blame that on our past
Life has made us who we are
We never seem to get too far,
My soul will never really know
How to ever let you go
This love we have was unexpected
My heart is left unprotected,
I feel our paths were meant to cross
Before you, my soul was lost
Life's journey's leading me to you
I need us both to see this through,
I want a love that others envy
And a heart that isn't empty
I want you to cause my biggest smiles
Ones that can be seen for miles,
How can our story ever start
If we won't open up our hearts
I never want our love to end
You're my lover and my best friend,
I'm willing to work to make this last
Leaving our pasts in the past
Love builds from trust, honesty, and respect
I'll give it to you and it's what I'll expect,
So don't give up on what we have
Let's build it up and make it last
It'll be worth it, I promise you this
Our love is one that we would miss
My heart and soul are lost without you
Let's let love's destiny see us through
You're my soulmate, you were made for me
You're my heart's final destiny

I am craving you with the deepest depths of my belly. Starved of your touch, your smell, your taste. I am vibrating with a ravenous urge by the mere thought of you. The times we had together, years ago... The heat from our chemistry could take the wallpaper off this old Victorian flat. I don't know what I would do if you called me or if we crossed paths. I anticipate the moment being grander than words, just taking your face in my hands and hurriedly yet deliberately pressing your soft, sweet lips on mine. Firm pressure. A sailor coming back from war. I don't know if I would be able to take my hands off of you. Feeling your beautiful body, every. perfect. curve. Made for me to devour. I want to tear into you, bite the sexy ink on your chest, rip off your clothes and swallow you whole. A fit of fever. 
There are 4 more rings in our respective tree trunks since we last had any contact at all. Still fantasizing about our inexplicable physical compatibility. I wonder if you can feel me thinking of you...

I know you never really loved me back. You regretted ever saying it. You backpedaled. I see that now. I'm so ashamed of how hard I fell for you. I feel like I was completely delusional the whole time. I thought our conversations were actually a two way thing. I thought we were closer than we really were. I admit I was not at all expecting you to tell me I was talking to you too much. I thought you actually liked me and being friends with me. I believed you loved me. 

I hurt so much. Even now that I realize everything was so one-sided. Even after all these months of not hearing a single word from you... I feel like a complete fool. I am truly embarrassed for everything and I wish I had never let you in. I wish I could take it all back. I wish I wasn't still in love with you. 

I hope that confessing all of this will help me to move on because it's utterly stupid how much I wish you would come back. Every time my phone makes a noise some part of me hopes it is finally you. isn't that ridiculous? I know. But I know you won't be back. I know you never loved me at all. I know I know I know.

I don't get it! 

Being professional athletes, they are celebrities in their own right. That being the case, they have a fine selection of women that the rest of us mortal can only dream of, that they could have sex with - FOR FREE! So why the hell would they get themselves into trouble with the law and the NFL by messing around with skanky hookers? 

No hooker is worth that much! Look at those NFL players who were recently busted and will now lose out on the opportunity of a lifetime to play in Super Bowl. That shit is going to haunt them for the rest of their lives. What a disgrace. And it was completely unecessary as far as I can tell..

This is more true than ever. In this day and age of social media. It's easy to have fan pages set up, where women will throw themselves at you, whether you're a famous Hollywood actor or a professional athlete. If you're an NFL, you can even set up a booth somewhere to sign autographs, give out merchandise and yep, draw those crazy women that will sleep with a guy just because they're a celebrity or world class athlete. 

Not only that, if you and some other NFL team mates were to go to some strip club, or even regular night club, you know you would have women throwing themselves at all. They can take them all up to the VIP lounge and then back to the hotel.

So I don't get it. What is up with all of these NFL players getting caught up messing around with prostitutes? I simply don't get it. Anyone know why professional football players would do this and risk ruining their lucrative careers, when they have tons of women everywhere willing to satisfy them for free? Seriously, wtf!

Back in my younger days, people were not MORONS or IDIOTS, whenever you bought something, it's yours! None of this crap to try it for a month and return it if you don't like it!

It's your job to make sure what you are buying is what you want! How in the f_ck did you NOT know what size you need BEFORE you bought it??? Did your ass grow to a baloon since the last time you bought anything?

No business should refund to anyone because of you being stupid idiots! This store has the right idea! Make you responsible for you own idiocy! Mommy is no longer able to cuddle you and tell you how wonderful you are no matter how many times you screwed up! 

If they are overpriced, why did you buy anything? Another proof of how much of an IDIOT you are! How will you ever make it through life?

They don't need your type of customer because you are the reason they have a no refund policy. You can't be responsible for your own idiocy! Always blaming it on others, you are never at fault!


BTW, when any item is returned, California law say it cannot be re-sold as new!

This is REALITY!

(Did I make myself clear?)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OP:
Do NOT shop at this store !! First, they are way over priced, and second, they have a NO REFUND policy that they did not post a sign about in the store very conspicuously, and I bought a pair of medium sized sweat pants. They ended up being too small, so I just decided that I wanted my money back. They refused, citing their NO refund policy, so now I was forced to buy something else that I really did not want !! If the NO REFUND policy sign was more conspicuous, I would have NOTHING to say, but in this case, I feel I got totally ripped off. 

They also said that their NO refund policy is on their receipts, but by the time I get my receipt, they already have my money, so by then it is too late to do anything about it !!!!

BUYER BEWARE !!! Once this place takes your money....they keep it !!! And it is so funny actually that the staff got all pushed out of shaped and acted like they were offended and surprised that I would dare ask for my money back.
To me, this is not a good way to treat customers. Here in town, all three CVS, Walgreens and Target give full refunds on all purchases, even if the package is opened. There should be NO reason this store can't do the same thing!!

NORCAL SPORTSWEAR......Shame on you !!!

bye bye bye


1) Tumblr is dying. 

Of course, a dinosaur like Yahoo would swoop this up for $1 billion dollars. The immature little prick owner is laughing all the way to the bank. Yahoo = SUCKERS.

Yeah, it's shear genius to create ANOTHER blogging site when blogging sites are going down hill because people are turning toward smartphone usage. Blogging sites are going, going, soon to be gone...Blogging is so 2003.

2) WordPress - another blogging dinosaur. Toni won't be able to finance his hack wife's 'artistic' endeavors for much longer. Maybe he can sell used cars in the future.

What percentage of WordPress sites have been utterly abandoned? 

Some estimate over 70%. But WordPress loves using blackhat strategies to make sure the sites still pop up even if a person hasn't added anything in 5 years.

The genius Google engineers haven't learned this yet? (or they don't feel like fixing their search engine?)

In 3 - 5 years it will be a mom-and-pop operation. Yeah I wanna read the blog of my oh so ingenious neighbor as he talks about his tomatoes. Right. Basically malicious people use WordPress to harass people they don't like because the staff at WordPress is brain-dead and couldn't get jobs at Google. 

Send a TOS complaint to WordPress - you get a standard response from a flunkie who is still living in his mother's basement.

3) Reddit - what happens when a corporation buys a cool site? 

It goes down the toilet. 

Monitors look at anything that is posted and quash what they don't like. The censors can also count on the 24/7 flunkies who are there to vote up the most STUPID shit and vote down anything controversial or thought-provoking.

All 3 sites will be gone within 5 years.

To the person below, I totally agree with what you had to say. That guy referred to as Veggie, Veg, Veggienut etc. has NEVER taken meds for his mental condition and absolutely refuses to do so. That's because first of all, he's in denial of the fact that he's suffering from any sort of mental disorder. Obviously, he's not all there. He needs to go see a psychologist.

Secondly, even if he knew he was all fucked up in the head, he's said point blank past posts that he refuses to take any of ""Big Pharma's"" prescription medicines. So if he gets sick, he'd rather drop dead than take some prescription drug that could save his life. That guy is cookoo for sure! 

And regarding what he wants from ""R"", yeah, it would be completely pointless for ""R"" to answer that clearly deranged guy's questions. They're bullshit questions, NOT genuinely sincere requests for information. And like you said OP, no matter what answer ""R"" gives to the Veg guy's questions, he'll use the answer as something to fire back at ""R"". It would be some bullshit rebuttal along with vulgar name calling.

All that nutcase simply wants is free verbal material from ""R"" that he can use to harrass ""R"" further. That's it. Nothing more. And if ""R"" is reading this, please don't give in to that no-life Veggie freak. Continue to ignore his questions, please. He doesn't deserve any answers from you. 

To recap, that asshole Veggie doesn't want ""answers"". He's lying. All he wants is to do is use any responses you give him, against you. It's all bullshit. Don't play his game.

You have for a LONG time been obsessed with this R person and you are trying to provoke him to answering some fucking dumb ass question(s) that the answers would be of absolutely NO consequence to ANYONE, and if R did answer your questions, you no doubt would fire back some kind of response telling all of us how much you find wrong about his answers no matter what he says. Did you ever think that he is not answering you because he is not interested in debating with you over absolutely NOTHING that is truly important.

You must find a way to realize that rants & raves is a place for EVERYONE to say whatever they want about ANY topic at all. But boy, R has really gotten under your skin by not answering you. It sounds by your posting that his refusal to answer you is pure torture for you !!!! All your posts make it seem like you are Bipolar and off your medications and acting out !!

So......WHY is it so fucking important that he answer you ? To be honest, you are only serving to make a complete and total fool of yourself by your constant badgering of R

By the way, in the past, I have had my own email conversations with R and to be very honest, he is actually a really nice guy. No matter how hard you try, his faith in God will ALWAYS make him stronger than you, no matter what you say !!!!

So, leave the guy the fuck alone and find something else more productive to do with your time.... I'll bet your sitting at your computer most of the day & night posting message after message trying to provoke R, and as you can tell, you are NOT successful and will never be !!!!!

Turn off your fucking computer and give it a rest man !!! All of us on rants & raves are sick and tired of all your bullshit !!!!!!!!!! We can ALL see right through you for who (and what) you really are...pure evil !!!!!!

OK people.....now just hold on a second here !!!! First, I am a proud white man, age 51. I am also disabled, and my caregiver is a very nice, sweet black woman who works very hard to make my life easier each day !!! Yes, it might be true that several black people tend to do things that the rest of us do not approve of, but to me, it is not because they are black, but it has to do with what kind of family support system they have, meaning that I think that most black men who find themselves in trouble do not have a good father figure in their life to give them good direction. But I for one think it is totally wrong to categorize ALL blacks as behaving badly. That is simply NOT true !!! I know LOTS of really great black men and women who despite their culture have ended up being really fantastic people !!

As far as Denny's requiring blacks to pre-pay, that is totally wrong.....but if they require EVERYONE to pre-pay, then in my mind that would be OK since I do understand why they are asking for pre-payment....But to discriminate against a single race of people is WRONG no matter what race they are !!

I say it is wrong to judge others no matter who they are or what color they are, or if they are disabled or whatever. I am disabled myself so I guess for me, I find it easier to just take people as they are.

Do NOT shop at this store !! First, they are way over priced, and second, they have a NO REFUND policy that they did not post a sign about in the store very conspicuously, and I bought a pair of medium sized sweat pants. They ended up being too small, so I just decided that I wanted my money back. They refused, citing their NO refund policy, so now I was forced to buy something else that I really did not want !! If the NO REFUND policy sign was more conspicuous, I would have NOTHING to say, but in this case, I feel I got totally ripped off. 

They also said that their NO refund policy is on their receipts, but by the time I get my receipt, they already have my money, so by then it is too late to do anything about it !!!!

BUYER BEWARE !!! Once this place takes your money....they keep it !!! And it is so funny actually that the staff got all pushed out of shaped and acted like they were offended and surprised that I would dare ask for my money back.
To me, this is not a good way to treat customers. Here in town, all three CVS, Walgreens and Target give full refunds on all purchases, even if the package is opened. There should be NO reason this store can't do the same thing!!

The inauguration comes weeks after Brazil rejected Israel's ambassador, a former leader of West Bank settlers. 

The Palestinian Authority inaugurated its first embassy in the Western Hemisphere in Brasilia Wednesday amid a diplomatic row between Brazil and Israel.

Representatives of Arab countries and Arab Brazilians attended the event, hosted on land donated to the PA by former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

""This is the conclusion of a dream of mine that was also a dream of colleagues that came before me in this mission in the last four decades,"" said Palestinian ambassador Ibrahim Alzeben. ""I hope that this is the beginning of a new phase in relations between Brazil and Palestine, that they can be closer and more diversified."" 

The Brazilian government -- long openly supportive of Palestine -- last month rejected Israel's appointment for envoy, a former leader of West Bank settlers who are illegally occupying Palestinian land. The announcement came a year after the previous envoy was sent and without prior communication with the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. Palestinian diplomats lobbied against Israel's pick and Israel has refused to select another, chilling relations with Brazil.

The Palestine Liberation Organization has sent representatives to Brazil since 1975, and a special delegation has served as de facto embassy staff since 1998. Alzeben expressed his hope for a Brazilian embassy in Jerusalem during the ceremony; it already has one in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Alzeben said he also hopes to secure a free-trade agreement with countries of Mercosur, the South American trade bloc. Israel signed a Free Trade Zone Agreement with Mercosur in 2007 and Brazil is its largest partner in Latin America.

2) Jews represent less than 2% of the US population and less than 1% of the world. Are you so fucking stupid as to believe in their out sized influence in banking and journalism? I guess you are.

3) Judaism is first and foremost a RELIGON not a race. Not all Christians are white, not all Muslims are Arabic and not all Buddhists are Asian.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/rnr/5437224792.html,Intimidation through nightly 'settler-tour',"
On Saturday, 30th January 2016, large groups of settlers, accompanied by heavily-armed soldiers, entered the Palestinian market at night and took it over for about an hour during night-time in occupied al-Khalil (Hebron).

Around 9:30 pm, Israeli settlers from the illegal settlements throughout al-Khalil gathered at Bab al-Baladiyya, from where they walked into the Palestinian souq, the market, surrounded by heavily-armed Israeli forces. The group of more than 50 settlers started a 'tour' of the Palestinian market, with Israeli forces 'guarding' them throughout the Palestinian market. Palestinian residents were not allowed to pass and forced to wait at a distance, with soldiers repeatedly pointing the lasers from their guns at them to indicate they have to stop. A walk home at night though, for some Palestinians took almost an hour, instead of the usual 10 minutes.

This kind of 'settler tour' through the Palestinian market used to take place regularly on Saturday afternoons. During the 'tour' Palestinians are often denied to pass, stopped, ID-checked and detained. In the recent months, no 'settler tours' took place, but last week they started again with a nightly-tour at 11pm. For the Palestinian residents of the souq, these tours have become a regular form of intimidation and harassment in the past.


(The REAL reason for the 'tour': the Israelis have embedded microphones and concealed cameras in the walls and buildings of the Palestinian quarter. In this manner they can monitor conversations and movements even when the Palestinians think there are no Israelis around.

The data is downloaded from the spy equipment by wireless methods that require that the operatives be in close proximity to the devices.

The Israelis have shifted their collection operations to after dark, because the Palestinians have begun deploying concealed electronic monitoring equipment as well, and the Israelis are on the defensive, now, trying to keep the Palestinians from seeing where the Israelis concealed their spying equipment.

The Israelis are old hands at using mobbing behavior to conceal operations and assassinations and robberies. This is just more of the same.)

We have talk about Asian women and infect some of my friends have fuck some Asian but no because they are better than white women but because we wanted to fuck and know what is like it and most of us have paid to them (Where at the massage parlors) Most Asian that I know are in the business of massage and 99%.9 are prostitutes but they do not agree with that.

I went to a massage place last week and this young Asian tells me come in my honey, you good looking man she said then we are in the massage table and she asked me if I want something else -like what I ask- she said a better massage to make you happy. To tell you she was just sling but a natural sling no ass , no tits, and really scary so I told her with how many men you do this- she said my honey only with you. Be-careful with these women Asian who are in this business you can get very ill.

White women are better than these so sling slanted eyes and they are no greedy. These Asian Noodle and Noodle and noodle and smell like garlic. Philippines are the ugliest women between Asian women. 
I will never change my white women for these kind of women unless I find an educated Asian. Most Asians in the massage business are Chinese and Vietnamese. And my full respect for Japanese- Japanese women are sexy, clean and well educated and they do not fuck for money because they are rich.

To the OP, 

I would like to help, but after working the long hours that I do to pay my rent, I don't have the time or energy to be on ""neighborhood patrol"" tracking down those section 8 renters. Shit! I wish I could qualify for section 8 housing myself. The rents around here are ridiculous and continue to increase. 

I can't wait until the market crashes again. It has to. These unreasonable rent increases can't go on forever. A market crash is a market adjustment. This is good for regular responsible people like me who are struggling already as it is paying high rents. 

The greedy landlords who keep jacking up the rents are just as bad, in my opinion, as the typically lowlife people that don't deserve but are able to get section 8 housing. How about a program for reduced rent for those of us who work hard every work and don't milk the system? I never collect food stamps, welfare or all of the other ""free shit"" all the lazy fucks who don't want to work freely collect. 

Actually, forget about reducing my rent. I would just be happy if the damn rent wouldn't rise more than the overall rate of inflation. I think that's totally fair. I'm not saying no rent increases, but a reasonably fair amount. As the overall cost of living goes up, likewise by the same proportion, should go the rent. 

I'm a reasonable guy. But landlords in municipalities where rent control doesn't exist can literally double the rent if they wanted to. And that's 100% legal. But just because something is legal to do that doesn't make it right. Those greedy ass landlords are just as fucked up as the section 8 people who never get off their ass to improve their lives so that other down and out people can have a chance to get the help that section 8 offers for those who really, no bullshit, need it.

I am so glad that you cleared that up for everybody. Some little girls may like that, but smart women know better and apparently, you have yet to met any. 

OP:

A man is looked at as being ""creepy"" by many women (glen par (south san francisco)

It's because women, despite what they say, don't want nice guys because nice guys are boring. For some really stupid reason, (Freud couldn't figure it out either), women want the bad boy. Then they complain about how badly the bad boy treats them. (I believe they simply want some excitement in their lives, then complain when they get too much excitement.) Let's face it, women, in general, don't know what they want, but we, the men, are supposed to read their minds and know what they want. How in the hell are we supposed to know when the women themselves don't know what they want. And so goes the eternal battle between men and women.

Yeah, many of them consider criminal, rude, selfish behavior to be acceptable, thus normal, thus desirable. Monkey see, Monkey do. Some of these kids grow up seeing their parents and other adults around them behaving like criminals, and so they think it's ""normal"". Then they get all bent out of shape when they are caught and claim ""racism"". Yet they call each other ""nigga"" and refer to other Blacks as ""female/male"" like animals.

RE:re Denny's requiring Blacks to pre-pay (oakland east) 
That's because criminal and uncivilized behavior is normal to black's and they are unable to recognize it.
------------------------------------------------
You're all such crackers out here I just don't trust that anything you say has validity.
You folks are fuckin' weird.

Denny's requiring Blacks to pre-pay
This is a pretty smart move. Anyone who's been to a Denny's in the Bay Area knows that the customers most likely to try to leave without paying are...you know. I was at the one in Emeryville a few years ago, only place around open at 03:00, and in the hour we were there there were at least 3 instances of waitresses having to stop you-know-who from walking out before they paid.

It's sad that the rest of us have to suffer; show receipts when leaving stores, having to walk past armed guards at DOLLAR STORES, having to pay public employees to pick up all the trash and half eaten fast food thrown on the street, and all the rest that comes with having a sizable Black population.

A OPEN LETTER TO ALL SAN FRANCISCANS
San Francisco is no Sanctuary City for a 37 yr. tax paying, small business resident of San Francisco illegally evicted. I am a mortgage fraud, illegal foreclosure (in writing by Wells Fargo) and illegal eviction (of my home/office of 27 yrs.) CRIME VICTIM. I had two hand guns and 800 rounds of ammo (amongst other things) stolen in spite of pleading with the evicting SF Sheriffs to put my Firearms in their holding area they use for domestic abuse cases. I had 38 hrs. of verified notice of eviction after being LIED TO BY the SF Sheriff's supervisor of evictions. SF Fraud Investigator Yee ""never even opened my box"". I was contacted by SFDA Taylor as a favor for 25 yr. veteran SFDA Kopel who's ""lady friend"" was connected to my squatter room mate, who a SFPD later told me he ""busted for meth sales behind Safeway"". SFDA Kopel's ""lady friend"" tried to shake me down for half my house in return for the arrest/conviction of X-Steeler, All Pro, Paul Lopata (who uses his NFL experience to present himself as a legit mortgage broker) the writer of the Equity Line of Credit (that was stolen by forgery), return of my retirement property, the other half of my house and a non returnable $2,200 (she was ""so sure"" of herself). Taylor quickly lost my complete submission twice. She also sent me back to SF Fraud Dept. and ""crackerjack fraud investigator McPherson did nothing but fingerprint me. I submitted copies of San Francisco recorded documents with my name forged as CEO of Oak Financial the partner lender of Lopat's Equity Lenders for the equity line of credit along with all of my attorney's investigative work and NOTHING WAS DONE. Mayor Lee has locked me out of his office sending security out to take my paperwork and stamp my copy ""Received"". My representative Nancy Pelosi ""does not get involved law enforcement issues"" by email, but has no problem sending our BRAVE to die fighting foriegn corruption.. Attorney General Harris got her job at the SFDA's office by dating Willie Brown and was trained by Kopel.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/rnr/5437095654.html,"16-year-old charged in murder of Hoover husband, father, Iraq war vet","
A Bessemer teen is charged with murder in the shooting death of a Mike Gilotti, a 33-year-old husband, father and Iraq war veteran.

Just 10 days after the killing, Hoover police announced charges against 16-year-old Charleston Everett Wells.

He is currently in the Tuscaloosa County Jail on charges related to a stolen Ford F-250 pickup and several car break-ins and is awaiting transfer back to Jefferson County.

A murder warrant against the teen, who up until recently attended Bessemer City High School, was signed just after 10 a.m. today and Wells' arrest was announced this afternoon in a joint press conference held by The Hoover Police Department and The Jefferson County District Attorney's Office in Bessemer.

Wells was arrested in Bessemer on Wednesday by the U.S. Marshals Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force. He has been charged as an adult and will be held without bail on the murder warrant.

Wells is just one of several suspects, authorities said, and they are not yet saying Wells pulled the trigger. Three others, including two juveniles, are in custody on other charges.

""Since this terrible crime occurred, this has been the top priority of the Hoover Police Department,'' said Hoover Police Chief Nick Derzis. ""From the beginning, we said we were going to do whatever it takes to solve it and hold those responsible accountable for their actions.""

""A lot of work has been done so far, and I'm extremely proud of the support shown by the Hoover community and all our partner agencies,'' Derzis said. ""We will continue to place all of our focus and efforts on this case until all that were involved are locked away where they belong.""

""These groups of predators, whether they're gang members, wannabe gang members, or just individuals robbing and shooting people, when you can't go get a cheeseburger, or come out of your house to go work out without getting robbed or shot, it seems to me they have declared war on us,'' said Bessemer Cutoff Chief Assistant District Attorney Bill Veitch. ""We're declaring war on them.

We're going to prosecute these crimes like our lives depend on it, because they do,'' Veitch said.

In all, 15 law enforcement agencies assisted with the investigation, including the Bessemer Police Department, Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's Office, The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, The Jefferson County District Attorney's Office (Bessemer Division) and the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force. 

Hoover police Capt. Gregg Rector said Wells' arrest is just the first step. ""We still have a way to go on this case. We said from the beginning we were determined to find justice, he said.

Rector held up photos of Gilotti while he spoke, emotional at times. ""While I'm heaping praise on some of these law enforcement agencies, this is the reason we're here today,'' he said. ""This is Mike Gilotti, Iraqi war veteran. Mike Gilotti, 33-years-old, was minding his own business. He's a hard working guy, he's got a family, two small boys.

He's getting up early to work out and then go to his job. He runs into a group of car burglars who instead of running and fleeing, as you would expect thieves to do, these individuals obviously turned on him, shot him. He dies in front of his house and we're determined to seek justice for Mile Gilotti's wife, for his kids, and for his entire family. Justice means when each and every one of the people involved in this crime is behind bars.""

Investigators said several possible suspect names emerged very early in the investigation and it became apparent all of them had ties to the Bessemer area. Law enforcement agencies throughout the Birmingham area have recovered four stolen vehicles in the past 10 days, all affiliated with the group of suspects. The group is being investigated for their involvement in crimes in other cities.

The suspects range in age from 16 to 20. ""Sadly it's not anything new to us. We're seeing young people committing acts of violence,'' Rector said. ""You don't have to look far, you see kids committing acts of violence all the time.""

Rector said the other suspects in the case are jailed in various jurisdictions in the Birmingham area. ""They are certainly high on our suspect list for this crime,'' he said.

The U.S. Marshal's Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force arrested Wells in Bessemer while he was in a vehicle. He was taken into custody without incident. ""I can't give Bessemer PD enough credit,'' Rector said. ""They have been phenomenal.""

Of the suspects, Rector said this: ""These young people may be gang-related, I would call them common street criminals,'' he said. ""These are criminals who steal cars, this is what they do. They steal cars. They break into cars. They use drugs. They sell drugs. It's their lifestyle. It's what they do. In this case they obviously took it one step further and we're not going to stand for it. We're not going to tolerate it until all of them are brought to justice.""

Of Wells' arrest, he said, ""I hope it sends a message to others involved in this case that they're next.""

Cops to killers of Hoover man: 'It's time to worry'

Gilotti was shot to death about 4:55 a.m. on Jan. 5 just outside his home in the 5500 block of Park Side Circle in Hoover's Lake Cyrus subdivision. He was heading to the gym for a morning workout when police say he encountered one or more suspects breaking into his car. One shot was fired, and Gilotti collapsed on his doorstep. He was later pronounced dead on the scene.

The investigation has been the Hoover Police Department's top priority since Gilotti's slaying.

Home surveillance video obtained from a neighbor gave investigators a vehicle description and, just six hours after the killing, Bessemer police were notified of an abandoned truck near the intersection of Roland Avenue and Elmore Street near the Jonesboro and Burstall communities. It was the older Ford F-250 pickup seen leaving the Lake Cyrus area very close to the time of the shooting.

At that time, police said four unknown black male suspects were seen walking away from the truck and getting into a dark colored Jeep Cherokee. Hoover police Capt. Gregg Rector has said the abandoned Ford F-250 was stolen late the previous night in a residential area of Tuscaloosa County.

There were also multiple vehicle break-ins reported in the same area where the truck was stolen. These crimes occurred in the Alabama Highway 69 / Inverness area of Tuscaloosa County. It appears the suspects committed these crimes earlier in the night, prior to coming to Hoover.

On Jan. 8, Rector released photos of two of the men wanted for questioning in Gilotti's death.

The photos were taken after the suspects left the Tuscaloosa area, and just prior to them returning to the Bessemer/ Hoover area. One of the young men, wearing a dark-colored hoodie with ""FLY"" on the front, was believed to be a 19-year-old who attended Bessemer City High School. Rector said today Wells was, indeed, in those photos.

Authorities said he was known to frequent the McCalla / Tannehill area, as well as Arlington Avenue and Roosevelt Park areas in Bessemer.

Rector at that time also had strong words for the killer or killers: ""For the suspects involved in this crime, it's time to worry, and it's time to be concerned about what the next few days may bring,'' Rector said.

""It's also time to think long and hard about the exact role they played in this murder. I think it's safe to say that one of them has more to worry about than the others. We have a very clear goal that we're working toward and we're not stopping until we get it.""

Gilotti served as a U.S. Army tank commander, first lieutenant and platoon leader in the 12th Cavalry Regiment. An Avon, Connecticut native, Gilotti worked at the State Farm claims office on Lakeshore Parkway. He and his wife had two young sons, ages 5 and 1.

Co-workers said they were not authorized to speak about Gilotti but said the entire office is devastated. ""Our hearts go out to his family, friends, and coworkers and he will be greatly missed,"" said State Farm spokesman Roszell Gadson.

His wife of eight years, Heather, heard the shot and called 911. His two young sons, Russell and Kevin, were inside the home.

Gilotti's funeral was held on Sunday, Jan. 10, and hundreds of people stood along Alabama 150 to pay their respects. Hoover police escorted Gilotti's family from their Lake Cyrus home to Riverchase United Methodist Church.

Hoover police investigated five homicides in 2015. The city has had 21 murders over the past 10 years, and hasn't had an unsolved murder since 2004.

Rector acknowledged the concern in the community following Gilotti's slaying.

""It would certainly be nice if I could say this is not going to happen in your neighborhood, this is not going to happen in Hoover, this is not going to happen in Vestavia, but that's certainly not something we can say,'' Rector said. ""Mike Gilotti lived in a very nice neighborhood, he had a good job, drove nice cars. To me, I look at Mike Gilotti as someone who is living the American Dream. He's got a wife, he's a decorated war veteran and if this can happen in Mike Gilotti's neighborhood then it certainly has the potential to happen anywhere.""

""It's just a sign of the times,'' he said. ""We're seeing a lot of violent people committing terrible crimes and this is just one example of those crimes.""

A man with autism has been sentenced for the murder of a 58-year-old man during a brutal attack inside a Walgreens in East Hartford.

According to the Hartford Courant, Anthony Henry has autism and was sentenced to 20 years with the state Psychiatric Security Review Board after being found not guilty by reason of mental defect. 

Police said Henry, 24, and Robert Boulay, 58, both of East Hartford, were both shopping at the Walgreens at 20 Connecticut Boulevard in East Hartford on Aug. 3 when they got into an argument inside the store.

Then the fight turned physical and Henry punched Boulay in the face, then either kicked his head or stomped on it as many as 15 to 20 times, police said.

When police arrested Henry shortly after the assault, he was initially charged with assault in the first degree and breach of peace, police said.

On Aug. 8, Boulay died at the hospital from the head injuries he sustained during the assault and police added a first-degree murder charge to the list of charges against Henry.

Henry was found not guilty by reason of insanity, according to the Hartford Superior Court clerk's office.

I'm a twentysomething woman living and working in San Francisco, and I really love being catcalled.

I love being told that catcalling doesn't exist. That it's something women say happens to them to get attention. That women who are in their 20s should feel appreciative and be thankful that a man would take the time out of his day to offer his opinion of them. That as a woman ages well into her 30s and 40s and beyond, she will no longer be considered beautiful, and will wish for youth and wish that men will take notice of her, by catcalling or otherwise.

I love that women exist for the pleasure and amusement of men, including but not limited to posing for sexualized magazine covers and wearing scanty outfits in movies. I like that women can be ""housewives"" and ""trophy wives,"" as opposed to being classified purely as wives. I like that women should be valued for their beauty and not their brains, be taken at superficial value and not at the true inner, complicated depths that exist beneath the make-up and blush, the Burberry and chic. I like knowing that if I ever make it in any industry, I will still face sexism and will need the guidance and support of men in that industry in order to be heard, appreciated and taken seriously.

I love that men determine when in my life I can be considered attractive and when in my life I should give up and let the ship of beauty and youth set sail. I like being told that I should smile, as if I'm an animal being given a command, and the treat is to please the catcaller. I like that my purpose as a woman walking on a street is to make men happy, whether I smile or tell them to have a good day or engage in any sort of conversation.

I enjoy my morning commute being peppered with unnecessary intrusions into my everyday life. It's nice balancing my budget and planning my day ahead while figuring out which comeback to say at a specified time. It means I'm good at multi-tasking.

I like the fear that manifests itself as I debate which route I should take to go home at night, whether it's safe enough to hail a taxi or if I could brave the subway and the catcalls that will inevitably follow as I'm wearing a party dress and heels. I like that men think that I'm dressing up for their pleasure, when I'm actually dressing up for myself.

I like that people think I can't tell the difference between a catcall and a genuine compliment. I enjoy being told to just brush it off, to ignore it, to deal with it -- even though the dangers of catcalling make themselves apparent again and again and again and again.

I like having my opinions brushed aside. I like feeling that my thoughts don't matter, that I'm only a body. I like being told that I'm just exaggerating, that I'm nagging about something that doesn't exist, that I'm crazy. I like being ridiculed and scolded. I like being put in my place. I like when people tell me that because they don't see someone being catcalled, it must not happen. I like having to be motherly when it is necessary in any setting, and I like that when I'm being forward and giving an opinion, I'm being a bitch.

I like the fact that I feel like I need a man to help validate my thoughts, as if I couldn't have been taken seriously on my own.

I like wondering if we'll ever achieve equality.

I like knowing that people think we already have, even when we haven't.

I like that I'm a woman and I'm living in a man's world.

I like knowing that it will never change.

*****************

Couldn't agree more. I dated this one girl who was all over the place emotionally. When I was nice she wanted to fight. So I was aloof with her. Never called, never bought her flowers, picked fights. She would call crying ""why don't you ever call me?"" One day I flat out told her if I was nice to her she would have no interest in me. She agreed with that statement.

I was able to keep that alive and exciting for 4 years until she needed to have a baby. That's when I let her go.

Re: RE: A man is looked at as being ""creepy"" by many women (glen par (south san francisco) 
It's because women, despite what they say, don't want nice guys because nice guys are boring. For some really stupid reason, (Freud couldn't figure it out either), women want the bad boy. Then they complain about how badly the bad boy treats them. (I believe they simply want some excitement in their lives, then complain when they get too much excitement.) Let's face it, women, in general, don't know what they want, but we, the men, are supposed to read their minds and know what they want. How in the hell are we supposed to know when the women themselves don't know what they want. And so goes the eternal battle between men and women.

It is EXTREMELY obvious that I (""R"") did not write this. It is written by one that is POSSESSED by Satan.......namely the one known as Veginut. Although Satan has this man wrapped around his finger, saying the most ungodly things imaginable, God also has His purpose in allowing such evil to temporarily exist.

Why, you might ask?!

The Lord wants everyone to see the evil of one who not only does not believe in Him, but of the ugliness of one's heart, who fights against Him! Why is the Veg, so OBSESSED with my posts?

For the same reason, Satan hates Christ!

I have been declaring Christ's salvation for over a decade, and attempting to make the readers realize, that how we think and how we conduct ourselves in this life, is the very scale of judgment which the Lord will judge us by.

It doesn't matter if the Veg believes in Jesus or not.......he has blasphemed the Lord in the most disgusting way possible, and I wouldn't be in his shoes for all the world!!!

I have prayed for this man (more than once), and when I told him so (in a post), he cussed and cursed at me like never before, to prove just how little my prayers had an effect upon him! It reminded me of the Exorcist demon, when Holy water was sprinkled on him.

I do not pray for him any longer, for I realize it is like praying that the devil would worship Jesus and return to his heavenly place.

I know you are reading this, Veg.............I pity you in soooooooooo many ways, for all that you are doing is creating your own hellish destiny. What really amazes me, is your thinking I have to answer to you! 

Ha! That will be the day! This post is my answer to you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I answer to only ONE..........unlike you, who obviously answers to and serves evil, like no other!

Compared to the anti-Christ, you are small potatoes, but you are still an anti-Christ, insofar as you are demon possessed, feebly trying to dissuade others from their rightful inheritance of salvation. When the devil recruited you, he was resorting to using the bottom of the barrel.

But no matter how many times you post your evil, it will NEVER affect me in the way you hope... for I know who I am, and so does the Lord. Ridicule or vote me off?!?! Ha...You cannot even slow me down, let alone, stop me.

For you have little or no idea of the POWER you fight against.......and it's NOT the Illuminati, the Pope, or chemtrails......it is a fight against Christ Himself, and you cannot win! You are the one promoting genocide.......the truest genocide of all!

Your ugliness pours out of you, like puss from a carbuncle! You try to claim I call everyone here, the devil's dupes?! NO! I call ""YOU"" and one or two others, the devil's dupes........and that's putting it mildly!

It's YOUR HELL..............YOU BURN in it!!!

I also can't those gushing idiot local weather news people. I also can't the equally idiotic news anchor who you can count on to add some unecessary idiotic remark to the just given inaccurate forecast. One of those rare times it did rain, this moron from the news turns to the camera and says ""it's great we f-i-n-a-l-l-y got some rain, b-u-t this gosh darn rain won't be no where enough to end this drought"". All the while, he's looking like he's controlling himself from bursting out laughing.

Then there was this awkward 2 seconds of dead air time while that numbnut anchor guy puts on an even bigger smile, tilts his head (looking like that dipshit Shkreli, above), and smacks the stack of blank papers in front of him, before the camera switches over to his co-anchor to talk about the next useless news story.

=================================
Original post

So where the fuck is all the rain that is supposed to come this year, after 4 years of severe drought?

Comical to watch the gushing idiot local news weathermen saying ""Oh, yes....we need the rain...but thank God it didn't rain for the ""Superbore"". 

Meanwhile, SF, Redwood City, San Mateo, Foster City and numerous other provincial backwater Bay Area cities are adding housing like there is a market for people stupid enough to live in an area overpopulated with selfish asshole transplants hoping that their shitty jobs don't evaporate like El Nino has. 

Your first clue how this house of cards unravels should be the Stock Market recently. The FED is in no position to lower or raise interest rates to save us, and the unprecedented EXPERIMENT of flooding the (fak)economy with free money is and will continue to be an epic failure. Like the prospect of no rain in the immediate future, we can look forward to no prosperity either. If you think that our elected idiots holding political office are in any position qualified to legislate solutions to the simplest of our many problems, you are delusional.

The only solace that one may take from this catastrophy is that even the maggot wealthy 1 % er's will suffer the greatest losses when the Global economy collapses under the weight of it's own excesses.

One even offered to for free, may she burn. Women with no soul. My wife wears a ring and several men started conversations with her at Lefty's and other spots and then asked if she wanted to have sex, I came back from the restroom and a drunk was hitting her, I had to shove his ass out of the place and yell at him! 4 men offered me a blow job. WTF? You don't fucking know me, even if you think being gay is OK why would you offer that to someone you don't know.

Good morning:

As I took my walk today I could not help but marvel at the way God, in his infinite wisdom arranged for me to wind up here on Unarius with my butt buddy Jesus. Jesus is the light of my life and I couldn't do without him. As I have already told you my readers, same-sex marriage is not allowed here on this planet but whatever people wish to do with each other is tacitly approved with a wink and a nod. 

Jesus and I had sex seven times today, boy is he hot. I find it exhilarating to be the bride of Christ and sometimes wonder just how long my good fortune will last. He savaged my rectum over and over today, and out of sheer joy and love I got him a butt plug as a gift of remembrance for all the fine servicing he has given me so far. Tonight we no doubt will play kissy poo as foreplay before we get down to serious servicing.

Which brings me to another topic; service to God. All of you my readers who have yet to attest their fealty to the Creator in all His majesty up in the heavens had better hop to it before it is too late. The end times draweth nigh and I wouldn't want to be in the shoes of a sinner who has not yet testified for the greater glory of God and his Son on Earth Jesus. 

Jesus is mine, the heavens are your for when your time comes, but woe to those heathens who still wallow in their sinful ways. Blasphemers can count on spending an eternity in hell.

How to save American football

Make the field twice as wide. Why? We're going to modernize the game for the 21 century. By making the field twice as wide, enough running distance is created so that it becomes a game where the defenders of one team having to catch up with the receiving offense player of the other.

Football will be all about a game of speed and strategy with all of the rough aspects removed (i.e. tackles) eliminated. Once any of the defenders catches up to the offense all that will be required is a 2 hand touch to stop the play right then and there. No need to perform tackles.

The traditional football uniform will still have the helmet, pads, and the whole nine yards. Trust me in this one! It's purely for psychological reasons. People can't get used to too many changes all at once. After 10 years or so, we can begin introducing the new rugby-like uniforms that are more appropriate to the newly evolved game of football. 

Football's greatest days are yet to come, with NO concussions, to boot! This will be great. Believe me folks, these kinds of changes are inevitable for the good ol' American grid iron game to survive. Oh, and it will. Football is a highly adaptable sport. Long live American football!

party. Most will come from over 100 Million in extra law enforcement costs. With overtime costs skyrocketing they say there is nothing that can be done at this time. They state that the extra police and military personal have paid off because no terrorist activity has been seen or even anticipated up until now. Even so they plan on increasing the number of police by 10000 by game time. Large groups of marching police in the hundreds have been seen daily throughout S.F. In fact game goers say that seems to be the best intertainment up until now. One visitor thought this was normal for S.F. They watched as a group of 20 police smashed in the head of a suspect who had walked in a red light. This is considered a Felony now in most areas of S.F. As a safety measure to keep order. Attack dogs are being deployed and seem to be effective. Hospitals are reporting incidents of thousands of dog bites but aren't sure if it's related to these attack dogs. The City plans on raising taxes and cutting programs to pay for the added security. They say they may even leave it in place permantly to keep the public

The Homeless want panhandling legalized on all on and off ramps and all medians in S.F. They also say they need to have stoves and or fireplaces to cook and keep warm. This deal allows both, so if you now see open fire pits don't worry it's ok. The legalized panhandling will limit signage to no more than 4 ft by 4 ft, on cardboard supplied by S.F. Any messages on this signage will be protected by the constitution of the U.S. Or the S.F. Bill of rights take your pick. Expanded needle exchange programs will be put in place, and the City will actually start supplying Herion and Speed to needy persons. They say this will reduce crime. The monthly allowance will be increased to $700 per month and be in cash. These were just a few of the items negotiated. Somehow they also were allotted 8000 jerseys in the deal.
Homeless will now have the use bike lanes to push shopping carts, this will enhance their ability to transverse the City. They will also be allowed to ignore traffic laws.

No excuse! Unless there is an underlying medical condition here's a tip for women about 'keeping it clean'
1)When showering, suds up with an unscented or low fragrance bar of soap(to prevent irritation) shave well and following that run your fingers through all folds and let the shower rinse as you continue running your fingers through until all soap has been rinsed.Next, and this is just as important, with the shower running and as you continue insert your finger into your vagina and swish it around using a circular along with in and out motion until little to no slimy feel is present.
2)After showering, a light splash of fragrance is nice in anticipation of 'getting lucky'
3)If you want a sweet flavor 'down there', chewing about five sticks of any gum or 1 glass of any drink with saccharine within 2 hours of intimate contact is sure to please! 
PS:If there is any bad odor inside or outside after all that, or even what looks like white blobs (signs of a yeast infection) you need to see a Doctor as soon as possible!

========================================================================
Dear Congresswoman Barbara Lee & Staff: Last week I received an unsigned letter from the Department of Health Services / Center For Medicare Services dated 12/30/15. I can't prove that this letter is the work of newbie Paul Ryan & Posse, but I've been retired six years and have never received anything so confusing & demeaning. The envelope was stamped 'Official Government Business' & carried a minimum fine of $300.00 for any suspected misuse. Inside were 4 unsigned pages in extra large font = 'Important 2015 Tax Information & IRS Health Coverage Form # 1095B.' The next red flag was that this notice was intended only for recipients 65 years of age and under (I'm 66). The letter warned that I must file a health care exemption or pay a hefty penalty for my 'inadequate & illegal healthcare coverage.' I have had Medicare part A coverage for 6 years as well as supplemental coverage through Anthem Blue Cross. Because I didn't have adequate coverage, the letter warned, I needed to contact my physician and learn where my plan fell short of Federally Mandated Guidelines. On the already-completed, enclosed 1095B form was the clear designation that I, in fact, have more than adequate coverage (Medicare part A & gap coverage as well). So, in whose interests & for what purposes was this expensive National mailing made, except to harass, intimidate, & denigrate retirees? The assumption that we are falsifying IRS forms, perjuring ourselves, & trying to get 'free health care' is all over these bewildering documents. When I called the 1-800 number after a 15 minute wait, I was informed that this was just a 'friendly neighborhood reminder' to pay up all my accrued, compounded IRS penalties or else. Again, the HHS/CMS already knew I was fully covered due to the enclosed, completed 1095B forms. At best this is another abortive, cryptic, & inciteful 'encyclical' from the super far right regarding forthcoming proposed changes to Social Security & Medicare. At worst it is just plain old fashioned bullying & abusive threatening of elderly seniors, veterans, the disabled & homeless. During the President's SOTU Address I didn't see Ryan clap once. Where is the outrage from the AARP about these insulting, costly, & degrading mailings? If I receive any more of these 'dire messages' from the Fed. your office will be the first to know.Thanks again for your kind attention to these matters. As ever, Aloysius Weathers & Family Oakland, Ca. 94611

I've been doing so well. Taking my meds daily. Battling this crippling depression because she hammers these daggers into my heart in every move she makes. Oh yes I'm being dramatic. We have 3 kids together. The youngest not even talking, the oldest in school.

My heart aches for my loves. I am a child of a broken home. She was not. She doesn't understand.

I know she's going to fuck him. I think she already did on her last business trip. The difference now is it's blatant, there's no business it's all pleasure. She's using travel rewards and some money she got from an estate her aunt gave her (not much so I don't feel right fighting her about it).

I don't want her to go. She leaves early Sunday morning. It's going to be the longest 4 days of my life.

I love her. I feel like fighting her going is just going to make it worse. Trying to let go, in hopes that she sees I'm changing, for the better. Not for her, for me and at worst for my kids. My love for her is stronger than it ever was.

I'm looking at personals, knowing that is where her and I began more than 10 years ago. Feeling guilty just needing someone to care about me beyond what she's willing to.

It's only been 4 months, since it all began. We are still living under the same roof. I can deal with it. But knowing she's going to be doing what she's going to is killing me.

Nobody wants a fat depressed nerd who's wife left him for a man 2,500 miles away with 3 small children.

Will I find love or even a conversation that isn't looming with a pain of lost love...

Pleas help me find my way, if you dare. Give me your wisdom or your pity or your acceptance and understanding and hope that maybe just maybe it will be alright.

I will not be my father and be absent. I will not be my mother and fall into an abyss of depression and sorrow. I will get heathy, I will stop taking these meds, they are only to stop the bleeding from my daggered heart.

I will hold up my hand and feel the light of love reaching into my third eye flame. All is not lost I know this, but what do I do now in this moment.

So where the fuck is all the rain that is supposed to come this year, after 4 years of severe drought?

Comical to watch the gushing idiot local news weathermen saying ""Oh, yes....we need the rain...but thank God it didn't rain for the ""Superbore"". 

Meanwhile, SF, Redwood City, San Mateo, Foster City and numerous other provincial backwater Bay Area cities are adding housing like there is a market for people stupid enough to live in an area overpopulated with selfish asshole transplants hoping that their shitty jobs don't evaporate like El Nino has. 

Your first clue how this house of cards unravels should be the Stock Market recently. The FED is in no position to lower or raise interest rates to save us, and the unprecedented EXPERIMENT of flooding the (fak)economy with free money is and will continue to be an epic failure. Like the prospect of no rain in the immediate future, we can look forward to no prosperity either. If you think that our elected idiots holding political office are in any position qualified to legislate solutions to the simplest of our many problems, you are delusional.

The only solace that one may take from this catastrophy is that even the maggot wealthy 1 % er's will suffer the greatest losses when the Global economy collapses under the weight of it's own excesses.

Denny's requiring Blacks to pre-pay
This is a pretty smart move. Anyone who's been to a Denny's in the Bay Area knows that the customers most likely to try to leave without paying are...you know. I was at the one in Emeryville a few years ago, only place around open at 03:00, and in the hour we were there there were at least 3 instances of waitresses having to stop you-know-who from walking out before they paid.

It's sad that the rest of us have to suffer; show receipts when leaving stores, having to walk past armed guards at DOLLAR STORES, having to pay public employees to pick up all the trash and half eaten fast food thrown on the street, and all the rest that comes with having a sizable Black population.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/rnr/5435856934.html,Paul Ryan & His Flying Wingbats Exposed,"
Dear Congresswoman Barbara Lee & Staff: Last week I received an unsigned letter from the Department of Health Services / Center For Medicare Services dated 12/30/15. I can't prove that this letter is the work of newbie Paul Ryan & Posse, but I've been retired six years and have never received anything so confusing & demeaning. The envelope was stamped 'Official Government Business' & carried a minimum fine of $300.00 for any suspected misuse. Inside were 4 unsigned pages in extra large font = 'Important 2015 Tax Information & IRS Health Coverage Form # 1095B.' The next red flag was that this notice was intended only for recipients 65 years of age and under (I'm 66). The letter warned that I must file a health care exemption or pay a hefty penalty for my 'inadequate & illegal healthcare coverage.' I have had Medicare part A coverage for 6 years as well as supplemental coverage through Anthem Blue Cross. Because I didn't have adequate coverage, the letter warned, I needed to contact my physician and learn where my plan fell short of Federally Mandated Guidelines. On the already-completed, enclosed 1095B form was the clear designation that I, in fact, have more than adequate coverage (Medicare part A & gap coverage as well). So, in whose interests & for what purposes was this expensive National mailing made, except to harass, intimidate, & denigrate retirees? The assumption that we are falsifying IRS forms, perjuring ourselves, & trying to get 'free health care' is all over these bewildering documents. When I called the 1-800 number after a 15 minute wait, I was informed that this was just a 'friendly neighborhood reminder' to pay up all my accrued, compounded IRS penalties or else. Again, the HHS/CMS already knew I was fully covered due to the enclosed, completed 1095B forms. At best this is another abortive, cryptic, & inciteful 'encyclical' from the super far right regarding forthcoming proposed changes to Social Security & Medicare. At worst it is just plain old fashioned bullying & abusive threatening of elderly seniors, veterans, the disabled & homeless. During the President's SOTU Address I didn't see Ryan clap once. Where is the outrage from the AARP about these insulting, costly, & degrading mailings? If I receive any more of these 'dire messages' from the Fed. your office will be the first to know.Thanks again for your kind attention to these matters. As ever, Aloysius Weathers & Family Oakland, Ca. 94611

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/rnr/5435852624.html,Enjoy Superbowl 50. There will not be a Superbowl 60.,"
Well, that's probably an exaggeration. There might be a Superbowl 60, but I'll bet there won't be a 75.
The sport of American Football is about to come to a grinding halt. With all the data on concussions, and lawsuits, many youth programs are closing, and many high schools have started to cancel football as a sport. I think in less than 10 years NO high school will have football, meaning that colleges will have no recruits (those that still HAVE football), and thus the NFL will have no recruits.

So, maybe 15 years before the NFL runs out of new players, and another 5 for the ones already there to be done with their athletic careers. 

The only thing that could save the sport would be a way to prevent concussions. Since helmets cannot effectively do that (it's the brain sloshing around from abrupt stops, not the softness of the thing hitting the head), maybe the rules have to be changed. I wonder if having NO helmets and NO pads, maybe even NO shoes would prevent players from hitting so hard, because THEY would get hurt, too.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/rnr/5435834198.html,Stop Blaming The Poor: The Government Is The Biggest Thief Of All,"
""Why should I pay higher taxes so that some lazy poor person can pick up another unemployment check and then go back to sitting on the couch and spending my money?"" This is the increasingly commonplace question posed by the middle-class, and especially the wealthy. Assertions about the poor being lazy, thieving leeches on society are not surprising coming from Tea Party Members and many in the Republican Party. Blaming the poor is troubling because it hinders solutions to assist the poor, and prevents learning. 

It is one of the biggest misconceptions (or lies) about this country that is one of the main causes of hostility towards the poor. The United States prides itself on a promise of equal opportunity. However, the simple truth of the matter is that this promise is a farce. Some people are born with a trust fund and a summer house in the Hamptons, while some are born to a single-parent low-income family in a city slum. That's just the way life is.

With the belief of equal opportunity so strong, it empowers the idea that the poor are lazy. Many believe that poverty is something that can be broken out of with hard work alone. However, a poor kid who lives in a city slum is only afforded certain opportunities: the jobs around their area and the schools in their area are large factors. If young people are unable to obtain quality education, it will severely hinder their ability to apply and get into college. Likewise, it is difficult for those same poor young people to obtain decent-paying jobs if they were only able to build work experience through service jobs (fast food, clothing stores, are two examples).

Some people refuse to accept the privileges that they have, in favor of a reality where we are all equal in the United States. Until we stop blaming, and start listening and helping, the inequality and hatred towards the poor in this country will continue for years, maybe decades to come. The biggest thieves do business on Wall Street and work for the FBI, CIA, and IRS.

http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/rnr/5435833526.html,Practical Ways To Stop Illegal Immigration,"
#1. Place more troops along the border. (Placing National Guard or federal troops along the porous U.S.-Mexican border would bring about a serious reduction in the number of invaders attempting to cross into this country. Treating the illegals as an invading army and actually firing upon them would end the invasion completely.)

#2. Pass legislation which would require anyone wiring money to another country to prove their legal status in the U.S. (Wire transfers from illegals working in this country is Mexico's second largest industry behind oil exports.)

#3. Charge Mexico's government for the living expenses for every illegal alien currently held in U.S. prisons. (Illegal aliens account for 30 percent of the total U.S. prison population. Currently, American taxpayers are burdened with the expense of caring for these criminals. If Mexico refuses, we could enact an embargo against Mexican goods until they pay up.)

#4. Deport all illegal aliens immediately upon discovery. Sounds simple, but our politicians claim it is too difficult. A great way to start is to require all public schools to report all suspected illegal alien students. Any principals or school boards that don't comply simply have their federal funding suspended. The idiotic ""sanctuary city"" law is abolished. 

#5. Make it a federal crime punishable by at least ten years in prison for any employer who hires an illegal alien. Unscrupulous employers who would much rather pay slave wages to illegals than a living wage to an American citizen, should be considered today's slave masters. If the lure of jobs was ended, the human tidal wave would diminish significantly.

The preceding are serious steps which could be taken to stop this national crisis. Our government is more than capable of carrying out all of them. However, too much of our current leadership has no will to do so. Our politicians care more for lining their pockets with money made on the backs of illegals and potential Latino votes than they do for maintaining any quality of life for U.S. citizens.

I'm also open to any size guy but I would also prefer WM's in my area (just a preference guys sorry), and am not really looking to travel too far to meet someone. Also, please have some training as I'm looking for buddies to help me train and not someone who just ""can take a punch."" I'm pretty much free during the day but could meet evenings if you have a place to spar. One last thing, please be sincere about doing this, I've had so many people respond only to have their emails suddenly become un-deliverable. Maybe it was something I said LOL. So if you're still reading this and would be interested please drop me a line and I'd be glad to meet with you. Again, thanks for reading my ad and I hope to hear from you soon.

Hello,

I'm looking for a friend that wouldn't mind being a tag along or partner to work out with on base after work, before work, or for lunch. Right now, I'm doing good at getting to the gym at least 4-5 days a week and putting in somewhere about 45 min to 2 hrs of work. This ranges from spin classes, rowing, and novice lifting. I'd love a guide who can show me some new routines and help me see some expanded results. Of course, I'd like to expand the friendship past the gym as well. If you're interested, let me know.

I'm in my mid 20s and looking to expand my social circle. I'm interested in meeting people who are looking for the same.

About me: 21, black, athletic . I like to go hiking when its warmer, I do a lot of outdoor activities, I am a college student, I don't have a lot of friends here and I would like to meet and just hang out with other people my age. 

About you: I think most people can be interesting, so I'm not picky on age, race, or anything else. I am, however, looking for platonic only.

Do you wish there was an older man in the local area with whom you could confide and share your ideas, questions, goals, successes, disappointments, and fantasies? Are you intrigued by the idea of having a completely open-minded father figure who will listen without criticizing or judging? Do you long for someone experienced and assertive with whom you can safely explore your submissive personality in a caring, nurturing way?

I am a local college instructor in my mid forties who would like to pursue with a younger woman a relationship that is more meaningful and less transient than the professional relationships I have with my students. You could be a college student or a college-educated young professional. In order for this to work, you would need to be somewhere in the DC metro area and willing to meet in person. This would be our secret, so I don't mind if you are already in a relationship (as long as you don't mind the same about me). If this sounds interesting, let's meet for a walk or a cup of coffee so we can see whether we have the right chemistry.

Hey guys. I'm visiting the DC area around the first week of March from Columbus, OH. Looking for a platonic, cool, intelligent, respectful and kind person to hang with me while we see some sites and have some lunch. My friend that lives there works 9 to 6 and I don't wanna waste any day light waiting. If you're not any of the adjectives I mentioned earlier DO NOT APPLY. If you think this will lead to a hookup DO NOT APPLY. If you don't send pics ( clean pics ) with first message I will not reply to you. Don't mean to be strict, but I'd like to weed out the crazies, the advantage seekers and manipulitive people. Also before meeting you I'd like to scan your fb to confirm your identity. Yeah I can be a bit anal, but safety and security is my top priority.I don't smoke but if you do please don't do it every five mins in my face. Patience and knowledge of areas are a plus! Please be around my age. Anything else I'm open minded to. Couples, roomies, LGBT peeps, students, professionals, amateur politicians, etc.

Hi there,

Just testing the waters to see if there is anyone out there kinda fits my situation. As the title says, I like to think of myself as a cinephile. I typically average 4-8 movies a month. I'm not currently dating because I'm devoting time to an ailing parent and work. Yet, I often devote at least 1-3 nights per week to a movie. Sounds expensive right? Well that's where the Movie Pass comes in. If you're not familiar, in short it's a membership card that allows you to see 1 movie a day, everyday, for $30 dollars a month. In this area, it's currently $30 a month. In Cali, it might be $40.
Anyway, last month I saw three movies in one week and the card paid for itself, with 3 weekends of movies to go!! Can't beat it!!
Me: 32yr, single, AA male, average size (getting i shape for the spring though), professional, college educated, respectful and respectable.
You: 25-45yrs, sane, mobile, pleasant, easy on the eyes, avid movie goer, average to plus size is fine, drama/kid free, must have decent hygiene (good whisper breath!!).

Looking to find someone that fits the bill by next week, Deadpool!! I'm real, you should be too. Seeing Pride and Prejudice Zombies tonight...then a movie called Room tomorrow. Mention the last movie you saw in the title of your response so I know you're real.

I'm a peaceful chill friendly SINGLE very thoughtful educated but not snobby funky guy looking to have some new experiences and meet artsy hippy new agey people. I'm open to different backgrounds but I tend to click best with people who think about life, the universe and everything and are not dogmatic about religion and beliefs. I am open to anyone of any age 18 - 89. No commitments - just anything from people watching to a chat to a hangout to a road trip or a motorcycle or bike ride or chess or scrabble or coffee. I like meeting random people. About me: I'm straight, (again) single (healthy and happily) NOT looking for a relationship. I like being single!!! I have a good and busy life as a professional and am one of those people that always has a handful of little ""projects"" going on. I am interested in all the usual stuff. I'm a former rock musician and still active musically. I love Netflix. I'm spiritual but not religious. I like culture and arts but also science and technology. I have an international background but am culturally white preppy suburban liberal alternative nerdy. I like NPR and read the Economist. I like goth chicks. I also read comic books and graphic novels and draw cartoons. I like lots of random things like people watching, thrift stores, tarot cards, alternative medicine, sci-fi, shopping malls, antique malls, store from random countries like Korean stores etc., sneaking into meetings and conferences I have nothing to do with, social activism, going to the airport for no reason, riding the metro for no reason. I'm very liberal and open minded and feel people should try and make the most of each and every moment. I like cuddling, hugs and holding hands (in private). I'm tall and in decent shape with a bit of middle aged bio mass, but being tall I hide it well. I'm a proud father (divorced with my kids half the time so I end up with a fair amount of free time), I'm a white collar professional, I'm a strong leader without being an a$$hole (at least I think so). My teenage son says his high school friends say I'm a cool dad. So if you're bored or lonely and want some nonthreatening company, send me a note and say hi. Please say something about yourself in your reply and send a pic if you want one? Peace.

In some ways I don't mind it because I don't have to spend time planning my days and weekends, other times, it's downright suffocating.

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/doc/stp/5408990568.html,Some CL thoughts - m4w,"
Here's some helpful tips for all you CL'ers out there:

1. The ratio of real ads posted by men versus real ads posted by women in roughly 100 to 1. In other words men, you have very little chance of getting a response from a woman who has posted an ad on CL.
2. Men should be aware that women typically get 100s of responses to their ads, so if they respond to you, that means they've picked you out of hundreds of men, act accordingly. But it can also mean that they will be corresponding with perhaps dozens of men while they are also chatting with you. Be patient with them.
3. Women should be aware that if you respond to a man's ad, you are likely the only real response he's received from that ad. That means, frankly, that he will focus his efforts on you because you are the only one he is chatting with regarding his ad.
4. Everybody lies and virtually everyone is chatting with more than one person while they are also chatting with you, even if it's people they've met online from years past. It's just human nature.
5. Guys will drive a conversation toward sex 90 percent of the time, sometimes in a subtle way sometimes in a not so subtle manner. Women, if you don't like that sort of banter, explicitly tell the guy you don't want to chat about such things.
6. Inexplicably, men still send their dick pictures to women unsolicited. . . this is the quickest way to end a correspondence with a woman.
7. Women are just as bad as men when it comes to ending correspondence without explanation and for no apparent reason. What's up with that?
8. Guys place ads and respond to ads in every section of CL for the same purpose: S.E.X.
9. Don't become too emotionally invested in someone that you've met online from CL too soon. Why? Because the vast majority of CL connections end after a few days, at best. So why put yourself through the emotional pain?
10. The vast majority of women will never meet a man they are corresponding with on CL, no matter what they say in their ad. And for good reason, they don't really know the guy and frankly, they are more curious than anything else. There's a big difference between chatting and being in the same place at the same time with a man that a woman barely knows.
11. Always be ready for disappointment. All CL relationships eventually end. It's sad, but true.
12. Above all else, have fun and don't take yourself too seriously, leave that task to others 

Hi Ladies,

I am hoping to meet a woman for friendship, conversation and hopefully company for outings and activities. I am in my early thirties, independent, established and very mature. I am attractive, girly, nice shape and well groomed. Other characteristics - laid back, down to earth and genuinely caring. In my free time, I enjoy theater events, concerts, wine tastings, nice restaurants, cooking, spa trips, and traveling. It would be nice to meet someone to enjoy these activities with me. I am not really looking for a relationship but more like companionship and a mutual connection with someone with similar interests and characteristics.

So that we don't waste each other's time I am NOT looking for men, transgender, married, couples or otherwise attached, NSA and I am not 420 friendly. You should be pretty, attractive, feminine and have a nice body. Please be emotionally/mentally stable, have some things going for yourself, drama free and available to spend time and get to know each other.

If you are interested please tell me something about yourself, share a picture and I will do the same.

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/mld/w4w/5435932584.html,If it is about more than anatomy...,"

Some years ago a bi-sexual woman friend/lover described me as a lesbian trapped in a man's body. Although she insisted that she was being serious and meant it in the most complimentary way, I took it rather lightly, as her just trying to project dual characteristics onto me. However, when a very similar comment was made by another woman years later, it was impossible to dismiss as easily. 
After much subsequent thought and experience, I've come to believe that their observations and analyses were accurate. They had both said that I connected with them physically and emotionally in ways they found more like that of the women they had been with rather than any of the men, and that my ways of thinking, while masculine, were not like that of any of the men they had known. That in part, probably goes all the way back to when, as an adolescent, while my male contemporaries were trying to learn what lies would most likely enable them to ""score"", I had, quite independently, found and read authors like Simone de Beauvior in an effort to actually understand women. Disappointingly, however, then and since, I've found that many women, despite claims to the contrary, seem uncomfortable with a man who honestly tries to understand them, and seem instead to prefer the lies they want to hear from someone clueless about how they really feel. And indeed, a number of my relationships have ended due to my disappointments with my female partners that sound like those most commonly expressed by women concerning their male partners e.g. them having a disconnect between the physical and emotional aspects of the relationship, them not being comfortable with intimacy other than during sex, their lack of real communication leaving me feeling emotional and intellectually isolated, etc. 

I'm a 6', lean, fit, good looking, single Caucasian, with advanced degrees who, though cerebral and in some ways fitting with the image of one involved in intellectual and artistic pursuits, also has the appearance of someone much more physically oriented and thus the antithesis of the stuffy or nerdy intellectual stereotypes. While sometimes a bit intimidating to those who don't know me, I am actually very laid back, easy going, and flexible on most things (though decisive when need be, and intense when, and in those things, where intensity is desirable). I am totally confident and secure in who I am, and thus have no problem with strong, assertive women, and/or those who do not conform to expected images or roles. My attitudes are obviously not those of the typical guy, and while very masculine in personality and characteristics, you will probably find that among my wide range of interests, skills, and activities there are quite a few that you wouldn't expect, and at least some that overlap with yours. However, I am not much into the more passive and ""pre-packaged"" sorts of entertainment, so if you are really into things like movies, or live theater, you might still have to pursue those with female friends most of the time. 

I realize that many of the women reading these postings are specifically seeking the physical attributes of a female in a partner. At least a few though, undoubtedly primarily want a partner with whom they can they can feel an intense connection on all levels, for a fulfilling, loving relationship regardless of anatomy, and have just been assuming that they will find what they are seeking in a woman. If that is the case, and you are looking through these CL postings, its obvious that you, like I, haven't found that special partner and relationship among those you expected to. So why not consider the possibly that the ""lesbian"" you hoped to find might be very different from what you imagined. 

Apart from finding the slender to average range the most aesthetically pleasing, I don't have any rigid physical criteria, and often find features that are different or unusual the most attractive . As for age, while largely irrelevant, it seems most likely that a compatible partner will be, like me, ""over 40"". I am looking for someone who, like me, has a healthy lifestyle without being obsessive about it, and avoids reckless behavior. Beyond that, all else is pretty much open to consideration, with experience having taught that the best often turns out to be that which is most unexpected.

I swear I've tried this whole CL thing one to many times... But let's see.... 

I am a 34 year old AA ""soft stud"". We all know our community needs to identify you with a label so there's mine. Right now I am very newly single so I am not in anyway looking for a relationship. What I do want is to meet a real cool, laid back/low key, honest, humble, attractive, smart and independent grown woman! Someone who likes to go shopping, take road trips, talk about and share good reads, travel to random restaurants trying new foods. Someone who likes to play video games, likes sports, listens to all kinds of music, has an interest in any and everything intellectual.. A woman who likes to smoke one and sit back with a glass of wine just laughing and talking about whatever... 

Me... I'm very laid back and sometimes quiet until I warm up to you. I'm hard working and independent. College educated. No children, yet. Never married, yet. 2nd to youngest of 4 sisters and 2 brothers. Originally from NY but been in the DMV for over 15 years now. I write, I read, I sing, I travel (a lot), I'm honest, I'm funny, I'm spiritual, I'm non judge mental... Fuck it you won't find anyone else on here like me!! I'm a Gemini :) 
I drive my own vehicle but don't currently have my own place considering I am just transitioning from a 4 year relationship which we lived together. I am now occupying a friends couch for the time being but please understand that I am very capable of retaining my own. I just want a real friend that's attractive, smart, fun and someone who gets me... If more comes of it then it was just in the universe for it to happen. So let's see what happens...

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/doc/w4w/5425894005.html,Cazo... I still think of you,"
July of this year will mark 10 years since we met in this section on CL. It's crazy how vividly I remember the very first messages we exchanged. Who knew I would meet one of my soul mates on here. It was a whirlwind of ""good"" love that eventually left me with a life of memories.
I often wonder how you're doing. I never thought the letter I left on the counter in September of 2011 would be the last of us. . . but it was NEEDED. We were so toxic to one another and we were killing off whatever may have been left inside of us.
I've wondered if you've been able to find any kind of love that can come close to YOUR true vision of what love should be. I always knew and still do believe that you can love with every fiber of your being. I eventually realized I was not meant to be given that love from you. We had too many faults from the very beginning. I always felt you were too good for me. But I always felt I could compensate that in some weird way by being overly passionate about you, loving you the way I knew best back then (we all know how horribly bad that went), and most of all. . .. the reason why no matter what we went through together, the endless fucking. Fuck. That was some mind blowing shit. To this day I STILL think of the many nights full of passion and intensity. Rage and hurt. Love and regret. We had too many of those nights. Our sexual obsession is what kept us digging a deeper hole than we ever should have. We were once the best of friends that now are a distant memory. Did you ever see us getting here? I didn't. . ..
We had a conversation or two about how we would one day end up back together even if we married someone else. As time has gone on. . . I can't say that that still stands on my end. I met an amazing woman who has been SO patient with me and understanding. Because of her, I realized I was not the best me I could have been while you and I were together. A part of me feels like I cheated you, cheated me, and cheated us of the love we could have created. But lack of maturity and emotional stability on my part impeded that. I think of what would be of us had we met a few years later. . . I feel we were the classic case of meeting at the wrong damn time. 
Cazo, wherever you are, if you are reading this. . . just know I still think of you. I can honestly say not a single day since we met, has gone by that I don't think of you. Even still. . . as I have moved on and married an amazing woman. . . I still think of you. Not because I want you, but because I still care. Always have and always will. 
Thank you for what you taught me. Whether you know it or not, you made me a better lover, a better person. Life is all about taking risks. I took a chance in love with you and I gave you a piece of me I can never get back. And that's okay. Because not having done that, I wouldn't have gotten to this emotional and mental space to write this without placing blame. Accountability is now a big part of me and I know I fucked up many times. But I can't change our past. 
I just hope you're okay...

Any virus can be killed. They all need a host cell to survive. So the treatment would involve a therapy that keeps them from attaching to the cell to reproduce. If they are kept outside from the host for over three weeks to a month then like all active proteins, They lose energy. For a lack of a better word, They starve. 

All symptoms of herpes simplex 1 and 2 can be removed from the body permanently. This is what medical industry wont tell you. Your privacy is important.

If you're femme, into Butch women and feel this way send me a message. There is something about being in close proximity to a butch woman that makes me go a little fluttery inside -- kind of melty and shy, and occasionally, bold. Perhaps this is accentuated by the fact that butches are rare and precious in my particular corner of the universe, but when and wherever they cross my path, something within me sits up and takes notice -- because I share the other side of the secret. I know the special magic that happens when female yin meets female yang, and the opposite polarity locks us together like magnets caught up in each other's sway.

I don't pretend to understand my preference for women on the masculine side of the gender spectrum anymore than I understand why I am attracted to women in the first place. It just is. Why not just date a dude? The short answer is easy: because I'm a dyke, and because butch women are just that -- women. But that explanation leaves rather a lot of important things out.

If you are a femme and into butches please be so kind to send
Me a message. Not bbw or thick women please. No offense.

Hello. I am in my mid twenties and am fully bi sexual although very inexperienced. It is something which has dominated my sexual thoughts for a long time. I am a very private person and naturally submissive. I have a male partner who supports and encourages me to explore this side of me. I am very interested in finding someone to explore my bi side with, my partner would not be involved. I work in the Rockville, MD area but would be happy to travel to some extent. I am looking for a female (any age, race, or size) to explore and learn with. If you sit on the more dominant side of things that would be fabulous, but if not that is no problem. Please put ""shake"" in the subject line so I know you are real. Looking forward to hearing from interested people.

She is my wild affair and she wants to play with a woman.

I really am down to earth. I like metro bus rides and hot dogs. Well I am vegan but you see my point. The thing is, I like a nice life style. I really enjoy feeling sexy and the things that make me feel sexy are going to the gym, working with a personal trainer to look and feel my best, wearing nice tailored clothes, going to the spa and hair salon once a week. All of that is really expensive and I think the man that benefits from me looking amazing and being on his arm should pay for it. I like an allowance in a relationship and when I don't have that component I feel underappreciated and deprived. I know that will get critics and if you don't agree that's fine. If you agree keep reading

My ideal man is older than me, I am 23, my ex was 49, before him 39.... so age is not an issue, I actually prefer a gap. I appreciate having a friend and mentor.

I've been single for a while and though I'm independent and very happy with my life, I feel like a quality relationship where you can share everything is a force multiplier for happiness.

Anyway, a bit about me...I've lived in the area just over 6 years, currently in Arlington on my own and loving it. I'm 28, tall, and curvy. I've been told I have great legs and a beautiful smile! :) More importantly, I consider myself to be kind, witty, smart, reliable, loyal, and affectionate - I hope to find the same in a man! I love watching football, trying new restaurants, long walks when the weather is nice, reading, watching tv/movies, and cooking.

Please send me a message if you'd like to chat and think we may get along. Either way, I hope you have a wonderful 2016!

Whether we're just friends, fwb, or we end up head over heels for one another. Whatever may come of this I just want someone to have fun with. Someone non-judgmental and with an open mind. 

Please respond with a photo of your face and an attempt at a grammatically correct introduction. I will not respond back to anyone who says 'hey grl, how r u' or just 'pic?', or a photo of your package ahaha. That irks me and is an instant turn off, just a fair warning.
Please also be between the ages of 18-26 so we have more in common. 

And if you have kik, you can send me your username if you care to. Since I'm expecting a little attraction I'll let you know that I'm a black girl, as I know that's not every guys preference, and I prefer not to waste anyone's time. I'm also not the thinnest girl, but I'm working on that. Maybe we could even be workout buddies, who knows!

A sexy, attractive (at least that's what my recent dates keep saying, lol), nice, white, college-educated, non-smoker, easy-going, neat, fit, trim woman seeks a nice mature guy, 25-30ish, with same type qualities. Never wore a uniform myself, but I love seeing Military Officers wearing theirs. Love movies, sports, going to the gym, beaches, drinking wine, eating out or just hanging at home watching a nice movie. Happy being all dressed up or enjoying a casual time out. Since ending a relationship I've been dating a great deal. Just haven't found the right fun guy who I would actually consider potential for a long term event. 

So I figured, what the heck, lets see what kind of responses I might get. Would love to spend time with a respectful, honest, good-humored guy willing to end quality time together and see what the future could hold. A reply with a nice smiling, respectful face pic will certainly get my attention. Plus, no worries, I respect privacy and NOT looking to collect pics. Better things to do with my time. Any nude pics allows me to quickly hit the DELETE button. 
Same for married men - rekindle that love with your wife!

Anyway, I hope this works. My ad is for real. If interested, I'll reply with a pic. Be glad to chat, text and if we agree, meet in person for a drink or a bite to eat. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. . .so, look forward to hearing from you. Maybe, I'll just meet my best date yet!!!

I need to go into work for a few hours early this afternoon, but after that I thought it might be adventurous if I attempted to meet up with an emotionally available, reasonably attractive and technically unattached gent for a few cocktails somewhere in downtown DC.

I dislike the tasteless exchange of half-naked-bathroom-selfies. In fact, I don't like the swapping of advance photos at all. I fancy myself as being less superficial than most females. (But that proclamation is not as true as I believe it to be!)

I will, however, grant you answers to three questions, if you so desire.

Perhaps we could sign a contract today about where we will vacation together after we fall in love?

Background: My Astrology Zone horoscope reads:
""February 6, has another aspect I love - Mercury in ideal angle to Jupiter, now in your house of true love. This day is truly four-star, so plan something special - you will love the result. Mercury is known to bring either news or travel, possibly with the one you love. If you need to sign a contract, this would be the day to do it.""

LoL. I know this sounds ridiculous, but I need to start taking more chances in regards to dating! Are you with me?!

What else can I say? I'm fine, my life is fine, my friends are fine, everything is fine. But who wants to live with fine? I want more! I want those flutters in my stomach and my heart. I want to get all tingly when my phone rings and I see it's you. I want to anticipate when we will next be together. See, that is all much more than fine.

Like the subject says, I'm looking for a friend AND a lover. I want the whole kit and caboodle. Are you looking for that too?

A little about me.....I'm 41, so while I am 40 that does not mean I want to date someone who can be my father. Please stay plus or minus 5 or so years from 41. I love creating, whether through writing, painting, drawing, cooking, knitting. I want to love running and am trying to. I'll run the Cherry Blossom this spring. Oh, and totally randomly, but I love to camp. Do you?

So bottom line, what are you looking for? Is it similar to what I am looking for? Do you think we might complete each other? A tall order for Craigslist, but I've had success before. Who knows, maybe tonight could be the night (or morning, since it is after midnight).

Shoot me an email if you think you are of a similar mind to myself. I'd love a picture if you are so inclined.

To weed out the Faker McFakies out there, please put ""Camping In The Cold"" as your subject.

Until we chat again,

At the risk of getting swarmed with replies from guys who think pics of their dick are so photogenic (they're really not), I am being honest about what I want and hoping that someone matches up and decides to make himself known.

Single Black woman, early 30s, curvy few extra pounds, caramelly complexion, with HSV. Seeking SINGLE non-smoking man with same or who isn't scared of it. I truly want a longterm relationship, am seriously tired of dating. Problem is that I have a pretty high sex drive, and have chosen to be single for a while, soooooo...yeah...

You must love giving oral, be affectionate, like cuddling even though the term itself is lame. Do NOT contact me if you are just looking to see me once a month or just sleep together and never go out or spend time together outside of sex. I have roomies so do not want to host, so have your own place or be willing to get a hotel. Also be single (not married, not in a relationship, and not separated), under 42 years old, and a nonsmoker (these aren't negotiable).

Send a pic of your face and tell me about you. Only emails with words and educated sentences will be replied to. Emails with naked pictures and men showing their chest in the bathroom mirror will be trashed. Men who have nothing else to talk about but what they wanna do to me, will be faded out as well. To answer your question, I am real. It is 1:12am on Friday day the 5th, and I'm wondering who's spending time with me soon...

Sabroso be nice to have a connection with someone that motivates me, and I to come motivate them. I would love to be in a relationship with someone who is able to communicate clearly and not play games, be forthright because it just eliminates a lot of the drama. Say exactly what it is that you want or don't want and so be it or will work through it. Everyone goes through their issues, has drama, has baggage from the past. But please let that be something that you grow from and you are working on it actively, I have been in relationships where they bring it into the current relationship and I am a patient woman and am willing to help you work through whatever it is that you're going through it is very draining emotionally and mentally which takes a toll on me. So please don't be too much of a burden. The qualities that I would like in a man is someone who is the obvious things smart, well rounded, easy to talk to, vidi, nice, respectable and excetera. Obvious looks play a major role in the attraction outside of your communication style and how you make me feel when I'm with you. So please send a picture of yourself if you feel as though you are someone that may want to talk with me after reading this little lengthy ad. Also, I enjoy sex, and when sexually attracted my desire for sex is quite insatiable.

My preference is towards confident men who have a balanced lifestyle who are seeking a long term committed relationship. No smoke or drink and be between 38-42 years old. 

Please do not contact me if you are married or already in a relationship. 

Your picture, receive mine.

Wondering if there's still a possibility at this time in life of finding a kind,affectionate and intellectually driven man for fun and relaxing times. 

Interested in virtually everything and very particularly in time outdoors, foreign and indie movies, most forms of music, traveling aimlessly (or intentionally), flea markets. Laugh easily and often. Impressed by substance and sensibility, not by what you have or how you look. Kindness, imagination, and generosity touch my heart. I have a soft spot for men who are happy-hearted, non-pretentious, strong in crisis, and look at the glass as half-full, not half-empty.

If my effort to court and spark caught your attention, let me know!

Spring not winter is my favorite season. Spring is when nature wakes up with the trees and flowers blooming, birds and bees buzzing. What is your favorite season?

My ideal man is an educated professional with a side of redneck. Growing up with lots of brothers hunting and fishing camo is an accepted dress code. Which flavor of redneck are you? Do you have more guns, fishing poles or arrows? 

I am a government executive and do my share of events requiring the LBD, so you need to look great in your tux. I am looking forward to retirement, how about you? Spending a month or so in Australia and SCUBA diving the Great Barrier Reef is the first thing I plan to cross off my bucket list. Do you SCUBA dive?

Pictures are encouraged and are a must for a response. I prefer a man with hair but if you are bald be proud of it, no hats, facial hair is a turn off for me. I have asked a few questions here so a hey there will not impress me.

Relax I'm 180 lbs. and 5'8' in height that's good proportion last time I checked. I'm black and I think it's because both my parents are black (right now your thinking duh bitch!!). I've been getting a lot of compliments on my face and full lips since I was about 11 so I assume I'm attractive. Any way in order to be with me you have to like Papa John's pizza with sausage, pepperoni and garlic sauce that's very important. I'm in my late 20', single, no kids. I'm more goal oriented than ever now that I'm pushing 30 but I still like to have fun and turn up, my friends would probably call me the ""turn up queen"". You must have a career making a comfortable income, have a car, live outside of your parents house in either a place of your own or if you have a roommate that's fine (your roommate better be another guy), be computer literate, be able to dress like a grown man and be at least 5'9 in height sorry I can't do short guys.

Hello,

I generally do not use Craigslist for dating, but I am not sure where I can find a man who fits what I'm seeking. I would like to find an attractive Indian man who is a U.S. citizen, christian, hindu, or non-religious. I am a black American woman who has a lot to offer the right person. I'm kind, attractive, positive, easy going, well educated, professional, value traditional ways, love pets, enjoy being out and experiencing life. Also, I'm very supportive and can be counted on whether a matter's important or less important. I've always felt a connection to Indian people since I was young and still today. I can't help but follow the natural vibe and pattern in finding the right someone for me. 

It would be great to find a man who has a more or less liberal family, who is smart, single, kind hearted, reliable, well educated, attractive, assertive, handsome and very easy going. If this is you then I would love to meet. Please provide a photo with your response with a short intro on what makes you special. I look forward to hearing from you!

I know it sounds strange on the surface, maybe even a little unbelievable but I'm very sincere. The dynamic appeals to me on so many levels. I want to be what you don't have at home, simple as that. You can't leave your husband or don't want to for many or whatever reason. I understand and don't want you to. I don't want to ruin your marriage. I will commit to you though, if we're right. I live alone and when you have time, my place is yours, too. I am looking for the excitement that comes from the two of us not being able to be together all the time! The denial that will naturally occur because you are married will fuel our desire to see each other. Lets write, then meet and find out we can't resist...

Only you know why you are wondering around the nooks and crannies of CL but if you are the right lady I have an idea for you.

It does not matter if this post is a week or six months old. I am running it in multiple US cities and I am renewing the post every 2 days until the right lady comes along. When she does I'll pull this post but until then, the offer is open.

I am looking for a lady on disability or SS or supports themselves by working from home over the net.
She has to be at least 37 years old but under 66 years old and still active enough to enjoy swimming and day trips. I might consider someone younger then 37 depending on her personality.
I'll Repeat Myself, You Must Be On Disability Or Social Security Or Have An Independent Income.
If that is you keep reading you might like this idea.
You can be White, Oriental, Vietnamese, Asian, Spanish, Chinese, Puerto Rican or Native American.

What I have in mind is to live together on a tropical island and be unique but happy couple.

I know, you're sure that your $700.00 a month makes it impossible to live in the tropics. Normally you would be right, but not this time. 

I am an older white male that has literally retired to a tropical island in the Caribbean. 
In fact I am just over 1,000 miles South of Key West. 
Bermuda, The Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic are all North of Me.
I have the apartment, I have the car, I get a pension check.
I am proposing you join me here. 

If you are sick of cold and wet drop me a note.
If you are raising a child or grand child, that is not an issue. I like children and we have some 
good schools here. A brand new Elementary opened up last month and it is only a couple 
minutes away by car.

Most of the replies I get that were actually generated by a human ask about the need for a Passport. This is still part of the U.S. If you are born here you are a US Citizen. You do not need a passport to move here. I do suggest you get one because there are day trips available to a different country. Out in the morning, spend a day in the DR or British Virgins and back that afternoon.

I have gotten some replies that say they would like to move here but they have been in prison.
That Is NOT a problem. If you are not on parole or probation you can move here any time you want.

Of course there are things I am not putting in this post. 
Long posts do not get read. We will talk it all over in e-mail's.

All the pictures are less then 10 Min from my door.

The Caribbean never drops below 80 degrees. Most of the time it is between 81 and 84 degrees.
The temperature never goes below 70 degrees.

Liqueur sales is 24 / 7 and all grocery stores have a basic selection. 
If it is late most Walgreen's are open 24 /7

Gambling is legal here.
I have 2 nice casinos just a few min away.

The drugs, crime, prostitutes and gangs are all in San Juan.
San Juan is 3 hours away.
There is no mass transit or public transportation so the gangs and drugs stay in San Juan.

Prefer non-smoking single, married and/or in an unfulfilled relationship, slender/fit, ddd free (a must!), who wants to explore with an experienced daddy who will mentor, guide, and discipline her, perhaps giving her a new awareness of herself. Favorite color in subject box to get a response.

What I am not looking for is a professional call girl! The woman who most appeals to me is one who wants a relationship with a father figure. She is missing something in her life and/or feels that her true feelings cannot be revealed to her spouse/partner. Perhaps she wants to widen her horizons or to explore her sexuality; perhaps she's bored with the humdrum of the bedroom. (Whatever your reason, dear, you're reading this post...) 
That being said, I will respond to all women who are seeking a true daddy, but I am interested in finding only one true daughter. I know that many women have daddy issues and I would like to help, but please be serious about this as I am and not into merely playing games Thank you for reading.

You are a college student or a young professional, and there is nothing you love more than getting lost in a great book; but you also have a secret weakness for strong intelligent older men. You have imagined yourself as Jane Eyre falling in love with Edward Rochester, young Mrs. de Winter to Maximilian, Clare Abshire to Henry DeTamble, or even a happier Dolores Haze to a less creepy Humbert.

I see you all the time in my day-to-day wanderings. There are many of you out there, but most of you are so quiet, shy, and introverted that it's not easy to penetrate your solitary shell and catch your attention. You carry a book with you everywhere, and you are often so absorbed in your reading that you don't notice the admiring looks you get from older men like me who are beginning to grey at the temples and who have a special weakness for intelligent, thoughtful, introspective young women.

I see you sitting there in the park, on the metro, or in a coffee shop, reading, absorbed in another world, completely oblivious to me as I study you as if you were a Renoir, a Degas, or a Botticelli. My eyes trace the profile of your delicate chin, your sweet little nose, and your cute girlish figure. My hands mentally caress the softness of your pretty hair, a few strands of which have come loose from your pony tail and keep falling into your field of view as you brush them back absentmindedly. Briefly, something distracts you, and you look up just long enough to lock eyes with me. Your eyes are bright and deep, and they look at me with a hint of reproach for staring at you. I smile, and your lips form just the slightest hint of a response, but then you quickly return to your book, refusing to give me the satisfaction of any obvious acknowledgement.

You don't like it when creepy older men stare at you, but somehow when the man is tall, fit, and attractive the whole formula shifts, and you are no longer sure what you like and what you don't. This man looks to be in his mid forties and has an almost paternal gentleness in his demeanor, but you also sense an attraction, a palpable chemistry that is not at all paternal. You noticed a ring on his finger, but it doesn't seem to bother you. You try to keep reading, but you find yourself rereading the same lines over and over. Part of you is annoyed that he has distracted you from your book, and you wish he would go away; but another part of you is secretly intrigued, wondering what would happen if he were to get up, walk over, and sit down next to you. Your heart beats a little faster, and you are suddenly conscious of how you look, the outfit that you picked out for today, the arrangement of your hair.

Suddenly, he stands up. Your heart throbs in your chest as you grip your book and stare at the jumble of words on the page. Out of the corner of your eye you can see his polished leather shoes as he approaches you and stops. What is he doing? What is he waiting for? You want to look up at him a second time, but you are too shy; and the next thing you know, he is walking away. Finally, you look up, but it is too late. You watch the back of his blazer and his well-fitting jeans as he disappears into the crowd.

I understand your shyness. Perhaps that's why you're here on craigslist. Tell me something about yourself that you think I might like to know. Please note, I am not interested in anyone who is underage. You must be an adult.

Hello Ma'am:

I will try my best to get my thoughts through. I am Asian, bisexual, slim, clean and respectful. I am in college. In private, I like to wear panties, stocking, and night gown but no wigs or make up. I am not trying to be passable and I dont want to. I guess it all started when I was a little and stole my mom's panties to play with.

My fantasy is to find a mature lady (40+) who I will call MOM when we go out and in private and treat you as such. Race and weight is unimportant although I have a sweet spot for white BBW. The scene I'm looking for is that you come home and find out that I'm secretly try on your panties and dress and instead of scolding me, you embrace me and tell me I look cute in them. Then we kiss and one thing leads to another I'm sucking on your tits and pussy while still wearing my dress. If you have thought about shoving a dildo into a guy's ass, why not doing your son? :P

Sex is nice but I'd really love to find someone who wants to get into the role. So I can tell you about my day, clean your house, and help you when you're horny. We can go out as mother and son, take a bath together and even go lingerie shopping...etc

I know this is a long shot but I guess I'm gonna keep posting until I find someone. I am happy to send you my face pictures if you ask for it Mom. :)

I'm a really laid back cool good guy and I'm offering a unique opportunity for the right girl, and i'm in search of the right girl. First off I don't need CL to get a date i'm a good guy in decent shape good looking. So this is by no means a desperation thing. What this is, is an opportunity for a great girl to hopefully make a connection and be with me.

I have a nice house I'm responsible I like to have fun I like all kinds of music and movies the beach all the good stuff. I also like to sometimes just chill at home and have good food and watch movies. Trust me I'm a cool laid back dude. A good girl would be proud to have me as their man honestly.

What I'm looking for is a girl that is tired of all the dumb sh*t and BS games and drama and is truly looking to be with a great guy. Trust me I like to have fun and laugh and be laid back so it can be a really all good situation. I'm seeking an attractive cool chic that can be with me and think about a potential future together and have a great LTR. You can potentially come live with me. Maybe you are going through some hard times we all do and maybe you need a place to stay or maybe not but that option is open also.

This can go one of two ways. You could maybe need some help right now and maybe I can be that guy and then we develop this into something. Or you can be a responsible girl and don't need anything at all but just looking to be with a great guy. Either way this can be a great opportunity for us both as long as we are looking for the same things.

Again I'm looking for an attractive in decent shape girl that wants to make a great life together with a great guy. Also you should be able to have fun be laid back crack a joke and laugh and not be all high strung per say. If you think you fit this situation send me some pics and tell me about yourself. I'll return with the same back to you.

Hope to hear from you and see how we can make this into something really good.

Not saying getting married lol but you know what I mean. I'm 21 years young , Latino , average weight , empoyled , black hair , brown eyes, some tattoos , 420 friendly , Im very laid back . Legit all I do is work and stay at home. I do go out from time to time but im more of a homebody type of guy. I like wearing dress shirts and ties but I don't mind wearing snapbacks and hipster shit.

I can't believe you're curious, you shouldn't even be looking at a married man's post! Seriously, I guess I'm just intellectually honest and try to have a sense of humor about what is otherwise a somewhat demented situation. I think we're all human, deep down we're all curious about other persons regardless of theirs or our marital status. And if the chemistry is there, well, don't try and get in the way of it. I'm not going to try and defend an affair, but I do belive it's a natural part of our animal nature and can add a little excitement and adventure to an otherwise pleasant life that is lacking in the random flirtation and experiences that can be such an exciting part of life. If you're capable of compartmentalizing and being equally intellectually honest, discrete and willing to take a bit of a leap of faith, I'd love to find someone to meet up with for a drink, some laughs, intelligent conversation and hopefully find a connection that helps take us to another level. I'm 33, very fit (but not a muscleman), and if you can convince me that I can trust you with a photo, I think you'll find that I'm quite good looking! We live once, let's live it well.

I know you are out there, somewhere, leading your life. Shopping, cooking, dropping the kids off at school, just living. In the quiet moments of your day you wonder how you got to where you are and why, feeling there has to be more, knowing someone is out there, looking for you. You feel the emptiness. You love your family but something is missing. Deep, deep in you innermost being is an ember. The nucleus of a flame, a flame you dream of burning bright. But, it just smolders in your day to day existence. You need that man, the one to tend to it, to add the fuel, carefully, gently, expertly, and to blow that dying ember into first a flicker of a flame, then a steady fire, and finally a passionate conflagration that consumes all the daily drudgery of life.

It is fate that has brought you here. I have been searching for you for so long. A woman of depth, perception, intelligence, passion, romance. A woman to be friend, confidant, lover. Not wanting to change our lives but to add that missing piece, that spark, that connection, to form memories to last a lifetime. The adventure begins with just one email...

FAQ :
Let me answer some commonly asked questions. Yes, these are real questions. If you have another question just send it on in and if it is a good one it might even make the list.

Are you real? ""I think therefore I am?"" I think so.

Are you ugly? No. I have all my hair and all my teeth. I've been described as handsome.

What are your ""statistics?"": What? Do you plan to put me on your fantasy football team? Late 20's, white, male, employed, hazel and brown. 6'2"". Drug and disease free. No tattoos or piercings.

Do you have a problem with tattoos and piercings? Nope. But I don't have any because I'm afraid of needles.

How big is your member? Yes, someone really asked this. Let me say this: it works fine for me and no one has ever complained. Yes, it is circumcised and well tended. And, no I don't have any pictures of it to send to you. What kind of narcissist do you think I am?

Are you a ""psycho?"" Let me check with ""the voices"" and get back to you...

Are you kinky? I guess that depends on your definition of kinky. I mean, some people think woman-on-the-top and cunnilingus is kinky. I think of myself as adventurous and creative. On the other hand, if when you hear the word foreplay, your first thought is cattle prod you'd better move on.

Why don't you post a picture? Well, maybe I'm a vampire and I can't be photographed. How about discretion? Did you miss the part about my being married? Oh, maybe I haven't mentioned that yet! Anyway, I do have pictures, and I'll send a picture to you when I'm comfortable that I'm talking to a real woman that I'm attracted to. And you should have a picture too. You will have to reveal yourself at some point. But, nothing to fear, I am the soul of discretion.

Are you looking for a married woman? Why not a single one? Ok married or single!

How would you describe your ideal woman? Age 25-?. Under 5'9"" in her bare feet, petite, weighs less than me, well-groomed, takes regular showers or baths (and may even enjoy sharing them). Speaks with her eyes, warm, caring, open, curious, creative, perceptive, has a sense of humor. She is just fun to be with. Accepting: the kind of woman with whom you can share anything, hopes and dreams, fears and failures. Someone who has experienced life and is mature. She's not afraid to be herself. She is multifaceted, a precious diamond, but has some facets that she needs to share that cannot be seen or appreciated by others. Discreet.

Are looks important? Of course.

Why don't you find a woman at work? I'll be honest - there are certainly women at work I'd love to be with, but these days even hinting at something will get you a pink slip. I like my job. Now, if that babe down the hall stumbles on this ad...But what are the odds of that?

Why don't you pick up someone at a bar? Every time I meet someone at a bar they assume I'm single and run when they find out I'm not, and I really don't want to lie and start something under false pretenses.

Why didn't you respond to my ad? Well. I've been there, done that. Frankly, 99% of the ads are fake placed by spammers or else from some other site that just wants a credit card number to ""check out the profile."" I don't bother responding anymore unless there are local references or something to show that the ad might be for real.

Are you on drugs? Do the Viagra and Cialis count? Just joking. No, I don't use drugs.

Do you practice safe sex? Absolutely.

Why don't you just hire a professional? Because that is illegal. Duh. And, you can't have a friendship with a professional.

Are you really looking for just one woman? Yes. I want someone who is also looking for a regular steady friend and not just a one night stand.

Do you have references? You have got to be kidding. I've had enough experiences that I'm no novice, but I don't kiss and tell.

Are you good in bed? If you only knew.

With your career and life how will you have time for me? You can always make time for the people and things that are important.

When are you available? The best time for me is during the week after 5 or weekend evenings with advance planning.

Have you found someone yet? If you are reading this, no. Once I do this ad will be gone. But I have formed a few good relationships using this forum over the past few years. Each one of them fulfilling for both parties. I'll keep posting this occasionally until I do meet someone.

Why did you write so much? Because I'm not looking for just anyone so I'm being very specific. Now one women wrote to tell me I shouldn't write all this and that I should be more mysterious. Oh, let me assure you, there is plenty of mystery and excitement to come for that one exceptional woman.

Now you've read all the way through, get an anonymous email and write! What have you got to lose? If I bore you just delete it and go on with your life. But, imagine if, years from now, you look back at so many wonderful memories and you are so thankful that you took the chance. Everything to gain, nothing to lose. Reply with the name of your city in the subject line so I know you are real.

hello I am seeking an intelligent female friend with benefits someone who is smart and interesting enough to captivate my mind, who isn't afraid of physical intimacy from time to time, but ultimately understands i'm often busy and if i'm honest a little selfish so i don't have the time nor energy to devote to a full time relationship right now . 

I have a decent head on my shoulders, when i work on complex algorithms all day in computer languages all i want to do is be silly. I am a big kid in a lot of ways mainly my inquisitiveness and sense of curiosity, i think exploration (be it of another persons personality, mind, or body ) is fun and exciting i love discovering and probing those intimate unseen corners of a woman. I also enjoy discussing philosophy, why blue is better than red, the decay of american society, the walking dead, Novels, and what i had for breakfast this morning and why i wish it was instead what you had for breakfast this morning.

The kind of woman i am seeking is any age , body type , ethnicity, or personality type what i can't budge on is intelligence...not necessarily book smarts because i know a lot of idiots with a ton of certifications, degrees, and diplomas . The intelligence which attracts me is deep understanding and the ability to both communicate your thoughts , receive mine, and well basically have a simple understanding of how conversations work lol. Don't need geniuses someone whose brain i can pick and shamelessly flirt with over wine would be perfect. Know that above all i know what a friend is so if nothing else you have an eternal cheerleader and supporter in me .....it's just maybe we kiss sometimes . Not looking for anything heavy it's just sometimes i want someone to entertain and be entertained by.

Things i would like to enjoy with my FWB:

-Shameless flirting over wine/ beer at a bar
-Silly night time phone calls where we trade secrets and hilarious stories about how weird and awkward we can be( i know you have at least one story :-) )
-Kissing, licking,biting, touching, sucking...... Possible spanking? And above all cuddling.
-possible date stuff movies, dinner, random outings

So if you're an intelligent woman who is ok with being close , enjoying each others company, and not necessarily belonging to each other but are interested i. The two of us enjoying each other. Please reach out to me and let's see what happens ? I truly look forward to hearing from you.

I'm definitely not your average Craigslist guy I don't think. I'm a witty, quite sarcastic, educated, professional Scotsman looking for an interesting woman for some no strings, one time or repeat, fun encounters.

I'm open to women of various ages, races, shapes, and I'm not concerned about your relationship status. As long as there's mutual respect for discretion, no drama, and open minds, I'll be happy.

I'm actually in a long term relationship, but have permission to play. So, tell me a little about yourself, and what you're looking for ideally. Pic for pic, but not a requirement that you go first.

Good day ladies,

Per the title of my posting, I'm looking for an attached, married unfulfilled/unsatisfied female to start an ongoing relationship with. Before you continue reading, there are few things you should know:

-if you are looking to change your situation, I'm not the guy, so please do not respond

-if you are not slender (under size 12 and that's pushing it), please do not respond

-if you are not attractive, clean, practice good hygiene, please do not respond.

So, with that out of the way, I'm looking for something very straight forward and uncomplicated. I want to meet with scheduling permitting and offer you what you might be missing in your current situation. I can be the shoulder to cry on, the helping hand you need, your naughty little secret and the guy that puts the fire back into your belly.

What I want from you is to use your body as I pleasure and send you back to him/her. I'll make sure I don't leave any marks, wink. This will be a respectful, fun and uncomplicated relationship. Your discretion is assured. We both get what we need from each other and call it the day until next time. I'm not looking for multiple women; I'm only interested in one but the right one. So if this appeals to you, send me a reply and tell me about yourself. I prefer someone local or with one hour of DC. Tell me what your needs are and what you are expecting with this relationship. As for myself, I'm an attractive executive just looking to take something that doesn't belong to me.

Please specify your situation in your subject line, for example if married, your subject line should be Married. I will not respond otherwise. Thanks for reading and I hope to meet me so we can fulfill each other.

I'm looking for a truly submissive female to have an ongoing thing with. I'm looking for a girl able to do all that is asked of her. She is very obedient and does as she is told. Failure to comply will be followed by strict and severe punishments. I'm open to train the willing girl wanting to explore her submissive side. I'm strict but gentle.

She is also very attractive, she can either be a power broker in her professional life or the hot but super shy librarian as long she submits herself to me willingly or unwillingly (with punishments as encouragement). All of her efforts will not be unnoticed. She will be spoiled and have her needs taken care of. I'm serious and willing to start with ASAP with the right girl.

What did I mean ""without benefits?"" I am in a long distance relationship with a lot of free time. I'm not lonely but do enjoy female company. I assure you I am a normal guy, healthcare professional with a Master's degree. I enjoy good conversation from politics to travel experiences. I have a big screen TV with a wide selection of DVDs. Have you seen the Jersey Boys movie? I was torn whether to post in this section or platonic section, so I chose this one to see if I receive legitimate replies. It's no surprise that most of the replies are phony. I have seen ads in the platonic section asking for or offering a non-sexual massage. I'm open to that too. I have a warm fireplace, a great outdoor Jacuzzi (bathing suits OK) and a variety of beverages, even water. If you enjoy cuddling with no expectations I'm open to that too, but it's your call. So the ""without benefits"" is intended to separate out this ad from the ""with benefits."" I understand if you a bit (or a lot) skeptical. I would be glad to meet for coffee prior to the ""without benefits.""

In addition to the essential chemistry between two people, there is the added complication of trust and motive. Can I trust the guy I want to have an affair with? And why does he want an affair?

As a busy City executive, I have sufficient flexibility over my diary to be able to meet sometimes during the day, evening or weekends to hopefully fit in with your hectic diary.

As for me, I am in my early 50s, reasonably fit for my age with a broad range of interests and a desire to seek new experiences.

I want to have an affair with a married woman - a woman who is happy with her life, but just wants to regularly explore her desires and have some extramarital fun. I just want to enhance your life.

The bottom line is, I don't want to have to worry about whether or not we are going to fall in love - because we're not. I don't want to have the ""relationship conversation"" - because we already know. I like the boundaries. I just want to be intimate with reckless abandon. Your pleasure will be my top priority.

I'd love to say that life is the best that it can be. It's great, work is good and I enjoy my job. I have great friends and family that I can rely on. I'm just missing that last romantic aspect of my life to pull it all together. Kind of that missing piece to the puzzle. Maybe I'll have some luck here.

I would like to meet someone that has similar interests. I'm a 30 year old, professional, white soldier. I am seeking something with good potential for a friendship/relationship at the moment. I think that a woman I can connect with and be good friends with will eventually lead to something more substantial and ultimately a good intimate relationship in the future. I tend to click with intelligent women and women that are goal oriented. I would say I am an old fashioned guy. I was probably born after my time lol. I am a very open minded guy that likes to be able to take varied approaches. I am very adaptable to other people's personalities and values. I have no problem with people of all different backgrounds and styles and love to meet new people. 

I am intellectual (working on my MBA) and a hard worker. I have traveled a bit with the military, done my duty in Iraq and found myself back behind a desk. I also cannot say I don't like it. I am a paralegal for the Army and tend to enjoy matters of the law. I am also a drama free person. I am very middle of the road politics and spiritually. I have a big place in my heart for my friends and family. I am a huge sports/music/movie buff and I like to get out of the house often.

If we're comfortable with each other we can hold hands as we find a secluded place to snuggle, cuddle, kiss and do what teenagers do. I want to hug and hold. To be hugged and held. To kiss and be kissed. But, I want to be the shy and inexperienced one and you the assertive one.

You know that I want to kiss you but I'm shy and inexperienced with girls. You let me know it's ok and show me how to kiss you the way you want to be kissed, softly, slowly, gently and where did that tongue come from. You take my hand and guide it over your body showing me how you want to be caressed. I get to eager. You slow me down. You tell me it's not a race. Each part of the body's to be a savored and enjoyed like it's the only part. The lips, neck, breast, nipples, feet, legs and buns all to be slowly explored and enjoyed. This can all be done over clothes or if I'm lucky I'll get to your bra. Maybe ""accidentally"" I'll get a peak at your panties and see they're not black. 

You tease and flirt with me. Take it where you want and only as far as you want. There will be another time (lots more I hope) as we kiss good night and I walk away on cloud 9. You smile as you close the door knowing that I'll be dreaming about you tonight and tomorrow. And I hope you won't be able to get me out of your head and heart.

You're a smart, strong, amazing woman who wouldn't consider a relationship where your needs didn't come first.

I'm fit, tall, single, professional, educated and considered very cute according to women friends. I'm deferential by nature though have a strong alpha exterior. I'm a great catch. Meeting women has never been a problem; meeting a woman who responds and appreciates my gift of obedience has been a bit of a struggle. Please be fit, professional, educated, strong, serious and sincere. 

I approach this relationship dynamic with eyes wide open. I've been down this path before and understand what's involved in making a female-led relationship dynamic work. Please feel free to ask any questions. I'm looking for a proactive woman who is assertive in her approach. All I ask is you share my outlook and are a compatible partner with a wide variety of interests.

Recently separated dude looking for an amazing friend and partner. I am kind of a geek.. but love to laugh and have a really good time. Right now.. this ad just sucks.. lol.. I need to find out what I should write here.. So here is more about me.. :)

I work out 3 times a week, but I am not a health nut
I love to cook and make things from scratch, but I am not offended by ""junk food/fast food""
Most of my TV is watching cartoons or food network (The world is negative enough without watching the news and someone else making me feel bad)
I love doctor who and BSG.. but not a big star wars fan at all.
Yea to Marvel... no to DC..
I am a musical child of the late 80s (Hard rock/ ""Hair Metal"") but I still always look for new music (Check out Avantasia!!)
Life is about experiences and not about perception of others.. I never try and stand out, but I will not change who I am to fit a group if it doesn't feel correct.

I am not someone of faith, but I do not ever think that is it correct for anyone other than me.. ie.. I do not down talk, make fun of or have an intolerance for any other faiths.. Believe what you believe and be strong about it :)
I can be sarcastic and imposing, but I am really shy and afraid of judgements

I am looking for a friend, a partner in crime (not literally), someone to be myself with, and her be herself.. always..

Honestly is important.. No matter what and who you are.. own it.. 

I love the beach.. I feel like something is missing in my life if I do not see the ocean for a few days a year.

I was a fat guy.. but in the last year.. dropped around 80 lbs.. so now.. I look a lot better.. and I am still a work in progress.. I have a muscular build (no matter how slim I get.. chances of me shopping at Banana Republic are slim).

What else do you want to know? Please feel free and ask.. I am an open book..

Do you miss the feeling of someone who appreciates your body and someone who wants to please you? Are you missing that feeling of someone who can make you excited at the thought of meeting up?

I am a SWM who's seeking a regular meet up with a sexy, sensual, and sexual single Ebony woman. I am open to whatever it is you would like to explore with me. Your pleasure and well being comes first, not mine.

Physically I am height and weight proportionate, d&d; free, I do not smoke, and I was not beaten with a rake in terms of physical looks.

If you're interested I'd love to chat to see if we're a good match. Please, do not ask for a picture unless you have sent yours first. I'm asking that you be height and weight proportionate as well.

Thanks for taking a moment to read my post.

I'm a divorced, professional white male. I'm financially secure and have a great job. What I'm missing is a partner to spend time with. I'm pretty much an average, mid 50's guy who comes from a wonderful, loving, happy family. I enjoy spending time with my family, and I'm an avid golfer. I also enjoy card, video and board games.

I'm faithful, loving, love to hold hands, snuggle and kiss. I tend to be most attracted to older (60's and up), mature, white females who have thin to average builds. I'm okay with a few extra pounds but really have no attraction to those that may be heavier.

If you have any interest, send me a reply and we can discuss via email. If there is a comfort level achieved, we could possibly meet and go from there. Ideally, you would be nearby (Franconia, Huntington, Rose Hill area).

It would be wonderful to find someone to get to know and fall in love with.

Hope to hear from you soon.

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/nva/m4w/5422311981.html,Seek Mental and Physical Amazon Christian SBF,"
My title doesn't say it all but says a lot. 

I prefer a tall woman 5'10"" and up but not required. Me 6'2"" and over 50. 

I seek a smart and logical woman. Yes, logical at least most of the time understanding a woman of passion and emotions that shows she cares cannot always be logical/.

I only desire a woman who knows she is Blessed and the Lord is with her for the right reasons, who strives to give back as I do and who may have the open mind to embrace a shared Christian mission as my eventual partner.

As for SBF in the title, that is optional. Me, a SWM who has dated and interacted with all and have found a bit more likely that a SBF may be more open minded and down to earth than my beige counterparts.

I crave communication. Do you? If so, my post (and me) is as real as it gets so worth the effort.

I am a well-educated professional and am looking for similar. Please be ddf and a non smoker. I prefer younger, but am open to any masculine guys who are naturally submissive and very service-oriented. I am open to poppers but not much more. 

Please put the name of you preferred team in the ""Subject Line"" so I know you are for real.

I'm looking for something very specific. I'm not the kind of guy to mess around with a whole lot of guys. So I'm looking for a bottom that's looking to have a steady top friend swing by and pound that hole the way it's mean to be fucked. I'm pretty verbal and I enjoy playing the dominant role. Enjoy a bottom who's eager and willing to please his top guy. A bottom who doesn't mind spending sometime between a guys legs nourishing on his cock. I pre cum a lot and I also shoot a pretty big load. I enjoy watching a cute guy between my legs. Slapping my cock across his face and making him suck and choke on my thick cock. I love a moaner. A bottom that begs to be fed. Once my cock is nice and wet I would love to spin you around. . . Bend you over and stick my tongue deep in your hole. Spit in it and make it nice and wet. Stick a finger in and work it around opening you up as my cock twitches in anticipation. Make you spread your cheeks open and invite me into your hole, beg me to fuck you. Slide my cock deep in your hole. Slowly fucking you at first, picking up speed and holding on to your hips as I thrust myself in and out of your hole. Your moans escaping as I pound the fuck out of your hole. Flipping you into as many positions as I can so I can fuck every corner of your hole and hit every spot. I do enjoy some kink and would love to tie you up and blind fold you sometime. You must be descent looking and height and weight proportionate. I do enjoy other bears such as myself if you're well proportioned. I'm a 31 year old Latino, Bear type guy. Who stands at 5'8"", 210, Dark brown hair and eyes. I'm averagely endowed 6.5"" Uncut and pretty thick. I can go multiple times too if you're interested. You MUST host. Like I said I'm looking for a steady buddy who wouldn't mind having his hole fucked a few times a week. Safe play only. STD free here. 420 friendly. I'm in the Springfield area and would love to find a buddy close to me that's looking to have some hot fun.

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/nva/m4m/5426723938.html,Seeking an Uncomplicated Bromance...,"
This is a unique opportunity. I'm divorced from a woman. I'm a mature coat and tie professional. Silver hair. Six feet two. Two hundred and twenty pounds. I have adult children. I have tiny grandchildren. My kids all know I'm gay. No prob. I have a BF....who lives out of the area. We are quite serious and have discussed marriage...so emotionally things are progressing. Until he is able to relocate, we have given each other permission to play. I have a very strong drive. So, I'm looking to have a man to get naked with.

I have had FWBs that have lasted for years....but they have all relocated. So, my desire is to have a man that can deal with a true BROMANCE with great sex....regularly. Not wanting miscellaneous hookups with the multitudes. 

My one desire in placing this ad is to meet ONE good man. He can be married....identify as straight.....identify as bi....or curious. But he has to have an equally strong sex drive and is interested in exploring and experiencing man on man intimacy. We can also explore activities beyond the bedroom if you have time to fit it into your schedule.

Totally open to a full bromance. Hanging out....having fun....lots of interests...experiencing the joys of m2m sex....exploring what men can do with each other: positions....touching....kissing......licking.....massage.....cuddling......rimming.....prostate massage, etc. I want a man who will let go and allow me to let go so that we can learn to be better lovers. I have a strong interest in sex....and an equally strong drive. I have a desire to make my sex partner feel like the Lord of the Universe.

So, if you are curious....or bi......or straight.....or just horny......I am your perfect opportunity. 

Not going to complicate your life.....will not be clingy......will not try to replace your primary relationship -- if any....

You get extra points if you're law enforcement, military, clergy, ....square jawed....well built and sincere. Moderately hairy chest......smooth butt. I'm mature...which means that I have a regular build....naturally nice looking.....nice chest.....smooth and tight butt.....strong legs.... Not into chubs or fems (sorry.). Also strongly attracted to caucasians. (sorry). I'm no twink or gym rat. So if you can deal with a real guy.....not some sort of fantasy man.... I am bottom oriented. You should be a total top.

I may be just what you're looking for.

I promise to be totally discreet. It will be our secret. You won't be disappointed between the sheets.

You need to practice excellent hygiene.....ddf....smoke free....professional.....and know what you want -- like me.

This is a unique opportunity. I'm divorced from a woman. I'm a mature coat and tie professional. Silver hair. Six feet two. Two hundred and twenty pounds. I have adult children. I have tiny grandchildren. My kids all know I'm gay. No prob. I have a BF....who lives out of the area. We are quite serious and have discussed marriage...so emotionally things are progressing. Until he is able to relocate, we have given each other permission to play. I have a very strong drive. So, I'm looking to have a man to get naked with.

I have had FWBs that have lasted for years....but they have all relocated. So, my desire is to have a man that can deal with a true BROMANCE with great sex....regularly. Not wanting miscellaneous hookups with the multitudes. 

My one desire in placing this ad is to meet ONE good man. He can be married....identify as straight.....identify as bi....or curious. But he has to have an equally strong sex drive and is interested in exploring and experiencing man on man intimacy. We can also explore activities beyond the bedroom if you have time to fit it into your schedule.

Totally open to a full bromance. Hanging out....having fun....lots of interests...experiencing the joys of m2m sex....exploring what men can do with each other: positions....touching....kissing......licking.....massage.....cuddling......rimming.....prostate massage, etc. I want a man who will let go and allow me to let go so that we can learn to be better lovers. I have a strong interest in sex....and an equally strong drive. I have a desire to make my sex partner feel like the Lord of the Universe.

So, if you are curious....or bi......or straight.....or just horny......I am your perfect opportunity. 

Not going to complicate your life.....will not be clingy......will not try to replace your primary relationship -- if any....

You get extra points if you're law enforcement, military, clergy, ....square jawed....well built and sincere. Moderately hairy chest......smooth butt. I'm mature...which means that I have a regular build....naturally nice looking.....nice chest.....smooth and tight butt.....strong legs.... Not into chubs or fems (sorry.). Also strongly attracted to caucasians. (sorry). I'm no twink or gym rat. So if you can deal with a real guy.....not some sort of fantasy man.... I am bottom oriented. You should be a total top.

I may be just what you're looking for.

I promise to be totally discreet. It will be our secret. You won't be disappointed between the sheets.

You need to practice excellent hygiene.....ddf....smoke free....professional.....and know what you want -- like me.

I'm looking for a young woman who would be interested in mid-day museum explorations with an intelligent college instructor. A museum is often a catalyst for unusual conversation, and it can be a way for people who normally might not hang out together to share some time and some thoughts. And it's a place where a teacher and his young student may find themselves in a comfortable setting among strangers, where prying eyes don't care that his ring is hidden under the tentative clasp of her hand. One might even argue that what happens in the museum stays in the museum...

If you're occasionally free in the middle of the weekday when the museums are open, I'd love to hear from you.

Me: tall, fit, slender, blue eyes, brown hair with a hint of gray, mid-forties, well-dressed, well-read, incorrigible weakness for smart young women.
You: smart, sweet, a little shy, a hint of innocence, a distinct preference for intelligent older men.

Hello Ma'am:

I will try my best to get my thoughts through. I am Asian, bisexual, slim, clean and respectful. I am in college. In private, I like to wear panties, stocking, and night gown but no wigs or make up. I am not trying to be passable and I dont want to. I guess it all started when I was a little and stole my mom's panties to play with.

My fantasy is to find a mature lady (40+) who I will call MOM when we go out and in private and treat you as such. Race and weight is unimportant although I have a sweet spot for white BBW. The scene I'm looking for is that you come home and find out that I'm secretly try on your panties and dress and instead of scolding me, you embrace me and tell me I look cute in them. Then we kiss and one thing leads to another I'm sucking on your tits and pussy while still wearing my dress. If you have thought about shoving a dildo into a guy's ass, why not doing your son? :P

Sex is nice but I'd really love to find someone who wants to get into the role. So I can tell you about my day, clean your house, and help you when you're horny. We can go out as mother and son, take a bath together and even go lingerie shopping...etc

I know this is a long shot but I guess I'm gonna keep posting until I find someone. I am happy to send you my face pictures if you ask for it Mom. :)

Thank you for clicking on my post. I live in Toronto but I want to expand my search for the right guy. I am here to looking for the right guy to build a solid relationship with and hopefully settle down with.

Me: Real (very important), tall (for a women), attractive, totally passable, nice, a great relationship material, reliable, loyal, romantic, caring, serious when needed, but usually easy going and can crack (and take) jokes. Decent job, still ambitious, have my own place downtown. Also importantly, non-op and will stay this way, vers if this is also very important to you to know.

You: Know that you want to settle down with a non-op ts, serious, loyal, respectful, a big heart, well-educated, have your career and ambitious yet want your own out-of-work life and family-orientated. Physically, ideally taller than me, in-shape and have a nice smile, between 25 to 40 years young.

I am serious and don't want to waste anyone's time or mine, if you are just here for fun, please don't reply. I don't play games and don't play hard-to-get if I like someone. I prefer to be direct. If you are into such games, I won't be the right person for you.

If you like what you are reading and think you might be the guy, why don't you hit ""reply"" and tell me about yourself with a few pictures included? I am looking forward to hearing from you.

I know the feeling, But I got your attention so go ahead and read my entire post. I promise you everything I write here will be true... You just need to read it and then reply honestly if you truly feel we can share an adventure full of fun, passion, intimacy and intensity. The only thing I ask is that you read everything below, and if you reply, that you know what you are looking for and will communicate that. In return, I will do the same....honest :)

You are in a relationship, marriage or otherwise, that you now find boring and not fulfiling the needs and desires you truly believe you deserve. Bluntly put, you are not being satisfied and thus you are left with a sexual ""itch"" that is driving you crazy...which brings you here. We all wear several hats in our lives, be it wife, mother, friend, daughter.....but it is vital to your inner happinesss that you also act as a lover, and that you have a lover in your life for as long as you require. You want an intelligent, handsome, sensual man that can take you in his arms and then take you on the erotic journey that has been out of your reach for too long. You want both a friend and a sexual partner..yes a friend with benefits.. to experiment with, to have fun with and to stroke that fire burning inside you, not blow it out again. You are in your thirties to early fifties, healthy and consider yourself attractive. You are educated, discreet, and you know what you want. You like kissing, you like fondling, you are comfortable with your sexuality and either know how to express it or want a man to help bring it out of you.

I am a MWM who feels the same way you do and finally decided to do something about it, just like you. While multiple women will reply to this posting, I am really looking for just one. I am 6'2'' 195 pounds, good looking ( or so I assume when I get smiles from women while driving on 495) atheletic, (work out multiple times per week), have deep blue eyes, full lips, (do you like kissing>) strong shoulders (when was the last time you were carried across a hotel room) fun/funny and gentle fingers ( use your imagination). Yes, you will find me fun in and out of bed, not shy, adventurous and open minded. There has been a vacuum in my life for too long and I am taking action now, because just like you.. I deserve it. Kissing, licking, fucking, cumming, maybe even a bit of spanking :) ...these are not bad words, these are words and events both of us need more of in our lives. And is there any better word than orgasm, which I am guessing you might agree with!

So what are you going to do about it? There is so much more we can discuss, but this posting is simply an introduction. Write me and let's start a conversation. As I said, I am only looking for one woman....is it you? If you include a pic, I will do so as well when I wrote u back. 

To avoid the spam attack I got the first time I tried this, please include an adjective in the subject line of your reply, preferably one that describes you. And finally, the picture below, well, I just thought it was inspirational.

Explicitly open marriage here; could meet more than once if all three of us like each other. 

No hangups with race.

In the honest altruistic interest of saving all three of us time- 

I'm looking for an actual date, so it's way better to ask me what kind of food we could all enjoy together, than if I want to ""come over and fuck tonight."" 

I'm looking for nice people who know how to have an adult conversation. I hope you have had sober recurring conversation about adding a nice looking and polite guy to the bedroom. 

I especially like the three of us touching each other when we start making out. I like to whisper in his ear how great his wife's mouth tastes and let everyone's lips get acquainted. Frenching with a couple is so erotic - it's a great way to break through the ""friend zone"" into some very adult threesome fun. I'm never in a rush to get out of our clothes- that's where we're headed anyway, so why not enjoy the slow descent into bed?

For starters, I'm probably quite a bit older than you. For you, this is a bonus because you've discovered that you really like older men, but your parents might not share your opinion.

Then there's the fact that I don't shy away from public displays of affection. What would they think if, right in front of them, I grabbed you by the arm, pushed you up against a wall and kissed you passionately while boldly cupping your breast?

They also might not appreciate my uncensored tales of our sexual escapades. They might wince uncomfortably as I describe the wireless remote-control vibrator you like to wear when we go out on a date; the way you can barely keep a straight face when I activate it just as the waiter is about to take your order, or the way you giggle uncontrollably when I switch it on at a club just as you step out onto the dance floor.

They might not see the humor in my description of the cute little noises you make in your bedroom as my tongue slides wetly up and down the folds of your labia, gently teasing your sweet little rosebud, while my thumb is in your front hole and my index finger is up your rear.

They might not appreciate me telling them how much you love it when I tie you to my bed, on your back, naked, and spread-eagled. They might not enjoy hearing me describe how you like to stare at the ring on my finger as I thrust myself into you, thick and hard, over and over and over, in a syncopated rhythm against the backdrop of your screams; and how I like to stop every now and then and admire the way your pretty little body shakes uncontrollably as you try to catch your breath long enough to form the words, ""don't stop! oh, please don't stop!""

No, your parents wouldn't like me. Neither would your boyfriend. Although your best friend might find me intriguing. . .

I am a 30-year-old working in a professional field in downtown DC. I consider myself trans-amorous and I have dated both cis- and trans-gender women, so I'm not looking to fulfill a fetish.

I would like to meet a transgender woman on a date. My preferred woman would be someone I can converse with, doesn't do drugs, and is well educated (at least a bachelor's degree). I'd love to take her for coffee or dinner, see how we click, and enjoy doing stuff in the city. I'm very casual with seeing how things go; we can take it on a day to day basis with no expectations, and I wouldn't be closed to LTR if it's working out well.

Please include today's date in the subject line so I know you're not a spammer. Please tell me a bit about yourself.

I encourage you (but you don't have to) include a photograph so I can reciprocate. I promise to respond either way.

To prove I am real, we are facing a blizzard this weekend.

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/doc/msr/5433611937.html,The Professor in the Coffee Shop - m4w,"
There's this local independent coffee shop where you go when you want to catch up on a good book, do a little people watching, and maybe even get some work done. Lately, you've been noticing this man, probably in his mid 40s, who is sometimes there with a book, a kindle, or occasionally a laptop. He seems sort of mysterious but is attractive in a college-professor sort of way.

He's very tall and has light brown hair with just a hint of grey. Sometimes he keeps his hair short and spiky, but other times he lets it grow out long and thick. Right now it's fairly short. He has blue-gray eyes that somehow seem intelligent and caring, yet penetrating and intense. Like you, he's quite slender, and he looks very healthy. His hands are masculine yet soft, ""white collar"", and (like the rest of his body) they move slowly and gently.

You smiled at him once and he smiled back. He didn't say anything, though, and you noticed that he wears a ring on his finger, but you've tried not to think about that. Or more correctly, you've been thinking about it a lot. You're clearly younger than him, but you get the impression that he's used to that. He seems to have an air of quiet confidence that you really like, and you imagine that if he were to talk to you, he would look directly at you and really pay attention to what you were saying.

You also secretly wonder what he'd be like in bed. He looks fit, and he's clearly not inexperienced. He'd probably take the time to learn about your body and explore you slowly and deliberately--kissing, caressing, tasting, and teasing you until you could barely restrain yourself. He'd probably be thunderously hard and strong in the heat of the moment, yet amazingly gentle and sweet before and after--with dreamy cuddling, tender nibbles, and soft conversation.

But who exactly is this guy? Perhaps you should send him a note and see if he responds...

Well-maintained, smart, sometimes funny, fairly easy-on-the-eyes specimen with consummate on-time arrival and general life organizational skills seeks same . . . and yet not really, of course, because where's the fun in that?

My chemistry tends to combust more for younger men (I know, I know) who are mature beyond their years and enjoy keeping their somewhat senior crime partner on his toes. Late 30s through early 50s is often about right. It helps if you like roller coasters, dark foreign films, dive bars, and a bear hug before you head out the door in the morning. Even better if you want to take me on my first kayaking trip.

Interested in making a connection, dating, maybe even a LTR if it goes there. I enjoy a lot of things . . . travel, cooking, film, theater, hiking, road trips, good conversation over a drink or coffee to name a few.

I'm 58, five ten, one-sixty, a little furry, often scruffy, s/p/balding, ddf/hiv-, and a top mostly but then again ...

Do you want to find someone you trust and give yourself to them completely? Do you live for service, discipline, and control? Or are you just curious about it all?

I am seeking a male, sissy, or CD sub/slave/houseboy to serve me and my submissive girlfriend. I live in NOVA and Miss lives out of state. You would serve me primarily, so you must be willing/eager to serve a man. Age range 18-28. If you're much over 30, we're not likely to consider you. Bi, gay, or straight doesn't matter as long as you are willing to serve a man sexually and non-sexually and be teased by a young woman.

However, this is more than just sex. Ideally, we want a 24/7, full TPE slave experience--someone who will serve all of our needs. That means chores/housework, massages, errands, grooming, BDSM, and sex. (You must be willing to serve both a man and woman sexually). Limits will be respected, though, and we are open to discussing different options. A live-in slave would be best, but it's not required.

I will treat my slave well, though I will be strict. I am not a sadist unless you're a masochist (though spankings will be had for all). I believe it's a Master's responsibility to ensure his slave's well-being. I am ddf and expect you to be, too.

Experience not necessary; we will train. All that's needed is the proper attitude and a desire to give yourself to someone to do with as they please. 

Master is 48 and Miss is 23.

Please include age and stats in reply, along with a brief description of your situation, whatever that may be.

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/doc/msr/5432559998.html,A New Erotic Social Club: Seeking Co-Founder - m4w,"
Hi ladies,

You probably saw my post in the past. I have a couple ladies not believe I am real. I am willing to meet up with you and talk and chat over the phone. I am very real. I have decided to do a more informative ad. I am seeking an energetic lady to help me start an exclusive unique erotic masturbation club here in the Washington D.C. area. Before I tell you about the club, I just want you to know that I am very serious about this concept. There is nothing like this in this area. That is why I have been extremely picky with potential members and a female partner to help me get this club off the ground.

Things you should know about this social club concept:

Exclusive
If you have ever wanted to join an exclusive organization where you feel like a true member of a secret society, then look no further.
An erotic social club where new members are recruited and vetted by a committee made up of current members.
An erotic social club that has ritual and structure. No more fly buy night jack off parties.
An erotic club that acts as a fraternal order.
An erotic club where the ratio of men to women is always 3 to five at events. You won't have to worry about crazy annoying guys demanding your attention.
All potential members must apply for membership and go through an extensive vetting process before they are allowed to join.

Purpose of club and concept (not a swing club)
This social club concept is not a swing club. In our society today, we have truly forgotten about experiencing the true joys of orgasm. Just as the ancients of India practiced Tantra to reach bliss, we will use some of the same concepts and rituals to do as they did.
This club concept is a fraternal order for the sexual elite, where members are vetted and must gain approval before they join.
This club concept is a coed masturbation club. This is more than a club for gentlemen who like to masturbate and for ladies that like to pleasure themselves. This concept is for those that want to learn more about masturbation and learn new techniques to help each other reach bliss.

Privacy
Are you in a current relationship and you have been dreaming of a safe environment that won't require intercourse, a place where you can explore your sexuality and truly experience bliss? Are you single and wishing you could explore your sexuality more, but have been afraid of having your identity found out, this organization concept might be perfect for you.
During all meetings and events members will be required to cover the faces and eyes with a masquerade mask to protect ones identity.
All members will use alias names for the organization. The only members that will ever know your true name is the members of the membership committee.
Visualize the movie ""Eyes Wide Shut"" minus the prostitution etc.

Activities within the society
Our secret society will function like any other association of likeminded people. With the main goal of sexual tantric education and arousal, we will have of course play events. But, there will be opportunities for members to get involved attend tantric classes and buy toys from organizations like Passion Parties and more.
Monthly themed masturbation events
Monthly education event
Yearly retreat and annual meeting
Guest event (an event where guest can be invited)
Sex toy event
Masturbation and video event (Explaining the art of video and masturbation)
Joys of tantra and bliss.


Why I need you
As you can see, I have given this organization a lot of thought. I am also very serious about it. That is why I will keep this ad up until I find a lady who is serious and wants to help. I know from experience on CL that I can't pull this off as a single male. I need a female partner to help me make this organization a reality.

Is this the club for you?
I know what your thinking, Is this idea real and is this for me. If you fit any of the following, then I want to hear from you.
Love sex and masturbation
Intrigued and want to learn more about self pleasure
Love watching others get off
Love getting off yourself
Feel like you are a sex addict in some ways
Thought of going into porn or setting up a webcam. But, got scared because your identity will be out there.

If you could say to any of the above then do consider my club concept. Privacy and structure is what it will be all about.

For more details about the safest sex around, just send me a reply.

Please reply with the following:
State ""masturbation"" in the subject line so I can weed out spam
Age?
Are you single or attached?
Why you are interested?
Do you masturbate?
Please include a g rated pic of your face so I know you are real. You can send an x or rated picture as well. But, it is not necessary. I am not a pic collector. I will be happy to reply with one if you ask.

Please note: I have gotten a lot of replies. Please respond with a pic and more than one sentence to make yourself stand out. And No Men please you will get an invite later and I will not respond. Also if you are an escort or cam girl. Don't message me. I am not looking for you nor will I spend any money with you. Don't waist each others time.

You both must be comfortable with cuckolding, at ease with me verbally abusing hubby, ok with making hubby prepare her for me, and clean up. Hubby at a minimum should totally be submissive yet confident in his place in life. Lastly, both are professionals and require absolute discretion as I do. 

Don't be afraid to respond. Reply with ""Yours to Cuck"" and an email address. If we do connect, I prefer first meetings to be over coffee and conversation to ensure that there is a mental and physical connection initially.

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/doc/msr/5426275957.html,"Wanted: a girl who loves books, coffee shops, & intelligent older men - m4w","
I've always imagined that the quintessential forbidden affair between a younger woman and an older man should start in a used bookstore. Better yet, a used bookstore with a coffee shop. Does such a place even exist in the District? Well, as they say, a fantasy is a story that can occur only in your imagination.

I'm a part-time college instructor. Tall, lanky, forty-something. For the sake of this fantasy, you'd have to imagine me with dark-framed glasses, thick brown hair, a white dress shirt, open at the neck, a black corduroy blazer, dark jeans, and black leather shoes. And I'd be sitting in a comfortable chair in the aforementioned bookstore/cafe with a small pot of tea on the table next to me, reading something vaguely pretentious yet impossible to put down--perhaps something on the order of Gustave Flaubert, Anais Nin, or Vladimir Nabokov.

You would come around the corner from the stacks, engrossed in page three of a book you had just found, as you made your way somewhat absentmindedly to the cafe counter where you would look up from your book only just long enough to order something hot to drink.

Of course I would have looked up from my book the moment you came around the corner, and my eyes would have followed you as you moved across the room. I would be mesmerized by your beautiful yet no-nonsense appearance: your intelligent face, your slender build, your pretty hair arranged in a simple but practical way that speaks of care but not vanity. You would be quite a bit younger than me because that's the way it always is in the classic novels; and in contrast to me, you might not have a ring on your finger. Of course you'd have to be a lifelong lover of books, bookstores, and cozy coffee shops.

Your drink now in one hand, book in the other, you would scan the room, looking for a place to sit. Your eyes would meet mine, and we would both be briefly startled by the unexpected spark in each other's eyes. You would look away, slightly flustered, and you'd quickly find a seat on the opposite side of the room.

Nothing would happen for the next minute or so, during which we would pretend to be engrossed in our respective books. But after a while, we would begin to glance up periodically whenever we thought the other wasn't looking--plausibly disinterested, yet surreptitiously examining each other from afar. Inevitably, our glances would meet again, and this time just the hint of a smile would form on our lips.

But what then? Would one of us stand up and walk over to the other, or would it end up as yet another missed connection on craigslist? That would be a shame.

First, I am not looking for a bondage lover, there is no violence here or pain. I am looking for a woman who knows the difference between abused, and submissive. Who knows the need to simply surrender herself to one man to gain power by giving pleasure. I want a woman between the ages of 35 and 60. Who has submitted to another in the past, or who needs to learn the art of sensual submission. This is not a choice taken lightly, you must want this life style. We are not talking about redneck, head hung low beat into submission. I'm talking about a lifestyle that leads to both self pleasure and satisfaction. Only those who truly want this need apply, I am not looking for games. This is long term. I will train if you are positive you want this. Send a photo, your understanding of what YOU want and where you are. For those that become offended with this post and want to strike a blow for womanhood, I don't have the time and you will not get an answer from me. Just deleted.

Looking for a girl that's not too far gone yet in this screwed up society to realize that.
A good man provides for, nurtures and takes care of his girl, she comforts pleases and takes care of him.

In this day and age that's seen as dirty, outdated, and demeaning. 
Up is down, left is right, figuratively and literally. Its disgusting, and every little bit of destructive ""progress"" just brings men and women further apart. 

If your tired of that, and want something different, wanted to take your submissive side and have someone that would not only encourage it, but, embrace and treat it and you as the gem that you are, then your just the kind of girl that I'm looking for.

I'm successful, sweet, loving, affectionate and attentive. I need lots of affection and attention, and right away. If your looking to be wined and dined before you feel I'm ""worthy"" of your ""hidden treasures"" then your NOT my kinda girl. I want a girl thats going to want and appreciate me as much as i do her, and not play ""waiting"" games.

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/mld/msr/5410017497.html,Searching for Marry-Worthy Black or Afro-Latino Bottom - m4m,"
Let me straight honest, in my heart I want nothing more than to find someone to love, commit myself to, and be with until the day I die. I want to finally experience the elusive love that I have watched everyone around me attain; I've been so close, yet, I feel so removed from it. 

For the right person, I am willing to do whatever is necessary in order to meet him. If he lives on pluto, I will build a rocket, spend ten years flying there and ten back just to bring him here with me. I am posting across the country in hopes of finding someone who feels the same and is interested in exploring each other for the purposes of a relationship. I am a Christian, faithful, loving, caring, romantic, sweet, kind, honest, attractive, and giving man. 

If you could imagine how the perfect husband would act and treat you, it would be me. All my life, I have dreamed of finding that one guy who I could share my everything with and love forever. I know how silly this must sound, considering popular gay culture, but there must be at least one more out there like me. I know you're out there, and I'm waiting. 

I'm a graduate student, heading into a great profession. I am educated, financially stable, with my own place and my own vehicle. I don't mind if you aren't as ""set"" as I am, what I care about is our connection. 

I want to meet someone who will give me the time to get to know him to see if he is the one. I thought at one point that love at first sight happens, but I've learned a lot about people and what love really is over the past couple of years. Love means giving up things you need for someone else's wants. Love means doing what's best for both of you. Love means you can't imagine your life without someone. 

Maybe you're just like me, you desire that one person who will cherish you for the rest of your life. Do you fantasize about that one guy who will hold you throughout the night, waking up to make sure you are pressed tightly against him and that you're safe? He would hold your hand all the time, take you on the best dates, and make you wonder where in the hell he has been your entire life. He would grasp you in ways that make you feel alive and show you how much you are wanted and needed. 

He would come to your rescue when you need him and show you everyday he is worthy and deserving of your entire heart and all of your devotion. I am that guy. I dream about doing all of those things for someone. It's the thing I desire most on this planet. I'm tired of only imagining my fairytale, I'm ready to live it. 

I know if you have read this far that you are wondering what I look like and what I like. . . right? Well, I am of average height (5'10""), I am burley, but I carry my weight well, very attractive, of mixed race, although I essentially am (look) white. I am a top and tend to fill the more classic ""guy"" role in a relationship. 

I also have an inclination to gravitate more towards black men who are shorter, thinner, and hairless, but my tendencies are in no way reflective of any ""absolutes"" placed on the guys I want to meet, but I will be as honest as possible and tell you that I find it highly unlikely that I will find someone who isn't black attractive. Furthermore, ideally I would prefer someone who is a virgin or has a minimal number of sexual partners. 

I must be completely honest when I say I have been hurt before. I have never experienced what one would call a ""good"" relationship. I have had my heart trampled on and beaten until I thought it wouldn't be able to recover. I have everything I want besides this. It pains me a lot to experience each day alone and without the love I am so tirelessly praying for. I am hoping that the one guy, just one, in all of this nation, will see me and love me. I am hoping that he will finally provide me with the security and love I need to reach my true self. When I am with someone who gives me the love, attention, and security that I have never had, I have the potential to be everything you could ever want, hope for, and dream about. I am still trying to get over the past, but I need someone to show me what love should be so I can finally let go of it and experience all that love has to offer. 

Maybe I want too much from a man, but I feel like I deserve it. Guys fear commitment, love, everything having to do with getting close to another human. Love isn't logical and doesn't follow anything else. In fact, it goes against biology completely, but I believe that when I find mine, he will know me when he sees me- he will be ready to love me in my entirety and give me all of his heart. 


***********************************
IMPORTANT:
All I ask is that you be CHRISTIAN, disease free, do NOT use any drugs (including cigarettes), in your 20s/VERY early 30s, a BOTTOM (not vers, not top, not Vers/bttm, a BOTTOM), and willing to RELOCATE eventually if we decide to pursue something (not right away, obviously). Make sure that you are ready to actually get to know me. I want to be able to share my all with someone. I want to be able to share my emotions, my desires, and fears without being fearful of being left. I don't want to be shunned for being human. I want to be loved for me instead of the person I can pretend to be. 

Include something about yourself, a photo, and your number. Be serious about wanting to get to know me. I don't want to waste anyone's time, nor have my time wasted. I prefer to talk via text or voice instead of email. I want someone who will maintain communication with me. Yes, we all get busy, but I don't want someone I have to chase in order to talk to them. 

And yes, I do have a photo, I just chose not to put it up because of my professional obligations. I am more than happy to share one with you by text. And I promise, I'm very handsome.

PLEASE, DO NOT CONTACT ME WITH HATEFUL THINGS, CRITIQUES OF MY POSTING, OR, OTHERWISE, ANYTHING BESIDES A GENUINE INTEREST IN GETTING TO KNOW ME. LASTLY, IF YOU CONTACT ME AND SAY SIMPLY ""PIC"" OR GIVE ME NO INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF, I WILL JUST IGNORE YOUR EMAIL. IF YOU ARE SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN GETTING TO KNOW ME, THE PERSON, APPROACH ME LIKE YOU ARE, NOT LIKE THIS IS A HOOK UP.

I'm hoping to find someone to keep me company at the pool, swim some laps together, and flirt a bit in the hot tub afterward. I'm 45, a good swimmer, slim and fit, and I'm fairly diligent about going to the pool at least once a week; but it would be much more fun to go with someone else--especially if you're sweet, friendly, and you look cute in a swimsuit. I used to have a swimming buddy, but she changed jobs and it isn't convenient for her anymore; so I've been going by myself lately, and it's not nearly as much fun. I have a flexible schedule and can usually make time throughout the day or evening with enough notice, and most of the Fairfax County indoor pools are convenient for me. If you're interested, let me know, and we'll figure out where and when. I don't mind if you're married or otherwise attached, as long as you don't mind the same about me. What happens at the pool stays at the pool :)

I know I'm looking for a needle in a haystack here, but I also know you're out there somewhere! And, I've actually gotten to know some very nice people through CL, so - while I haven't found you yet - it's not all been bad.

I am an in-shape and easy going, very fit white male seeking to meet a passable lady for drinks, dinner, friendship and fun on a long term basis. I am seeking both a friend and (hopefully) a lover. I am most attracted to slim or athletic younger white, Asian or Latina girls, but age isn't a showstopper. I especially love it if you are educated, sophisticated and nice. Please be nice.

First, I am married. It's a long story, but it is without drama and I have a flexible schedule. More over a cocktail if you're so inclined.

I am 55, an athletic, professional, suit type, clean cut, masculine, educated, travelled and very, very well mannered. I lift weights, run and bike 5+ days a week. I am 6'2"", one eighty eight pounds, 32 waist. 

In addition to meeting for drinks and dinner, I enjoy great conversation -- talking shop (yours and mine), solving the world's problems, current events, hobbies, our dreams and our histories. Snuggling on the couch with a glass of wine and watching NCIS can also make for a wonderful evening! Working out, running, hiking, beaches and boating are also all things I'd love to do with great company.

In private, I am very affectionate and attentive, and very, very oral. I love to snuggle and kiss, too. I am more bottom than verse, so please be ok with that. I am hugely turned on by thigh-highs, short skirts (with the legs to go with them) and heels. Not slutty, just sexy.

I am d/d free, a non-smoker, have great hygiene and discreet. I hope you are all of these, too.

Please drop me a well-considered note and let's hang out, have a couple drinks and laughs, and a wonderful time together! I'm happy to swap face pics with you if you're interested.

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/mld/msr/5435931378.html,Being Ignored During Football Season? - m4w,"
Although I probably won't be so fortunate this year, it is generally a good year when I don't know who won the Super Bowl (and a great one if I don't even know who played), as that usually happens when I have so many interesting things going on that I'm not even hearing or reading the sort of ""news"" reports which somehow consider oversized, steroid-sucking, semi-literates playing a game, as being newsworthy, and/or I am in someplace far away from the sort of people who consider football and other sports important.

Are you a woman who has reached your limit with a boyfriend or husband who pays more attention to football on TV than he does to you; caring, and getting far more excited, about sports than he does about the woman in his life? Do you wish for a partner who, while being very fit and athletic, isn't at all interested in organized sports, much less spectator ones, and, rather, is oriented toward doing real and productive things? Would you like someone who can talk knowledgeably and insightfully about a wide range of subjects, rather than just about sports and/or perhaps occasionally repeat some opinion on current events read in the paper or heard on a talk show? Would it be nice to have someone who has interests that overlap more with yours? Do you long for a man who is interested in what you think, and feel, and have to say? Can you imagine yourself getting wonderfully sensual massages from a tall, lean, attractive, romantic SWM, that go on for as long as the typical Super Bowl game does? 

If so, this might be a good time to consider finding a partner better suited to your needs and desires; one like me, who thinks that football is inane. You do need to realize that the sort of man who is more interested in his partner and in doing real things together with her, than in things like watching sports, is going to be seeking a woman who is likewise interested in her partner and doing real things, rather than her being obsessed with the fantasies of movies, theater, etc. And as someone who is going to take a real interest in, and pay much attention to , my partner, I do need her to have an aesthetically pleasing appearance, with the primary, and about the only absolute, criterion in that respect being that she be in the slender to average range. I'm obviously looking for a woman who has matured intellectually and emotionally, so her age will probably be above 40 with no definite upper limit. 

If what I've said here describes you and what you are seeking, I'd like to hear from you.

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/mld/msr/5413573340.html,Incredible massage evenings for you and a friend - m4ww,"
Would you and your best friend enjoy evenings of getting great massages while you relax and talk as you usually do? It would be like indulging yourselves at a spa, except that you you'd be in the comfort and privacy of home where you could have a couple or more glasses of wine, or drinks, without having to worry about driving, and be more open and humorous in your conversation than you could be around strangers at a spa. 

Would it be even better if the masseur was an intelligent, articulate, attractive, fun male friend who could add a male presence and perspective to your evening? The evening would still be about you and your friend; you'd still have the same conversations and same good time together that you usually do, just with the added element of a guy who would be physically pampering the both of you while taking part in the evening of friendly conversation, relaxation, and playfulness. The two of you would be able to gang up on him in any lively discussions where female and male opinions diverged, and you'd be able to verbally tease him in the way that is easy to do when the odds are in the women's favor. And, after the evenings of conversation and massages..? 

I'm a tall, lean, good looking, SWM, over 40, with an exceptionally wide range of knowledge and talents; among them, giving incredible massages. If two female friends would like some male company without giving up their time together (the way friends unfortunately usually end up doing when one or both get involved in typical individual relationships), the above described sort of relationship could work out ideally for all concerned. Of course, like any other relationship, it would require getting to know each other and finding whether there is mutual attraction. Although very intense in some ways, I'm generally very easy-going and laid back. So, if you and a friend would like to consider such a relationship, yet are a bit unsure about it, I'm very willing for us to first get to know each other as friends. Then, if we decide to go forward, we can explore slowly in a totally fun and lighthearted way with no particular expectations, other than giving the two of you an enjoyable spa-type evening of massages with some conversation and perhaps a bit of flirting and teasing. If the idea intrigues you and a friend, I'd like to hear from you.

Do you feel a warm tingle inside you when you accidentally discover a girl in a parked car whose head is bobbing up and down in her boyfriend's lap?

Do you stop and listen with a hint of jealousy when you hear a young woman having an orgasm from an open window as you walk across a college campus on a Sunday morning?

Do you secretly wish that someone would take you to one of those kinky clubs where see-through tops, pantiless limbo contests, and couples fondling each other are the norm?

Perhaps you're shy. Perhaps you're young. Perhaps you're just waiting for a tall, attractive, confident man who would like to help corrupt you. 

Perhaps you should reply to this ad.

Both in great shape ( as in right now, not like 5 years ago, or sometime in the future) We are laid back, educated, and creative.

This is for more than just intimacy. For more clarity, refer to the movie, ""Savages"", as it is an excellent depiction of the type of connection we seek. We are looking for a friend that will enjoy hanging out, museums, sports bars, wineries, cozy dinners at home all three of us, or just watching the game (with me serving drinks naked). If you are over 40, like the idea of being a part of a couple, enjoy spanking and some discipline of a willing adult girl, and having the balance of a masculine presence in the mix.

I'd be more comfortable meeting in a public place to see if there is any mutual interest. If there is, I don't want to waste too much time. 
No age limits but 30s to 60s preferred but younger/older okay. No reason to ruin a good thing with an arbitrary rule. The same applies to race so black-White men are welcome. 
Sex would be great but it would be better if I had something in common with the other man involved. We can talk about common interests. 
I'm a little on the chubby side at 5'5"" and about 316 lbs. 

I'm open to many things. If you are uninterested in something long term NSA is fine. If it works, a LTR would be fine. My preference is for someone I could see regularly. 

THINGS TO REMEMBER: 
I am open to partnered couples if both want to top me. 
All races are fine.

You must enjoy giving head, as she gets very turned on at the thought of seeing another woman suck me. We have had a few MFM threesomes and now want a FMF or MFMF. We are clean and 100% DDF. You must be too as we don't intend to use condoms. She loves cum. You don't need to be bi, but I'd love her tongue getting you off as you give head or to sit and watch you two 69. We are flexible. We host. Daytime or weekend daytime would be easiest, but again we are flexible. In the Dulles area. Not interested in hookers or pay to play crap. Pictures will be required before we meet and we will send pics too. It's all about fun and pleasure. We are both 55. A little extra weight but not at all sloppy.

I hole your head in my hands, make you look me in the eyes as he fucks you with his 9+ thick rod. I ask you if you like Daddy's gift tonight. You say yes Daddy and I tell my buddy to fuck you harder. You thank Daddy and I hold you in my arms as he fucks you for another fifteen minutes. That's my good girl.

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/nva/cas/5429407943.html,Yoni Massage - m4w,"
Below is an account of what you can experience for free. Massages are 1-3 hours and they are very discreet. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Special options available and requests are considered. Woman Only please. 

""I arrived right on time and although will confess to some nervousness, my momentary anxiety was abated when the door opened to reveal my guide's open arms and welcoming smile. We began our meeting with wine and conversation. Taking the edge off with about 15 minutes of initial ""getting to know you"" pleasantries, before the subject actually drifted toward my purpose in being there. Again I was given the opportunity to express the nature of my interest and expectations. Satisfied that I had made the right decision, I accepted my guide's offer to tour his beautiful space.

Beginning at my shoulders, my guide applied lavish quantities of oil upon my body. My guide's hands then rubbed along my back, sides and up toward the sides of my breasts. With my hands extended over my head, I found myself anticipating more. Soon, I found myself crying silently for more. How rich an experience it was to realize all that I needed was to relax and enjoy the ecstasy of this exquisite touch.

Eventually it became time to remove the solitary towel, my body now crying out for exploration. As if reading my mind my guide's well-oiled hands began to stroke along my buttocks; exploring up and down the crease; moving from my labia to my rosebud. Occasionally my guide would grasp my labial lips, holding them for a prolonged moment. This was an extremely sensual experience and I found myself reflexively arching my back to allow better access to my clit. I was left breathless and in ecstasy, a word I find myself repeating over and over again to describe this experience.

By now, my guide's fingers had made it to most of the intimate parts of my body. Simultaneously massaging my clitoris, one finger firmly atop my rosebud, with another inserted into my Yoni. Soon, I was ""riding the wave"" of back-to-back orgasms. Knowing that I was completely in my guide's hands, literally and figuratively, allowing full access to wherever these intuitive and talented fingers were being guided. Amazingly, at that moment, I did not hesitate or feel reluctant for all of my body to be explored. My entire body now writhed and quivered uncontrollably as my buttocks thrust in the air, over and over again. I had relinquished control, and it was wonderful.

Just as I thought that there was no more to be done, I was given the opportunity to rest. Having caught my breath, my guide helped me to roll over and onto my back. Then, just as before, a towel was placed across my midsection. At this point, with little inhibition, I secretly hoped that it would soon be removed. I now found it difficult to restrain myself, in anticipation of again being complete nude and unencumbered.

Mercifully, I would not have to wait for long, as my guide began to massage my breasts, then my inner thigh. Removing the towel now exposed my smooth and freshly waxed private area. Including my swollen clitoris, which now presented itself for attention. And it did receive attention, as did my labia, Yoni and clit. It was explored as I quivered over and over again. My release felt endless as my guide and I came together to understand my body. It was stunning to know that after 40 years on this planet so much could be revealed to me about the inner workings of my physical being.

I was exhausted and invigorated all at the same time. I would sleep well that night, awaking the following morning with a feeling of clarity and creativity that can only be found when the body and mind and truly cleansed.

During the days, which followed, I found myself looking back on that evening with a sense of memory that would previously have been unimaginable. Simply recalling the moment had made my chest tight, nipples swell and breathing deepen. The experience has opened my eyes and my body to a new level of being and I will forever be changed by the experience. I hope this expresses to others the special gift you offer. Thank you again.""

Nothing like the feel of a tight juicy pussy squeezing and clenching down as a girl cums hard from feeling the head of my cock press and pound against her cervix. My bare thick cock stretching her out, letting her know that I'm about to cum only to have her wrap her legs around my waist and beg for me to shoot it inside her. Not knowing if she's on birth control or not and unable to pull out, I drive myself deep inside her to the hilt as my cock blasts a large hot load of cum right against her cervix. Pounding away as we cum again and again, telling her about how I plan to shoot every drop of cum inside her womb, and she better hope her birth control works, my words only causing her to cum again. Both of us turned on at the prospect of me impregnating/breeding her, looking forward to have her bouncing on my cock, deep inside her pregnant pussy. My hands rubbing her swollen belly. Happily sucking her breasts and drinking her milk when she starts lactating...

Ah, nothing like pretending to do so, though I look forward to finding a woman who wants to be bred. If you're on birth control or you aren't and you're interested, be sure to let me know. Sadly I haven't gone raw and pumped my loads in a girl since an ex who loved it a few years ago.

You're a busy woman! Always on the go with that high tempo job, volunteering, probably school as well and perhaps yoga. 

You give and give and give. You give to your work, your education, your colleagues, family and friends. 

Therein lies your problem.

You don't have time for you!

You're working your tight little butt off for your future and don't see that you're passing it by every day you don't take time to stop and smell the roses.

Here is where I come in.

We'll meet at a little bistro (Old Town? Georgetown?) and we'll share some witty banter, nibbles and wine.

And once we're both relaxed and realize neither of us is an axe-murderer we can put our guards down and discuss the things that make us happy, and more importantly how to integrate those activities and goals within our lives.

If we click, then we make some plans to achieve them together.

Otherwise, you'll have a new insight into your happiness and maybe even a little motivation to get out of your daily grind.

This weekend would be nice as it is great to have a nice Sunday starting with brunch tomorrow morning and then hopefully some wine with you that afternoon.

If you do reply, who knows?

You came to DC for business and stayed in an executive apartment. I visited you. You spanked me and I sucked you and swallowed your load. We did this numerous times. The last time we met, we started with drinks at a bar then went to your place. You had me tie you up, spank you, fuck you and jack on your face. You told me to leave you like that so your friend with a key would find you bound and with cum on your face. I'd like to do this again and may be this time the friend would come back before I leave so I can see the reaction.
I remember your name and I am sure you remember mine so tell me the names when you hmu.

In the chair before me. Be yourself, I tell it.

Unchangeable: that shirt, those summer pants.

I think probably you won't read this. I've been trying to let it drop, but have been thinking about you now for a couple of months. You were really flirting with me, on the phone today. We've known each other for a few months and see each other maybe once a week. We are both single (I think, you don't wear a ring). I don't know how old you are but I would guess mid-thirties. I think you're beautiful. We work in different departments. I think, because of your position, you can't make any kind of moves, and it would be entirely up to me to make it happen. I don't see a way of getting to know you any better at work. Anything I could do to communicate my interest would have to occur in front of other people, because we are almost never alone together. It would be obvious and unprofessional for me to ask you about your personal life. I've been trying to hide it, but am convinced that you know that I'm attracted to you. You continue to flirt with me even though I have been trying to tone it down. I don't know what the policies are, but I think it's possible that it would be okay for us to date. I don't want to jeopardize either of our positions. If you are interested and available, I would like to spend time with you outside of work, to see if it could go anywhere. If you think this is for you, tell me what you were wearing the last time we spoke outdoors, and what we talked about. Tell me also what you said to me at the end of our phone call today. You might also tell me, when we last spoke in person.

This is a long shot.

Back in the late 70s, Paul lived off Plantation Parkway in Fairfax (it was his sister's house). 
He would also occasionally stay with his mom in Fairfax.
He went to Fairfax High School for awhile but did not graduate from there.
He hung out with some friends in Alexandria.
He was in the Army in late 70s. 

Paul had a lot of friends - maybe someone from here may remember him.

In a just world, no politician would leave office wealthier than on the day he takes the oath of office. We don't live in a just world, alas, and the rags-to-riches life stories of more than a few U.S. senators strain credulity.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, once an officer of the Capitol Police, joined the ranks of multimillionaires during his four decades on the public payroll. He says he's a good investor, and no doubt he is, but the watchdog group Cause of Action wants the Senate Ethics Committee to inquire as to whether and how he used his office to pad his campaign war chest.

The Senate's code of conduct stipulates that a senator may not ""permit any compensation to accrue to his beneficial interest"" as a result of ""influence improperly exerted from his position."" It prohibits petitioning executive branch agencies for financial benefit for the benefit of immediate family.

Cause of Action accuses Mr. Reid of attempting to influence the Obama administration to overrule career bureaucrats at the Department of Homeland Security to ""expedite"" visa applications for nearly two-dozen foreign nationals who were investors in a Nevada casino. Mr. Reid's son, Rory, was a lawyer for the casino.

The facts are clear enough. Career officials at the Department of Homeland Security turned down an expedited EB-5 visa application by the SLS Hotel & Casino in 2012 because agents were concerned over ""suspicious financial activity."" Mr. Reid called Alejandro Mayorkas, who was then the director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, to ask him to reverse the decision. Mr. Mayorkas cheerfully obliged.

Mr. Reid then changed Senate rules so that Mr. Mayorkas could be promoted to the No. 2 position at the Department of Homeland Security, even though he was the subject of an investigation by the inspector general.

In a letter to the ethics committee, citing an investigation by this newspaper, Daniel Z. Epstein, the executive director of Cause of Action, said, ""the American people deserve better. It is unfair for politicians to attempt to influence the enforcement of our laws, especially when they -- or their close family members -- stand to benefit.""

The EB-5 visa program grants temporary or permanent residence to foreigners who invest in a business in the United States. The program has tripled in size under Mr. Obama and essentially sells U.S. citizenship to the highest bidder. The scheme invites corruption.

Mr. Reid has a long history of scratching the backs of his friends. Green-energy companies that donated to Mr. Reid, including BrightSource Energy, Nevada Geothermal, Ormat Nevada and Solar Reserve, were then showered with taxpayer dollars.
Allegations of corruption in these cases are easily brushed aside since these companies are saving the planet by lowering the Earth's temperature. (Anyone who braves the below-zero wind chill to inspect the snowy landscape this week might say they've gone too far.)
Mr. Reid's intervention in this casino caper will be difficult for him to explain. It ought to be even more difficult for the Senate to ignore.

For the first time in my life, I am ashamed to be an American.

You can bash the Republican candidates all you want, but one day you will be begging for someone like Cruz to run for president. The United States has well over $250 trillion in debt and our economy and government WILL collapse. That is 100% guaranteed to happen. Not 99%, 100%. It is guaranteed to collapse due to Democrats being fiscally irresponsible. 90% of that debt can be traced back to a Democrat. People think Cruz is a radical, but even his plans do not take the US to a level of fiscal conservation necessary to prevent collapse. Government at all levels, Federal, state, county, and local, need to be cut by 40% right now and leave those cuts in place permanently. Anything less will not prevent collapse. 

It sounds like our nation must collapse before enough people realize we have been on the wrong path for a really long time. As bad as that current shit-stain in the White House has been, we will survive him. What will destroy the US is the stupidity of the people that voted for him. Twice.

roads that services horses and carriages were used by bicycles first then automobiles!


The controversy:
why would 150 year old churches with generations of attendees and participants of these community organizations be ""against"" having city public historical parking taken away for bicycle paths!?





Suprise answer!: 
because maybe bicyclists DON'T come first. (sorry white girl or beaded boy or manboy from the midwest who DONT take into account the neighborhoods they gentrified into. YES- YOURE WHITE; NOT FROM DC; LIVE IN SHAW? YOU GENTRIFIED INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD; ACCEPT REALITY. 
p.s. im white, so think of a new angle by which to attack me. 
AND from DC so YES you ARE a gentrifier in my native town. Just cause you look like me doesn't let your new concern trump a local road issue. welcome to dc. obey the rules.
bike lanes should come when everybody is ready for them and its for the GREATER good...NOT just ""yours"".

back to the point:
perhaps they can FINALLY after a HUNDRED YEARS, please admit they should know better by now and begin to take into consideration FINALLY community safety.
perhaps FINALLY after a hundred years FINALLY learn to incorporate themselves into road traffic without being d*cks, scofflaws and naive passive-aggressive blind asses.

BICYCLISTS:
go thru red light
go thru stop signs
turn without properly signaling either by hand or bike directional light.
obey the public road rules that they are required to by law-just as every automobile is required to obey.

ITS DC LAW.

The only reason the governor had to get involved is because the Democrats and EPA fucked it up to begin with. 

I 'get it'; Democrats could cause a 100 car pileup and if a Republican walks by the scene of the accident, he'd get blamed for it. 

Democrats own the water issues there 100%. I am hoping Hitler takes his own life. Twice.

===================================================================
""In a Democrat run city and in a water supply controlled by Hitlers EPA? Amazing. ""

Clearly you can't read but the Governor-appointed emergency manager made the decision to switch the water. Under MI law, when an emergency manager takes over, all locally-elected officials become figure heads and they have no authority (this is actually undemocratic and the law should be challenged in court). The emergency manager reports only to the governor.

And, btw, Hitler has been dead for a long, long time. Maybe you Republicans will all hold a moment of silence for him.

""But .............. you are a fucking amateur. If you can't get a 'blame Bush' or 'Fox News' in there, you are a fucking amateur. ""

No need to blame Bush; he had nothing to do with it. Fox probably misreports the facts. What's funny is you kids still try to blame Clinton for things and take credit for his successes.

2. Next, we require the newly un-insured to be re-insured.

3. To re-insure the newly un-insured, they are required to pay extra charges to be re- insured.

4. The extra charges are required so that the original insured, who became un-insured, and then became re-insured, can pay enough extra so that the original un-insured can be insured, so it will be 'free-of-charge' to them.

A 21-year-old Dearborn Heights man threatened terror attacks in support of ISIS with targets including police and a Detroit church with up to 6,000 members, according to a federal criminal complaint unsealed Thursday.

Khalil Abu-Rayyan, 21, has not been charged with any terrorism crime. In an affidavit filed in a criminal complaint on a weapons and marijuana charge, he's described as being an ISIS supporter who talked about committing violent acts of terrorism, including shootings and beheadings.

In his affidavit, FBI Special Agent Alan Southard said that Abu-Rayyan had been investigated by the FBI since May.

""Since May of 2015, the FBI has been conducting an investigation of Khalil Abu-Rayyan regarding increasingly violent threats he has made to others about committing acts of terror and martydom -- including brutal acts against police officers, churchgoers and others -- on behalf of the foreign terrorist organization Islamic State of Iraqi and Levant.""

DETROIT FREE PRESS

U.S.: Who's funding Dearborn cleric popular with ISIS?

A family member or attorney for Abu-Rayyan could not be reached late Friday. FBI Detroit spokeswoman Jill Washburn told the Free Press he is in custody and faces a detention hearing on Monday.

The FBI had been tracking Abu-Rayyan through social media, phone conversations, and surveillance. He had two Twitter accounts on which he expressed support for ISIS, the FBI said in the complaint.

According to the affidavit in the complaint, an undercover FBI employee was communicating with Abu-Rayyan. In December, the undercover FBI employee and Abu-Rayyan had ""daily conversations"" that took place ""over the course of several weeks,"" said the affidavit.

""During these conversations, Abu-Rayyan consistently expressed support for ISIL and repeatedly expressed his desire to commit a martyrdom operation.""

According to the affidavit, Abu-Rayyan also told the undercover FBI employee: ""I tried to shoot up a church one day. I don't know the name of it, but it's close to my job. It's one of the biggest ones in Detroit. Ya, I had it planned out. I bought a bunch of bullets. I practice a lot with it. I practice reloading and unloading. But my dad searched my car one day and he found everything. He found the gun and the bullets and a mask.""

""Abu-Rayyan said he targeted a church because, 'it's easy and a lot of people go there. Plus people are not allowed to carry guns in church. Plus, it would make the news. Everyone would've heard. Honestly, I regret not doing it. If I can't do jihad in the Middle East, I would do my jihad over here.""

The FBI said a church that has up to 6,000 members and fits the description given by Abu-Ryyan is about half a mile from where he works.

Abu-Ryyan said he didn't carry out the shooting because a gun he bought in October ""only held six shots and he would have to keep on reloading.""

Abu-Ryyan also took photos of himself at gun ranges firing an AK-47-type and AR-15-type rifles. He ""captioned one of the photos, 'Sawhat hunting,' "" said the affidavit.

""Sawhat is a term for Iraqis who oppose ISIL,"" said the affidavit.

On Oct. 7, Detroit Police had pulled over Abu-Ryyan for speeding, finding marijuana on him and a pistol. He told police he didn't have a concealed pistol license.

On Nov. 17, Wayne County prosecutors issued a warrant charging him with carrying a concealed weapon and possession of a controlled substance, marijuana.

On Jan. 15, he pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana. He faces a trial on Feb. 16 on the charge of carrying a concealed weapon.

On Jan. 21, he told the undercover FBI employee that ""he wanted to kill the officer who arrested him in October.""

He told the undercover FBI employee that his trial had been delayed because the officer who arrested him was in the hospital after suffering a heart attack.

""Abu-Rayyan explained he wanted to do a martyrdom operation in the hospital, killing the police officer in the process,"" said the affidavit.

On Jan. 22, he talked about having a large sword or knife in case he gets into a fight.

""Abu-Rayyan also said hearing about shootings and death makes him excited. He continued, 'I would gladly behead people if I needed to...It is my dream to behead someone.""

Dearborn attorney Majed Moughni, who often deals with Arab-American issues, said that what Abu-Rayyan was planning to do was ""terrifying ...Clearly terrorism is not a joking matter. ... Muslim Americans are working with law enforcement to stamp out threats to our community.""

On Nov. 17, Wayne County prosecutors issued a warrant charging him with carrying a concealed weapon and possession of a controlled substance, marijuana.

On Jan. 15, he pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana. He faces a trial on Feb. 16 on the charge of carrying a concealed weapon.

On Jan. 21, he told the undercover FBI employee that ""he wanted to kill the officer who arrested him in October.""

He told the undercover FBI employee that his trial had been delayed because the officer who arrested him was in the hospital after suffering a heart attack.

""Abu-Rayyan explained he wanted to do a martyrdom operation in the hospital, killing the police officer in the process,"" said the affidavit.

On Jan. 22, he talked about having a large sword or knife in case he gets into a fight.

""Abu-Rayyan also said hearing about shootings and death makes him excited. He continued, 'I would gladly behead people if I needed to...It is my dream to behead someone.""

Dearborn attorney Majed Moughni, who often deals with Arab-American issues, said that what Abu-Rayyan was planning to do was ""terrifying ...Clearly terrorism is not a joking matter. ... Muslim Americans are working with law enforcement to stamp out threats to our community.""

Watching the news and of course it is not news but typical election BS broadcasted over, and over and over...and over. Then, like a thunderbolt out of the blue, a word used by all the candidates bitch slapped me full force. That word is 'leader.' Those candidates accurately BELIEVE they are REAL leaders of people. When you think about it, is that not the funniest words you've ever heard spoken. Those scum couldn't lead a rat to cheese or a dung Beatle to a load of crap. No one respects any of them nor do their coercive rules, which they call laws, matter. Where I live we simply ignore their BS and there is nothing they can do about it.

But, what a good laugh it was to hear Jeb Bush calling himself a leader on one of those so called news programs this morning. As funny as one of those Clintion trash or Obama, or Cruz, or any of the other ones calling themselves a leader.

Does a disabled person who's a volunteer have a right to claim a desk in the front office space which is the only convenient space due to the desk being the appropriate height for the wheelchair? The disabled person is one of two people who volunteer as unpaid part-time counselors at a non-profit. They work at the nonprofit as part of a formal partnership agreement between the nonprofit and a counseling organization.

Desk space entails a work phone and file space at the desk.

The wheelchair user states that the back office room, which the nonprofit's director was thinking of giving to the two unpaid volunteer counselors while giving the front office space to her 2 employees, is too inconvenient because the wheelchair user is not able to move around without having to shift chairs around which is physically strenuous and understandably difficult. The front office has much more space.

The non-profit's director was thinking of giving the front desk to 2 staff employees who she pays as employees. However the disabled person is claiming the American Disabilities Act covers her right to a wheelchair accessible desk.

The disabled person sees it as an issue of ADA and a right to accommodation.

The nonprofit's director sees it as serving her paid employees first and not the volunteers. She doesn't see them as equal. 

Who's right?

I now hear my disabled friends claiming that we need marriage equality for disabled people. They specifically use the phrase marriage equality.

What they're seeking is getting rid of the ""marriage penalty"" that reduces disability payments (payments that are given to them from taxes, paid by hard working Americans) if they get married. The thinking behind that rule is that two people living under the same roof, married, share rent and utilities, and therefore shouldn't get two separate full disability checks.

What do you think of disabled people's hijacking of the marriage equality phrase? Gay people sincerely fought for specifically marriage equality--being able to even get married like their straight counterparts.

Disabled people's hijacking of the phrase rings hollow and selfish. They just want more money from hardworking taxpayers, even as they as disabled people themselves don't work and use taxpayers' money to go to movies, get tattoos, eat out.

Low Effort Thought Leads to Conservatism

We live in a complex world, and understanding this world requires complex thought. It would be easy to look at conservatives who think that all Muslims are terrorists or all Mexicans should ""go home"" and say that they're engaged in simplistic thought. Instead of making that assumption ourselves, though, let's look towards science.

Researchers over at the University of Arkansas released their study ""Low-Effort Thought Promotes Political Conservatism,"" and things started to make sense. They performed four different studies, all of which reduced subjects' ability to use ""effortful, deliberate thought,"" and they found that situations causing low-effort thought resulted in more conservative beliefs.

Heck, one of the studies found that, as an individual becomes more intoxicated on alcohol, their conservative beliefs increase. Which makes perfect sense, because if you ever saw me vote for Sarah Palin, you can rest assured that I'm drunk.

Housing, jobs in high-tax Connecticut could take hit in wake of GE move

General Electric's big move to Boston this summer could mean much more than leaving an empty corporate campus behind.

Residents and small business owners in the tony town of Fairfield, Conn. -- home to GE's global headquarters for more than four decades -- are bracing themselves for the collateral damage after the company announced last month it would be moving to Massachusetts and taking 800 jobs, millions in grants and opportunities for expansion with them. 

But that's not even the half of it.

The trickle-down devastation triggered by GE's move is predicted to spare no sector. The real estate market is expected to suffer as residents pick up and leave for better job prospects. Small businesses and infrastructure projects also could start to see setbacks in the near future, as the high taxes blamed in part for GE's move remain. 

""Probably half of the higher-end homes that used to house the GE executives will sit either unsold or foreclosed because no one else living in the area can afford them at their current price,"" Christopher Mills, president of C. Mills & Associates, which manages real estate portfolios nationwide, told FoxNews.com.

The last ACA co-op in America that was solvent and able to make ends without gigantic ""subsidies"" from the Government is now insolvent and losing millions each month. They are even now turning away individuals by the tens of thousands. And just WTF do those ""subsidies"" come from anyways? Taxes. So NO WONDER they are trying to crank the tax rates up with that going on!

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/doc/rnr/5435382003.html,Republican Lead Poisons Flint Residents,"
In a complicated story, due to Republican policy, the residents of Flint, Michigan cannot drink their city water. 

Serval years ago, the Republican-controlled Michigan Legislature passed a law allowing the governor to appoint an emergency manager to take over financially distressed cities. Flint was one of the cities. The emergency manager reports only to the governor and locally-elected officials have no power. Effectively the emergency manager rules by fiat and democratic government is suspended. 

The emergency manager in Flint, Michigan decided to switch the water supply from the City of Detroit to the Flint River. Once the water supply was switched, the pipe to Detroit was sold. The pH level in the Flint River was different than Detroit water, which came from the lake. The Flint Water also did not contain the chemicals to prevent the corrosion in the pipes. The untreated Flint River water caused corrosion in the pipes causing lead to seep into the water supply. 

The emergency manager was warned of this contingency and, as it turns out, the Flint River water was never treated properly.

In what was supposed to be a cost savings measure by switching the water suppy is now a Federal disaster. It will have cost many times more to deal with the fall out than if the city had continued to use Detroit water. The water pipes throughout the city will have to be replaced costing Billions of dollars, most of which the Federal government will end up paying for. 

Residents, including children have been exposed to lead; the health damages are irreversible. Residents can't drink the water and they rely entirely upon donations of bottled water just for minimal subsistence. Bathing is impossible. Residents still get water bills. 

The Michigan National Guard is assisting with the distribution of bottled water. Lawsuits will cost the state of Michigan billions of dollars in payouts. 

This is reminiscent of the Bush EPA, that wanted to raise arsenic levels in water in drinking water supplies. 

If you want to donate to Flint, the E Michigan Food Bank needs help. 

Over the past year, doctors warned of lead showing up in patient populations. When they raised alarms, the Snyder administration moved to discredit them rather than addressing the problem. Snyder also warned state workers in Flint of the water problem while simultaneously telling Flint residents the water was safe. 

Another Republican disaster.

http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/doc/rnr/5435158930.html,The real deal about Hillary,"
This has not been a good week for Hillary Clinton.

She prevailed over Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Iowa Democratic presidential caucuses by less than four tenths of one percent of all votes cast, after having led him in polls in Iowa at one time by 40 percentage points.

In her statement to supporters, standing in front of her gaunt and listless looking husband, she was not able to mouth the word ""victory"" or any of its standard variants. She could barely hide her contempt for the Iowa Democrats who disserted her.


Sanders isn't even a Democrat. According to official Senate records, he is an ""Independent Socialist"" who votes to organize the Senate with the Democrats, and sits on the Senate floor with them.

Clinton, of course, is the heiress to the mightiest Democratic political apparatus in the land. Hence the question: What do the Iowa Democrats know that caused thousands of them to flee from her?


They know she is a crook.


On the Friday before Monday's caucuses, the State Department, which Clinton headed in President Obama's first term, revealed that it discovered 22 top-secret emails on the private computer server to which Clinton diverted all her governmental email traffic. This acknowledgement marks a radical departure from previous State Department pronouncements and is a direct repudiation of Clinton's repeated assertions.


She has repeatedly asserted that she neither sent nor received anything ""marked classified"" using her private email server. The State Department, until last Friday, has backed that up by claiming that while the substance of at least 1,300 of her emails was confidential, secret or top secret, they were not ""marked"" as such when she dealt with them.


These are word games. First, under the law, nothing is ""marked classified."" The markings are ""confidential"" or ""secret"" or ""top secret,"" and Clinton knows this.

Second, under the law, it is not the markings on the email headers that make the contents state secrets; it is the vulnerability of the contents of the emails to impair the government's national security mission that rationally characterizes them as secrets.


Clinton knows this because she signed an oath on Jan. 22, 2009 recognizing that state secrets retain their secrecy status whether ""marked or unmarked"" by any of the secrecy designations. She knows as well that, under the law, the secretary of state is charged with knowing state secrets when she comes upon them.


Yet, in order to further Clinton's deceptive narrative, the State Department has consistently claimed that it retroactively marked at least 1,300 emails as state secrets. It did this until last Friday.


Last Friday, the State Department revealed that 22 emails it found on Clinton's private server were in fact top secret, and were in fact marked top secret, and were in fact sent to or received from President Obama. This is a revelation that substantially undermines Clinton's political arguments and is catastrophic to her legal position.


Politically, Clinton has lost the final argument in her public arsenal -- that she did not recognize top-secret data unless it was marked as top secret. She has also lost the ability to claim, as she has repeatedly, that she neither sent nor received anything marked classified, as meaningless as that phrase is.


Legally, the ground under Clinton continues to crumble. The more she denies, the more she admits. How can that be? That is so because her denials are essentially an admission of ignorance, forgetfulness or negligence, and, under the law, these are not defenses to the failure to safeguard state secrets entrusted to the secretary of state. They are, instead, recognition of that failure.


Late Monday afternoon, before the Iowa caucuses convened and after Clinton's political folks had lobbied their former colleagues at the State Department to re-characterize what they found and revealed late last week, the State Department reversed itself and claimed that the 22 emails were not ""marked"" top secret.

It was too little and too late. The cat was out of the bag and Iowa Democrats knew it.

Few really believed that the State Department would state publicly that the 22 emails were top secret and then state publicly that they were not, without a political motivation and irrespective of the truth. All this is infuriating to the FBI, which perceives these word games as mocking its fidelity to the rule of law.


Sanders' presence in the Democratic primaries will continue to give Democrats who mistrust Clinton a safe political haven. But he is not Clinton's real worry.

Her real worry is an FBI committed to the rule of law and determined to fortify national security by gathering the evidence of her mishandling state secrets.


Let's be as blunt about this as the FBI will be: Causing state secrets to reside in a nonsecure, nongovernmental venue, whether done intentionally or negligently, constitutes the crime of espionage.


And there is more. When asked about the consequences of Clinton's brazen exposure of state secrets to anyone who knows how to hack into a nonsecure computer, an intelligence operative winced as if in pain when he remarked that the nation's then chief diplomat surely compromised the ""sources, methods, and lives"" of her colleagues.


Even Democrats who see Clinton as a symbol of their long-time wish for a progressive female in the Oval Office are beginning to recognize that anyone who has jeopardized American lives for political gain is unworthy of their votes, unworthy of their trust and unworthy of public office.

A Houston jury deliberated just two hours before convicting Neal Bland of capital murder in a 2012 shooting over Air Jordan sneakers.

Bland's defense attorney Friday had argued that the 21-year-old is guilty of fatally shooting a Houston man over sneakers, but it was not a capital crime.

""This was not a capital murder, this was a felony murder,"" Kurt Wentz told jurors in closing arguments of Bland's trial. Bland is accused, with three other men, of gunning down Joshua Woods in an attempt to steal several pairs of Air Jordans, the iconic basketball shoes worth $185 a pair.


Mom launches campaign to change Nike's marketing practices
NewsFix

THE CRIME: Man dies after shooting over Air Jordans

Prosecutors said Bland was the triggerman in a four-person crew that went from mall to mall to look for people who had just purchased the collectible shoes released in limited stock on December 21, 2012.

Wentz had argued a nuanced point of law, that his client and his three friends engaged in the felony of robbery, then committed an act clearly dangerous to human life. He said they did not have the intent required to be guilty of capital murder.

If Bland had been found guilty of felony murder, he would have faced a maximum sentence of life in prison, and would have been eligible for parole. After being convicted Friday, he was automatically be sentenced to life without parole.

BACKGROUND: Trial begins in alleged shooting over Air Jordans

During her closing arguments, prosecutor Angela Weltin held up the coveted shoes and called the shooting, ""the classic capital murder.""

""Anything less is an injustice,"" she said.

The victim's mother, Dazie Williams, launched a crusade after the shooting to convince Nike and Michael Jordan to stop the live-release of limited editions of the shoes. She wants the company to either sell them online only or make enough that there will not be violence to get them.

Just before jurors were sent to deliberate Bland's fate Friday morning, the prosecutor reminded them that Woods was a young father who worked two jobs to support his family.

""Joshua Woods will never wear these shoes,"" Weltin said. ""He'll never put on these shoes and teach his son to play basketball.""

The trial, in visiting Judge Leslie Yate's court, began Monday.

Not Sure What I Want ?

I have posted on CL before . . .

I am just not sure what I want, are you ?

I have posted for just romance and nothing else and got some responses, but nothing worked out.

I have been tempted to answer, in fact I have, some of the posts for FWB and Let's DO IT not sure what to expect ?

That was an even bigger failure than the Romance Post plan.

Let me say that I AM married, that will never change for reasons I will not get into right away. Life can be complicated and sometimes you have to fulfill your obligations even if it means enormous compromise.

But at the same time, if I cannot live life and be me . . . then I am cheating myself and everyone around me. I know this sounds very selfish and self centered. Sorry I have to still live and breathe and see the world around me.

There is alot I desire, there is alot I miss, there is so much I want to experience again, and yet I know I must just be patient and take things very, very slow.

I have had a few things happen in my life that brought me to this place and if I found someone who truly wanted to know I would share some of this.

So where do we draw the line ? What is OK and what is not ?

I am also not vanilla ice cream by any stretch of the imagination, not that this may come into play with whatever may come from this,

What that means, and it is a very wide ranging topic, is that I crave passion and kissing and more, but NOT the typical Craigslist Quick Hook Up, in fact I am not sure fucking will be a part of this, although there are so many things I do crave and wish to explore with another who, like me, knows there is more and either is aware or not sure that more is or means.. I will just have to hope that YOU, if there is a YOU out there get this . . . even if only conceptually.

The only way you are still reading this is if you are feeling some commonality or curiosity. This will not be tame, but it is not about anything to be afraid of either, in fact what we crave is excitement beyond the simple that most are satisfied with.

I am not a simple person, even though what I think that I want is quite simple. If you are easily embarrassed or offended this may not be for you, since I want to push things to the very edge, but only out here in the safety of cyber-space at first. So there is very little to fear or worry about.

I know I have not been very clear in what I am looking for or what I want, thus the title, remember the subject line of this post ?

I am hoping you partially get it and have been wondering the same thing about yourself, or are after reading this.

So if you feel the same reply NOW, please put "" I am not sure either "" in your subject line so I know it is a sincere reply

Then you better buckle up, cause it may be a very wild ride, if we do it right ?

OH yes I really would like to know who I am talking to, I hate to do this it is so shallow, but I really have a thing about eyes and I need all the rest too, I read people and your detailed description of you will help me hear you and feel you.

A couple of things, you should be over 18, but beyond that your age is meaningless to me. I prefer a woman who is shaped like a woman, this does not mean you have to be a Barbie Doll, but you have to be somewhat smaller in the middle that the top and bottom and I apologize if this is not you, but it is what works for me. Just to be clear BBW won't work for me, sorry to be blunt. You need to live in the DFW area, if you are outside the area, this is an exercise in futility, unless you travel here OFTEN or something like that.

So are you the ONE that read this whole post and ""get's it"" if so . . . . ANSWER ME NOW . . . . RIGHT NOW . . . . IMMEDIATELY . . . . Please !

Tell me ""I am not sure either"" write to me, talk to me, email me, Hurry, I am waiting for YOU !

I'm a college educated, degreed professional with a vigor for life and a great attitude, in general. I'm an easy going, down to earth, fun to be around and love to laugh and make others around me laugh. I love conversing about things cerebral, and even more so about things silly and goofy. 

I'm not unhappy in my marriage, but at times I feel suffocated by the lack of passion and a little disappointed by the lost connection. I miss a friendship and understanding that's lost in the monotonous routine where one day is like the previous, and tomorrow is all but certain to be a repeat of today.
I don't want to change either of our status or situation, but I want to add levity, laughter, and great conversations. I yearn to reach out to and connect with a woman who is in a similar circumstance and understands what I am talking about. Let's be silly and frivolous with the occasional flirtatious outbursts and banter. Let's support each other as we trudge through an otherwise gloomy day by making it sunny with our inside jokes!

OK, first off, I know this is a platonic section and I am not looking for sex. What I am looking for is a female, preferably married, that wants to frequently email, IM, text, and possibly hangout for coffee/drinks, as our schedules allow. I also am looking for a woman that thinks being open and flirty can make a friendship better. I am not looking to hook up, but it would be fun to have a woman that I love spending time with and acknowledges that men and women always have a tension between them. I am seeking a woman who is classy, smart, educated, and wants to be herself and playful when we are together. The main point is to find someone to spend free time with, but not putting limits on it.

So I come to Dallas 1-3 times a month, and would love to find someone who...enjoys good conversation...is open-minded...loves trying new restaurants...enjoy live music and movies...loves exploring unique aspects to the city...and perhaps who just loves to explore in general.

Myself, I am good looking and in very good shape (5'10"" & 200#s). I think most would call me a mix of funny, intelligent, charming and engaging. I have a good career and overall a great life, and I just love meeting new people, having adventures, and hate sitting in a hotel room by myself at night.

I would prefer this someone to be attractive and in shape as well. I hope to find someone who loves adventures...or maybe wishes they had more in their life. I don't care if you are married or dating someone or single, I do not pass any judgment.

If you are interested, then please just shoot me a note with a little info about yourself and we will simply go from there.

A little about me: I am very versatile. I like to drink, break out the glow sticks and go dancing, or hit up the bar occasionally; but I also like to go wine tasting, hiking, go to a concert or an art gallery, stay in and watch anime or comedies, hang out with Mary J and play Mario Kart, or just go out and be goofy somewhere.

I'm not looking for a hookup, fwb, booty call... no exchange of cash, no drugs (not even 420), nothing illegal or too kinky or depraved. I'm just looking for companionship with a good woman. At the end of the date, maybe a nice kiss, or whatever we want based on our mutual attraction.

I'm looking for a lady reasonably close to my demographic in terms of age/race/status/interests, but I'm open to others as well.

My name is Michael Vackers, swm. Dob October 1st 1991. Blonde hair down to my chest.
Total nerd.
CL won't let me upload a pic, so if you send a picture, you'll get one of me in return.
I'm going on a trip with my family out to California in five weeks (Spring break in March). What we do is Visit my Great-Grandma and other family out there in the desert. We make bon fires, grill some good food, ride atv's and generally just have a great time. So I hear, this will be my first time to go, I'd really like to find a lady friend before we head out so I'm not alone most of the time.
This trip is for a week, so you won't have to sleep beside me or anything, we can make accommodations and I'm a respectful person.
As the plan stands now, I'll be riding with my family in the truck (there's room for one more ) because I don't want to drive my 1998 Camry all the way out there . It'd be nice to find someone with a vehicle, we could take turns following my Dad out there. And I could pitch in for gas if that were the case.
SO if you can afford to take a weeks vacation during March (I can give the specific dates if interested!) do not hesitate to contact me.
Very chill environment without expectations, 
you'll be accepted by my family.

Hows it goin out there? Craigslist is the only way I can make this happen so here it goes. 

Good head on his shoulders, SANE, down to earth guy here looking for similar gay/bisexual Christian discrete guys to hang out with. They would have to accept themselves for being gay or having gay desires and be okay with it through reconciling it with God and studying the context of the bible or at least have a desire to do so. Not looking for a hook up. I'm looking for special niche of guy out there... group of Christian gay or gay-accepting guys with similar southern values (20s to mid 30s max) seeking to strengthen their faith as christians. I am a conservative gay man that is not an in your face here and queer type of guy. This group ideally would be a tight Christian group of guys that seeks to function like a pack of brothers in a non sexual way although if one of us ends up dating up we would have to acknowledge that and not let it break up the group. It happens in the straight world all the time. .... I know that sounds like mixing oil and water but the goal of this group is to form a brotherhood of young gay Christian guys that bond well together and support each other throughout life, meet up on Friday nights at each other's house for dinner, talk about how God is working in our lives through bible study, go on camping retreats together, work out together, hiking, enjoying life... I am an attractive masculine young man but I am not needing a partner right now... just a group of other masculine, Christian guys I mesh well with which typically is the easy going, straight acting, sane and positive attitude type of guy, good family values and upbringing, non confrontational, and just all around cool...

If you are interested in doing something like this or even if you are bi curious, Christian, and in the closet and this ad jives well with you hit he up. This would be a discreet group so privacy would be upheld here. 

Again, this group is to help build a group of gay brothers/gay accepting brothers that mesh well together and study the bible in a real and practical way that supports our lives as gay christians. Heck if your straight, and meet the description of this ad otherwise than respond. 

I am asking you to send an updated face pic and description of yourself including your age. Asking for a pic for the simple fact that a pic says a thousand words and help to determine if you would go well with the group. Again, discretion is upheld so no worries. Group would meet in mid cities or Dallas.

I am looking for somewhat of an ongoing thing; if you just want to talk just for a day or so, please let me know in advance. 

(I am posting in the Strictly Platonic section because there will be no meetings and no actual sex)

Would you like an online chat buddy?

I am looking for someone to chat with through email. We could talk about anything interesting, but I would like there to be some flirting, innuendo, and even some back-and-forth dirty chatting, if you're interested, but no pressure. There will be no pressure for actual sex, only online encounters. This will give us both the freedom to share whatever we want, without fear of embarassment.

You can share pictures without face, if you feel comfortable, but not required. Total anonymity is the goal.

I would like you to have a sense of humor, be articulate, and not be self-absorbed or rude. I would want us to both be free to share stories, fantasies, or whatever without judgement from the other person. I do have limits on what I will not talk about.

I am only looking for sane, stable, non-married people.

I prefer 21-40 year old physically fit people, but that is not an absolute requirement.

If you would like to have this type of online encounter, maybe allow your inner sexual personality to come out a bit, then email me. Change the subject line to your favorite color to eliminate spam. When responding, please tell me a little about yourself; short responses like ""hey"" will probably not get a reply.

I'm not exactly sure why I'm posting this, but here goes. If you're a married mother of younger kids, sometimes wanting to have a close friend to talk to, and not looking for anything physical but essentially an online connection, our situations might be similar. Do you feel like you have things to say, but sometimes keep them to yourself; not because they're highly personal but maybe your spouse just doesn't hear you? You do have friends, but you still feel there's a certain kind of connection that's missing, something you'd like to explore? If all of that's hard to put your finger on, it sounds like me.

I'm married, in my 40's, have younger children, educated, well traveled, creative, and generally have a happy life. But I sometimes miss having as many friends as I used to before marriage. It would be nice to connect with someone who is in a similar situation, would like to have an open dialogue about things, maybe personal, maybe topical. Are you intelligent, articulate? If so, I would like to start this friendship by emailing and see if we click. Again, I cannot over stress the ""platonic"" nature of this friendship, as there is no way I'm looking to change my situation or anyone else's.

http://dallas.craigslist.org/ftw/stp/5403278304.html,Married but looking for an actual connection - m4w,"
Hello,

I've been married for ages. So long that it seems like forever. I guess I'm going through my midlife crisis and I'm contemplating where I am and if I'm content. I've been so unhappy for so long that I've just accepted it however, I realized that it isn't fair. Why shouldn't I be happy in addition to just living? One of the parts of my life that is in bad shape is the need for a strong female connection. Obviously, with careers, mortgages, kids its hard to just say, ""Screw it. I'm moving out."" But there has to be more to life than having sex once a year and being ignored while I'm in the same room, right?

I'm looking for someone educated, who can hold a conversation. Maybe someone who is subversive but fun. I wouldn't lie and say looks aren't important but there is beauty in everyone. It would be cool if our relationship turned sexual. I'm not saying I would or wouldn't do anything but its a possibility.

I'm white but race doesn't matter too much. Just no Martians, please. I had a bad experience with them growing up and I just can't tolerate them. 

In any case, have fun and enjoy the upcoming weekend.

And no... I won't be your sugar-daddy. Give me a break.

Good Afternoon, 

I recently saw a post from a new and confused submissive looking for guidance. And as an experienced Dom it got me thinking that possibly their are others in the same situation. 

So I want to offer myself in that role. If you are thinking of entering the lifestyle, or are curious, have questions, or are in need of a mentor. Please feel free to contact me. I know at times we would love to go to our friends or spouse but I also know that is not always a viable option for whatever reason. There will be no judgement and I of course will be VERY discrete if needed.

I just know that woman want to explore this side of themselves but dont know where to begin. Send me an email and we can talk.

I'm on a quest for a married woman who is seeking a friend, most likely a platonic one, outside of her marriage. I would prefer us to keep this online for the most part, but I'm open to meeting for coffee/lunch if the connection is there and we develop that level of trust. I particularly admire intelligent women who are scientific thinkers. If you read your horoscope frequently, believe in ghosts, or attend church, then we probably won't have much in common. However, if you are a geeky professional, an engineer or scientist, then we will probably get along. Do you remember Ellie Arroway from the movie Contact? If you have something in common with her, then please say hello. :) I'm quite down to earth, reasonably handsome and fit. You should be reasonably fit and attractive too, but I don't expect perfection. Each woman is unique, and I'm not too shallow. When you write back, please tell me a little about yourself, and why my ad caught your attention. Mention something that lets me know that you read my ad. Otherwise I'll think your e-mail is spam. I hope to hear from you.

Are you crawling through postings out of boredom, curiosity, excitement, enticement or any other words that have suffixes of -dom, -ity, -ment or others? I guess you must be wondering ""wouldn't it be great to have an electronic friend to exchange musings, rants, longing and/or advice""? If so, maybe we both are in a similar boat, and could possibly develop a special intimacy through our inboxes. You can be married, single, attached, but if you are married and have kids, we might be able to relate better. Definite bonus points for sense of humor, ironic insight and wanting to feel a rush from meeting someone new. Want to know more about me? Reply with a little bit about yourself, and your situation and what you are seeking. Won't hurt a bit, but it may make you wiggle and giggle a little.

I've always had one good female friend when I was younger. I really miss it. It'd be nice to have someone again to share good time and advice and etc. 

A little about me:

Kind of a hermit despite being a social person. Don't get me wrong, I can have as much fun at a party or a show as I can sitting at home in front of the computer. Also I like drugs and drinking. Not REAL drugs though. 

What I'm looking for:

You can't be easily offended. I laugh at everything. I'd prefer if you were single, mostly just to avoid that whole drama. Plus, it's easier to build a friendship with someone if they aren't clinging to their significant other the whole time as most couples tend to do.

OK, it's probably not realistic, but I figured I might as well shoot for the moon here in detailing my criteria for a great email/IM partner. In a perfect universe, she would be:

-- Age 30-50

-- Too much of a grammar/literacy nerd to engage in a lot of abbreviating
-- Somewhat brainy (interested in books, current events, art, etc.)
-- At least tolerant of sports (playing and watching)
-- Flirty, but in a mature, compelling way
-- Level-headed and non-stalkery
-- Interested in periodic emailing throughout the day

If you're even in the ballpark (6 out of 8, let's say), I'd love to hear from you.

It's one thing to want something casual, to think one night stands are all you need. It's another thing to know you want a profound bond, to find someone that you just get and who gets you. That's what I want. I want a love like you read in a storybook, perfectly imperfect and made for each other.

I'm from california, and looking to relocate if I find the right motivation. 

Pleased to meet you. A little more about me, I'm twenty four pretty nice looking I suppose, though i don't base much on that. Curvy and thick in stature, half Japanese half white. I'm a comic book nerd, and supernatural fanatic. I write and read, crochet and paint. I'll try anything once

Do you ever wish that you had a special friend that you could talk to about anything in the world? Do you want to laugh over the smallest of things and just have someone that makes you smile when you think about them? I am looking for a woman between 35-45 preferably Caucasian and a BBW. That is the kind of woman that I love. The soft curves of her body make me weak. I am late 30's Caucasian with dark hair and blue eyes. I am hoping to find a woman that loves to talk and loves to be herself with those she is around. I am married but he will not be involved unless you don't mind him watching if we are both comfortable. He may hang out with us from time to time but that's it unless we (you and I) decide to do something different. He knows of my bisexuality and is supportive of it. If interested we should be able to meet in a public place at first and see if we hit it off. I am looking for a good friend and if something sexual happens that's even better but not mandatory. I hope that you are open to the sexual part because let's face it that is what i want in addition to a good friend. I want to be comfortable with someone before we move to that level. Hopefully this will be a long-term friendship but I have no expectations other than honesty. If you aren't interested just be honest about it. I don't have time for any games..

Hi! 

How are you today? I am a 22 yr old white female looking to find a special someone. Maybe start off as FWB that leads to more. I am in a relationship with a man but he will NOT be involved.

I am a little nerdy. My favorite show is Doctor Who but I also love watching crime documentaries. I watch other stuff as well but I get in moods where I pick a certain topic and watch almost anything I can find on it. I love learning. I love to cook but hate cleaning. I am an animal lover and have 6 fur babies. I can be a bit of a girly girl in some aspects but am pretty relaxed in others. I just joined a gym and am trying to be healthier. I am a size 16/18 depending on the brand. I am about 5' tall. I am quite curvy. 

I am looking to find someone I can enjoy hanging out with. Someone who maybe enjoys some of the same things I do and someone who can broaden my horizons. I can be quite shy at first unless I instantly click with you. I want someone who sex isn't all they want. Someone who likes cuddling while watching a movie. I'm hoping to find someone near my age 21+ as I do like to have a drink or two in the evenings. Someone who hopefully lives in or near Plano. Your pic gets mine. I won't respond to replies without a picture. NO NUDES please. No men. 

I hope to hear from you and I hope you have a wonderful day!!

http://dallas.craigslist.org/dal/w4w/5395887787.html,Searching for the one,"
I am not sure if I am looking for the love of my life here or not and I am admittedly a little skeptical of these types of sites myself. I just know that regardless of what anyone is looking for, you have to be friends first and get to know one another so there is no unrealistic expectations placed on the relationship. I'm not at all into head games and I have learned that upfront honesty is the key to anything, but especially in establishing friendships and love that will endure the test of time.

What am I looking for?

YOU know who you are and what you want. You set goals and achieve what you want. You are fit, active, and intelligent. You enjoy a rewarding & challenging career.You embrace the dark as well as the light. You feel and express emotion freely and with sensitivity. You refuse to carry another's emotional baggage, and yet are empathetic. You speak honestly and act with integrity. You compromise only what you do, not who you are. You love yourself and want to share your wants and needs with a partner.

About me,
I am 39, career blessed and happy with my life. Just missing someone to share it with. I am an incurable romantic who treasures, cherishes and appreciates sincerity, integrity, honesty and warmth. I enjoy picnics, laughing, talking, touching, affection and physical closeness. A good listener who enjoys mutual spoiling and also I am a one-woman, woman.

If your looking for the same please send a picture with reply
Please no men

I hope you're familiar with AlFred Kinsey and the Kinsey scale of sexuality. I would say that by far, I am more attracted to men, but there are a few women that I can't keep my eyes off of. 

I think we call that ""sexual fluidity."" 

I'm looking for a woman to help me explore the aforementioned fluidity. I am 26 years old, college educated, great job, currently in Graduate school pursuing my Master's degree in Counseling Psychology. I have a big heart, full of laughs, great big extrovert, and can converse in both casual and intellectual conversation. 

I'm looking for a very feminine lady that is somewhat older. The ideal ages would be anywhere from 30 - 45 and in my head she would be Caucasian. (I have a complex about dating myself, my mom, or my sisters lol) 

I would consider myself an attractive, feminine, yet tomboyish female. I wear dresses, heels, and makeup, but I'll also wear basketball shorts and tennis shoes. I fall into the BBW category and don't mind what size you are as long as it looks good on you. 

I don't really have an agenda as to what I would like to happen between us. But, at the very least, happy hour and drinks are in order!

Side note: I have no desire in hooking up with you and your husband or boyfriend. Not my thing...

Eventually im looking for a long term relationship. I'm looking for someone to share smiles and laughs and create new memories with or someone I can go out on dates and see where it takes us. Im pretty laid back, open minded with a great sense of humor. Im very shy at first but very sweet. I have much confidence. I'm a stud more masculine than femme. I like to look my best for her and myself. I'm out going and modest. I'm looking for a person to be friends with first but a person that will take a relationship with her girlfriend seriously actually makes time to spend with each other. I want her to be the most important part of my life and vice versa I enjoy doing thoughtful and romantic things for that special someone in my life.... like my girlfriend making her feel like she's absolutely significant and essential in my life. I am funny and a kid at heart. Life is too short and it is meant to be shared with someone that you feel whole heartily about.....I am a cancer if that makes a difference. I enjoy going out for dinner and a movie or just talk/text on the phone to "" how your day was"" and everything under the sun. If you enjoy short road trips, movies, fun moments and being affectionate let's meet. I want a woman who prefers to be ""that girl"" who enjoys getting her hair did and nails done, high maintenance - no problem and takes good care of herself and making sure she smells good but doesn't get all weird about a lazy day in sweats if this is you .... look no further, Im here... pick me. My second language is Spanish. I guess u can call me old fashion. I will be the one opening your car door. Also I'll be the one walking side by side never walking in front only when the statement of ""ladies first"" is spoken thats when ill be walking in back of you. My best side would be for me to step back and point at you. My heart holds truth, loyalty, love and respect. Feel free to ask me anything I will be honest and not tell you what u want to hear. Im an open book. This is real and I'm real. Send your reply with a pic. No pic no reply. Sorry that's just how it goes. Pls no nude pics I want to know your name and get to know you first

As the title implies, I'm not in TX. I reside in Connecticut but I'm not into the females out here so why not try something new? I don't mind texting, FT, snapchat, whatever. Let's build a connection and see where it takes us.

First thing's first, I'm polyamorous. I believe in open, honest relationships and I love seeing my partners love freely. This does not mean that I'm looking to be a third in your relationship, or that I'm looking to add someone to mine. This means that I'm aware that people are not property and should be allowed to love as they please. I understand that this lifestyle isn't for everyone, so keep that in mind before replying. I'm in my mid 20's, tattooed, pierced and gauged. Chubby so if you're not into that, feel free to stop reading now. Gender fluid but more on the stud side. About 5'2, black hair & dark brown eyes. I'm funny, sarcastic, humble and easy to talk to. I have the attention span of a two year old and I'm a kid at heart. Museums and art galleries are my happy place. Take me to the zoo or the aquarium and you've pretty much lost me, I can be there for hours. I'm a hopeless romantic with a dirty mind, just about anything can be turned into an inappropriate joke.

I'm looking for someone smart, funny and honest with a good head on their shoulders. I prefer chubby girls but I'm not too focused on looks. If you'd like to get to know someone new feel free to send a message. Your pic gets mine.

No fems, bi women or men, you'd be wasting your time.

Hi. I am a African-American stud seeking a best-friend and something long-term with her. Well, it is safe to say that marriage is the goal. Now, do not get scared off by the term ""marriage,"" so hear me out. As a mature adult in her late twenties, I know what I want, and it is time out with the games, playing around, and etc. I am not looking for someone that wants to text all the time and never link up, or someone that talks for a day, a week or two and call it quits, or someone that is not serious about eventually becoming a couple somewhere down the road. I want someone that is consistent and persistent, just simply will not give up on me, herself or a possibility of it being an us. By any means, I am in no way perfect, not even close to it, but I am in a place in my life where I just want one woman, no ifs ands or buts about it. It is absolutely tiring ""talking"" to people and after a week or two things are over as if nothing has happened, and it is tiring simply just ""dating"" person after person thinking that a strong foundation is something that they want also. 

Hi. I am an African-American stud seeking a best-friend and something long-term with her. Well, it is safe to say that marriage is the goal. Now, do not get scared off by the term ""marriage,"" so hear me out. I apologize if this maybe a bit long. As a mature adult in her late twenties, I know what I want, and it is time out with the games, playing around, and etc. I am not looking for someone that wants to text all the time and never link up, or someone that talks for a day, a week or two and call it quits, or someone that is not serious about eventually becoming a couple somewhere down the road. I want someone that is consistent and persistent, just simply will not give up on me, herself or a possibility of it being an us. By any means, I am in no way perfect, not even close to it, but I am in a place in my life where I just want one woman, no ifs ands or buts about it. It is absolutely tiring ""talking"" to people and after a week or two things are over as if nothing has happened, and it is tiring simply just ""dating"" person after person thinking that a strong foundation is something that they want also.

I just want to be given a chance, a chance at someone's heart. I want someone to give me their time for their love in advance. I am more than willing to show a woman that I am for her, just as she is for me. I am all about action with very little talking. I walk the walk and talk the talk. I come with it. I bring more to the table than just a plate, utensils and the air that I breathe. I am ambitious. I work hard. I am a true go-getter. I am strong, passionate, caring, loving, honest, confident, and loyal. I truly do love to laugh and joke around. I am laid-back and very down to earth. With me, I come drama-free and disease-free. I am a neat freak. I love peace and quietness. I am very independent. I have my own place and vehicle. I work full-time, and I attend college Although, I bring a lot to the table, I am also a very flawed individual. I am stubborn, hard-headed at times, sarcastic, blunt, and nonchalant. I am not into clubs or bars. I may go to a club or bar once every two years or so, maybe even longer than that, but it is just not my thing. I do not smoke. I do not do drugs. I drink occasionally. I am low-key, and mainly solo, that is if I am not with my friends and their families.

I am single, and have been for quite some time now. I chose to remain single and focus on self, just so I can prepare myself and make sure I am right for the next woman. Now I am ready 100%. While being single, I chose to work harder and refocus my vision. So, basically, I placed work as my number one priority.

I am looking for a feminine woman (femm), preferably a girly girl. Someone that does not smoke or do drugs, and that is disease free. I want someone that is SINGLE, and drama free. I do not want a woman that has a man or girlfriend. I want someone that is absolutely SERIOUS with dating exclusively, and wanting to be mine. I simply want a grown, mature woman. If we choose to date upon exchanging information and after our first date, then I want it to be just about you and I with no outsiders. If we are both not what we are looking for in one another, then there is no need in wasting your time or mine, especially after a day or two, maybe a week or two. Lets just cut to the chase. I do not care what your race maybe. Be older than 21. Have your own, and be able to travel and ready to meet up. Please, attach a photograph when replying, or I am simply just going to delete it, just being honest. Be ready, willing, and able to voice verify. Well, I cannot wait to meet my best-friend and my potential lady love.

No body here is perfect, especially not me. I'm married, but I have been wanting to experience another woman for some time now. This is not an ad to be with my husband, strictly for me. I'm athletic but feminine, short and spunky. I think I'm attractive but I'll let you be the judge of that. I'd love to find a friend. Someone to hang out with outside of the bedroom. I'm not a big drinker but I enjoy going out. I've recently gotten into country dancing, so maybe we can do that. Not really sure what to put here as I've never posted before. If you have any questions feel free to message me and I'd be happy to answer. 

Hope to hear from you soon

Please read my entire ad to be sure that you are the right woman for me. I'm open to a female playmate of any race, but you must be 18 years old or older of course. Body type is not of any real concern, but I am partial to BBW...that's a plus! I'm NOT looking to be with another woman in person, just some Skype fun. I'm a very caring and respectful woman, but sexually, I like to be in control, tell my partner what to do and lead the conversation. You must enjoy doing as you are told and speaking as you are led to speak, or you won't garner any pleasure from our time together. I'd love to hear from you if you think that you are right for me.

I've posted before but haven't in months so I thought I'd try again.

I'm a regular person, totally real and not a robot, and I am single again. I'm looking for someone to hang out with and start a relationship with if we click. No FWB, if you're not open to being serious with someone, I'm not the girl for you.

I have a great job, a car, my own place, no kids, I was married once but have been divorced for years. I have a master's degree and a super playful dog that already loves you. I built my own gaming pc a few months ago so hopefully you like video games. I cook a lot, love to bake and am more likely to chill at home than go out, but that's mostly because all my friends are married and have kids so I'm home alone all the damn time.

I have super sore shoulders constantly so if you can give massages, we'll be best friends (I'll always give one back).

I need a man with the ability to suck it up and keep living life with your chin up even when things get shitty. 
What I dont need is a pansy ass mommas boy whos idea of fun is staring at xbox or facebook. I need someone I can drag off into the woods for the weekend and we're both comfortable with it being just the two of us. I need someone capable of communicating authentically. Is there anyone out there?

Did you wake up today wondering what'd you do? What about for a sec did you think about how it would be nicer to have some company by your side. 

I have a great life, yet often I find myself wondering how it could be better with the right partner. 

It's like I know it hasnt worked with others because you're still out there waiting on me as I on you.

Maybe we don't have all the same things in common, but you enjoy accompanying me to an art show and I to Game Stop, idk. But we enjoy each others company, even if it's just a walk through downtown. We can talk about our lives apart from each other and our plans. 

I love that you're assertive and open minded, yet kind and sweet with a good heart. 

I know you're out there. 

You enjoy holding hands, having our gazes meet from across a room and make my heart melt with your goofy smile. You pay attention to the details. You like it when I play with your hair and wrap my arm around your waist to hold onto the loop of your jeans. What about the graze of my nails on the side of your arm. 

I know you're out there.

Hello,

I am a fun, outgoing, kind, giving, caring, inquisitive, reliable woman (BBW) looking for a good man. Yes, I know what you're thinking. She just posted all of those descriptions to make her seem like my dream girl. Well, to that I would say I am also someone who can be very skeptical. More of an 'alright, you talk the talk and lets see if you can walk the walk now' and if we got to the point of meeting I would be able to prove myself of every word. That is one of the most important factors for me is to actually be authentic.

Now onto what I am looking for.

I am giving and caring person. But at times I find myself drained of helping all the time with no one to reciprocate. I crave the little things like cuddling and just being with 'him', if I were to be really honest the shoulder and foot rubs too.

My ideal man would be communicative, affectionate, ideally between the ages of 25-37, assertive and protective, giving, have his own transportation, and stable job. If you have read this message all the way through and still like the idea of getting to know me please email me with the subject like: I will take care of you. Just to help filter out.

So, my ex gave me HSV2 when he cheated on me after he got me pregnant. When I confronted him, he backed out of everything and now im scared. I want a family, to be married, someone who would be a father to my baby and love it the same as their own. Someone who could love a damaged soul like mine. 

If you want a family and dont care about my hsv2, email me. Id love to meet you. I am a slim, red head with green eyes. Im 21 and ready to settle down. 


Thanks �

A woman who carries herself in a sophisticated manner is considered extremely sexy. Perhaps dangerous. From her glowing, radiant appearance to her personality, you're wondering if you want to take a chance. You should never be afraid of an opportunity. Don't pass her by. After all, she could be the one you have been looking for all of this time.

Wouldn't be nice to have a woman by your side who is charming, gorgeous, and respectful? A lady who is beautiful inside a out? A woman who appreciates you for everything that you do for her?
Take a chance. Let's indulge life with a bottle of our choice and experience our dreams and goals, together.

I got my heart broken by someone I actually care about, I felt they cared about me too, but distance was an issue. 
I am single and have been for a while, most people say it's my body... Beautiful face, voice, hair, blue eyes and clear white skin, but a bit chunky and tall, 5 foot 10. I'm intelligent and I am very hard working. 
I am looking for someone who is willing to take it slow with me, maybe just chat on the phone, text and facebook for a while... To build an emotional connection. 

If you're interested...Send a pic and contact information and I will get back to you and send a pic back...

Finding Love is like finding a New Job. There is an interview process and that determines whether or not if you want to move forward with them. Its hard sometimes to find that one person who will love you for who you are. Sometimes it feels like were playing Powerball and just praying that we get the numbers correct. Sometimes waiting around for Mr. Right to show up does not happen and years go by. So taking a chance and praying that I can meet a nice man is wishful. 
For me I am a single mom to two kids. My kids mean the world to me. They do come first in my life. I am looking for a man that can I understand that. Family time is important. I also work full-time and enjoy my job. Im also a photographer on the side. I am ""Awake"" .In my free time I like going to the movies, karaoke, and going to the park. I also like to take road trips. 
I am looking for a man who is understanding and caring. Traditional and a Hopeless Romantic. I am looking for a man who wants a relationship with possible marriage. Laughter, Good Communicator and Listener.

Hello! First things first, I'm poly. If you don't know what that is or that notion offends you...this ad isn't for you. Also just to state up front, I'm not seeking a couple or to join a triad. 

I'm a 35 year old female searching for a guy who is looking for a casual dating relationship that has the ability to turn into something more on down the road. I do currently have a secondary partner that I'm very pleased with, but I'm searching for someone that, at some point, can fill a primary role in my life. 

So this is me. I'm looking for a guy in close proximity to the HEB area and under the age of 50 with little to no drama that has space in his life to hang out with a great casual woman.

I'm a kinky gal, searching for a kinky guy with an open mind. I am a feminine, hedonistic geek with a propensity for assertive and intelligent companions. And when I say geek, I mean I am nice broad spectrum type of geek. I watch the History Channel almost as often as I watch FOX (as in Bones not O'Reilly). I love the outdoors. I camp frequently and sometimes in less than ideal situations (and I enjoy it). I like Buffy and Firefly. In my spare time, I play video games. New gadgets make me weak in the knees. I enjoy traveling and do so frequently both with work and on my own. I read a great deal (and more than what some would consider to be healthy) with varied interests. I love small ""hole in the wall"" restaurants, ethnic foods, and interactive dining. I find geeks incredibly sexy no matter what flavor of geek they might be. Mainly because to be a geek means you are passionate about something, and passion is never a bad thing.

I am a curvy 5'4"" and 190 pounds. I am incredibly happy with my body, and you should be as well. I am a brunette with curly hair.

Hopefully all of this gives you a good understanding of just what it is I am looking for, and hopefully it is appealing to you as well. I strive to be open and honest so I welcome any questions anyone may have. Please respond with a photo and I will do the same. Thanks for reading.

It's incredibly insane that I am using Craigslist to find new people. But considering I really don't ""go out"" very much, it's almost the perfect place in a really, really weird way.

So, what am I looking for? I'm ""hoping"" to find someone who can A) carry a conversation. I'm a talker. I love having a phone conversation & even more so having an actual conversation with someone who doesn't look at their phone constantly. B) have a friendship with. An honest to goodness friendship. I have friends, sure. But I am the ONLY person in my entire group of friends who is either single and/or doesn't have kids. Yeah, you read that right. I am almost thirty with no kids. So unusual, I know. C) spend time with. Yeah, this may be a tough one, but knowing there could be a possibility is a bit exciting.

I am incredibly independent. I like to travel. Random day road trips are my absolute favorite! I'm a book nerd, who is a sucker for a happily ever after. I'm sarcastic as heck. & I personally think I'm hilarious, but everyone has their own opinion.

If you think you:

1) Can keep a conversation going to the point that you intrigue me
2) have amazing friendship qualities
3) Are just wanting to see what the hell happens
4) Are NOT going to kill me

... then you should definitely reply. 

I'm pretty sure I've rambled this entire ad thus far, so I'm now going to stop & go enjoy this beautiful Saturday!

Hi, 

I am a really sweet and caring girl just looking for my new best friend. I am envious of those couples that seem to really enjoy being with each other and hoping one day to find the same. I am a hopeless romantic - I listen to all the most romantic songs and imagine my prince charming coming to dance with me to them. 

Corny I know, but a girl can dream. I am have various interests, some of which actually coincide with mainstream ""masculine"" hobbies -- ie video gaming, watching the cowboys (they were rough without romo this year), hiking, etc. I love to try new things as well, and enjoy finding new people to do things with. 

I hate meeting people with expectations, just some great friends that possibly develops into more would be great. I mean it can take a little while for anyone to open up, and being rushed or forced never really works out anyway. 

I am 27 years old, white, brown eyes and hair, and overweight. Yes, its true. I have two cats that I adore and hope that you love animals as well. 

I am open to chatting and seeing where it goes from there, let me know of some interests and hobbies you enjoy. I hope to meet some nice people! Please be *somewhat* close to my age and drug free. Some ambition in life would be great too, just someone who knows what they want and how to get there.

Hello If you only knew how often you cross my mind, consuming my thoughts. I miss you even though I've never had you. Throughout my life I have been lucky enough to experience love and I have also learnt what it feels like to go without. The dull ache from loneliness courses through my body. The tears have spilt out of my eyes landing on my pillow because sometimes it's too much to take. I know exactly how much I have to give to you. 
Craving so desperately your gentle embrace, just tight enough that I won't slip away but light enough to give me the room I need to breath. Wanting to drink you in and escape into you. 
I often sit alone at my table eating the food I've prepared looking at your empty spot, wishing for your companionship. Those easy going conversations and comfortable silences. Have I had you, only for you to slip away? Are you searching for me right now? 
I've looked for you time and time again always coming up short. Where will we find each other? Online? Will we see each other somewhere and recognize a safe place in one another's eyes? Oh my sweet, dear friend, my lover come to me. Let my words awaken you. I wait for you as patiently as I can possibly bear.

http://dallas.craigslist.org/dal/w4m/5416917932.html,Passion and Chemistry,"
I am looking for a long term relationship with a man who I feel passion, chemistry, a strong physical connection with.
I have only found 1 guy in my life who I felt this way for and I am desperately craving it again. It's hard to find. 
It's not like being with some average person you settle for or someone with just a nice body and gorgeous smile you find hot. 
Its an intense connection emotionally and physically. I do believe in ""love at first sight.""
Here's the catch: I am shy, insecure, inexperienced, a little overweight and dependent. 
I want a man to take care of me, to boost my self esteem and compliment me regularly. 
To tell me and show me he wants me and not stop after a few months into the relationship and expect me to ""just know."" 
I need a man to help show me its ok to be me, ok to open up and let loose and not hide. Someone patient with me being inexperienced, someone non-judgmental,
and someone who can motivate me to be better, to be who I want to be, to be who you want in a girl and to wow you.
A guy to work out with me and be active with to push me out of my comfort zone.
I can be fiesty and needy, and I need a real man who can handle it. 
This all seems like a lot, but I don't think its too much different than most relationship hurdles.
I can be a great lover/partner to the right person.I'd like a man who is strong, with good hygiene, has a stable income, a car, 
27-40yrs old, drug and disease free, taller than 5' 7"" and preferably doesnt smoke cigarettes.
If this describes you and you think you can give me what I need, hit me up and we'll talk more.
Please be honest and up front about what you're looking for and what you need, also be as detailed as possible about yourself. 
I am serious and dont want to waste too much time with pointless email tag. Must include a couple photos of yourself or no reply.
Thanks

http://dallas.craigslist.org/sdf/w4m/5416917936.html,A New Year,"
1st let me say I'm a totally cool chic, college educated, have had some absolute amazing positions in my career that most only dream about. I've learned that a career isn't what makes a person special no matter what others tell you. 
I'm actually more humble and kind than I am arrogant and uncaring of others thoughts and feelings.

So here comes the difficult part and never in a million years did I ever think I'd be in a situation where I would be seeking something a bit unorthodox. 
Bare with me while I gather my thoughts and try to cautiously govern what I'm about to say...............
I'd like to meet an attractive man between the age of 29-37
You must be a Non Smoker
Have a solid job or career
Own your own vehicle
Be completely straight 
Fully believe in God (Christian) not atheist, agnostic or anything else that I might of forgotten to list, oh did I say and not into anything Satanic? Yikes
You Must be healthy and range from fit to average 
If you are Military affiliated that works for me since my background is Military. Military just seems to mesh better with other Military types.

If you like dogs that's cool since I'm thinking about getting one. 
I have a cool pad, my own vehicle and my own income. 
I'm average looking and I'm considered attractive average. I believe confidence and high self esteem go a long way and make a difference. 
I don't drink, do drugs and I'm 100% positive I am disease free so you be too.

I'm a chic that can clock anyone, female or male if need be. However brawls are not what I seek. I was raised with manners and proper etiquette has been instilled within me. 

In short something has come up where I need to have someone else with me for a bit to help make me feel secure, safe and protected while at home.
Oh and I'm going to install locks where there were none and I'm changing the others. Invasion of any kind whether it be home invasion, personal invasion or any other intrusions or acts that make a person not feel safe is pure evil, especially if it may not be a stranger. 
I'm very new to this area and haven't really met anyone yet. 
It would be nice if you know how to shoot and you wouldn't mind teaching me how to shoot. I prefer a rifle 1st before a handgun but that can be discussed. In the past I haven't had very good aim but I'm looking to improve. 

That is all I'm willing to share in reference to the circumstances I'm posting about on CL. 
I'm sitting here telling myself this is ridiculous but at this point what do I really have to lose? I definitely can sense a predator type whether they seem charming or not and my personal space and comfort zone has already been violated. 
My thoughts now are Freck it!!! I seek to have someone with me most nights until I get things sorted out. 
Also do understand I hate drama, I go out of my way to avoid drama and I do expect you to have very little drama. I'm only going to deal with the average normal % of drama that just comes with life. Otherwise stay out of my life. 
Yep, I'm not like most chics, in fact I think I'm a lot cooler than many of them. 
I'm good to those who are good to me. 
Others that I'm good to and I give them no name to place with a kind person who's helped them when in need, well that's between God and I.
So if you think you can hangout with me without too many questions asked and just enjoy one day at a time send me a response that has more than one sentence in it. 
Tell me about yourself and why I can have some initial trust in you and feel safe!?! Include a photo or I WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT RESPOND BACK!
Trust me when I say I'm highly intelligent and I'm fully aware how odd and nuts this post seems. Somethings are better not explained and that's where I stand on the subject at this time. If you are intelligent you'll have a good enough understanding on your own. 
Don't ask me my age just know I'm in my 30's, good to go!
Happy New Year!

My life is very full at the moment, but there is still something missing. I have 2 amazing children, a good job, a house, and my own car. I want for very little, but the lack of a man in my life is becoming an issue. I am a strong, independent woman, and I don't ""need"" a man in my life - I want to make that very clear. I want a man to share my already amazing life with. A man with integrity, who is kind, honest, respectful, considerate, and in control of his life. A man that will treat me like a queen, but understands I am not a damsel in distress. I want to find a man that will love me unconditionally and allow me to do the same. I want to settle down and create a new life with the man of my dreams. Craigslist may not be the perfect place for that, but until they create a Build-A-Man store, this is where I'm at. 

What I need from you is very simple, you MUST be single-I can't stress this enough!- I will not date a married man, so don't even try. You should have a steady job, transportation, and be ready to settle down with the right woman. I am looking for a serious relationship, not a fling. I don't mind if you have children, but I don't want any more of my own. I will be more than happy to blend our two families into a loving home. 

I live west of Benbrook. If this sounds appealing to you, please send me an email, and let's see if we hit it off.

Hey guys. I am ready to give my all to one special man. I know the bible says that a man finds his wife, so I'm hoping that if I put myself out there that he will find me. I'm 24, 5'4"", mixed with black and white, and a BBw. I'm a beautiful young lady if I have to say so myself. I am a single mother of a 1 year old little boy. I have no baby daddy drama. I haven't been with his father since I was 8 weeks pregnant. I am a sweet and caring person. I love hard and my heart is sometimes too big. I'm no fool though and I can be fiesty. I don't party and I don't do drugs or smoke. I drink but not all the time. I love God above everything and I want someone who is committed to God before I submit to them. Marriage is the key but at the right time with the right one. I have always dated black men. That doesn't mean that I won't date outside that race if I can be attracted to you or you sweep me off my feet then I'm open. I love tall guys. Please be 5'10 & above.

This is probably the third time I've tried to find something meaningful, but no such luck. I'm a full time student at UNT and I also work full time, which means I'm an extremely busy girl. I'm hoping to find someone as ambitious as I am and that can give me a much needed push when necessary. I love to sing, read, and sit on the porch to enjoy a nice cold beer. I'm much more of a homebody than anything else, but I do love going out occasionally.

I don't care much about appearance and I definitely don't care about race. Age doesn't really matter, but I am 22. I care a lot more about personality, intellect, and ambition. If you think that we can make a meaningful connection, respond with a picture and little bit about yourself. Of course, I'll also send a picture. Put your favorite NFL team in the subject line.

That is funny and can actually hold my attention with witty banter?

That doesn't think ""u"" is a replacement for the word you? And realizes that good grammar is important?

That has a job with actual earning potential and realizes that asking that doesn't make me a gold digger?

That is not going to send me a dick pic or engage in sexual banter right off the bat?

That has a good relationship with their family?

I am brand new to this Craigslist personal thing so bare with me lol. I have a homebody, that don't do too much of the clubbing scenes. Don't get me wrong I like to have fun, just not the type that feels the need to be in the clubs every weekend. I am a live band spoken words type of get out. I love to cook, read, watch movies, listen to music, dine, travel and I loooove sports. I am looking for something and someone that doesn't mind coming together as one and having the finer things in life. No that doesn't mean money and big house with 10 cars, I am not looking to build with someone that is about to be content one woman and making the best of it. I am about to move to the Atl area again in the next month, and will love to kick off something before I come to stay. I don't smoke and I rarely drink. I don't mind if you just don't be an alcoholic lol, not looking for someone crazy or a stalker either..... feel free to message me if you are interested your pic gets mine. Race is not an issue, I've never dated outside of my race but I'm open to it. NO CATFISHING PLS LOL

IF YOU DONT HAVE A PICTURE OR REAL CONVERSATION PLEASE BYPASS ME. I'm new to CL Personals but I'm not desperate nor am I dumb. If you cant send a picture through email but have to get my number to send me one....and have no real conversation BYPASS ME. I'm not fixing to waste my time or argue with grown men about something as simple as a picture or a detail about you. I would like to get somewhat of a feel of who I am chatting with. Its always one that spoils it for everyone so with that being said respect my wishes, we swap pictures regardless of looks and we got to have real conversation through a few emails before I send you my number. That way no one time is wasted....ITS ALWAYS ONE. lol What a way to go trying this personals thing out.

It's funny, because all these new-fangled apps and websites keep cropping up, like Tinder and Zoosk and whatever else, but rather than making things easier, I think they've actually made things worse. People's attention spans are down to nothing. No one wants to get to know each other, they just want to fuck. Why bother nurturing anything with potential when there's something new and shiny a swipe away?

I suppose I'm an old fashioned girl in that I'm just looking for someone sweet, down to earth and funny. Someone I can have good conversations with, someone with a good head on their shoulders. Someone who is up for cuddling and adventures, staying in, going out, and fun - both in AND out of the bedroom. You know, like a normal relationship, where you spend time together, talk, get to know each other....

Maybe CL is the wrong place to look, too. Who knows? But it's worth a shot. I need a good, normal, sane man who is maybe equally disillusioned by how available ""dating"" is nowadays.

If you are between 25 and 40, have your shit together, are feeling lonely and want something more than just a hookup...then here's what you'll get in me. A sarcastic, sassy, energetic, cute and smart woman. Chubby, 27, a gamer, a geek, an intellectual, who enjoys movies, video games, cooking, being outside, live music, reading and a whole lot more. Sexy and sensual, caring, passionate, loyal, a chatterbox, a coffee addict and looking for the right guy (in all the wrong places).

Send me a message with ""Old School Love"" in the title and let me know about you! Maybe we can catch a spark that'll turn into something bigger. Your picture gets mine :)

We were married in the early 80s. Thinking of you and those massive mammaries I used to caress, suckle on. They were spectacular. You said I would miss them. Yes, I do. Shame we were so different and couldn't work things out. Big breasts are awesome. Are you still in the area? I would love to feast on them again. Lap your love nest. Growing the goatee back which makes for a very fine womb broom. Seeking that monogamous relationship again. Your first name begins with C. Reading this and mot her? Curious? This is Michael.

I'm looking for a submissive female interested in a long term, casual relationship to start. Things may grow from there, but that's what I'm wanting for now. I'm a 35 year old white male, who is 6' 4"", and a little overweight, but I am working out to help with that.

I'm looking for a woman who I enjoy spending time with, so age and race aren't an issue. Neither is experience. My main concern is that if you smoke you be willing to do so outside of my home/car. Being kinky is a plus as well.

If you are interested, feel free to reply, but be serious. I don't want to play games, so if you start playing around or don't seem interested, don't expect me to keep talking to you. Change the subject to 'Toy' so I know you aren't spam, otherwise you might not get a reply at all. Messages with pics get top priority. ;)

There really isn't a category for what I am seeking. I am married but I am not really seeking something that would, typically, be described as ""casual, nsa"".

Conversely, I would like to actually have a relationship that could be exclusive and long-term within the context of my situation...the fact that I am married. 

Maybe, ultimately, it's not possible but I would like to give it a shot. 

I am attractive, white, fit, intelligent and athletic. I shave my head and have a goatee. 

I would like to find a woman with similar qualities, except the shaved head and goatee. 

Age is irrelevant to me but, a starting range might be 35-45. Younger or older could work depending upon your attitude and how you have taken care of yourself. 

Either attached or single is ok but, I want this to be as drama-free as possible. 

If you are interested or would like to know more, I would love to hear from you. Thanks.

If you are single/divorced and are wanting/needing a companion from time to time then let's talk and see where it goes. I am a white collar man living in DFW wanting someone like me in the area. We can talk online to see if we are compatible, if so we can meet in a public place. (I am not a crazy). If we then feel the need to pursue a relationship, then we can take it to the next level. I am not looking for a haram but just one nice, lovely, caring lady with similar needs to mine. If this is you then I am waiting to hear from you.

I was thinking about all the ebbs and flows of life as I saw a couple of introspective films the other day, and I've fallen in love, as it were, with a beautiful actress almost twice my age. This has me thinking: how would it be to commence a passionate romance with someone older than me. 40s perhaps? This might be temporary but I know it can be fun. We meet, and go on adventures, and make passionate love. Maybe we meet at a hotel like Benjamin Braddock and Mrs. Robinson in ""The Graduate."" Maybe maybe maybe I go your place, or you come to mine.

Single (divorced no kids) guy, white, athletic build, got all my hair and teeth, no criminal, or drug, or alcohol history ever. I am 57 but don't look or act it. Have a great job, car, home. I am a normal, happy with life guy. I am easy going non drama see the glass half full person, I enjoy meeting new people and am comfortable in my own skin. I am divorced, no children and any and all baggage been disposed of. Never a criminal, drug, or alcohol history never seen the inside of a jail. I like to travel, fish, love the water, dance, go out pretty much all the normal things people do, I also like to try new places, and explore new places. Love to cook and BBQ. Love conversation be it important issues or just simply talking in general. Like to sit on the patio watching stars on a dark nite or listening to nature wake up in the morning. Like almost all types of music, I am a Christian and a believer with a relationship with God but do not push it on anybody else. I do not seek perfection and I don't judge anybody its not my job. Want to find someone to become friends with and see where it may lead. No interest in hookups, I truly wish to find my best friend and life partner and that's a journey that has its own pace. I do believe in romance, manners, respect and true love, its not just for movies or songs just takes the right two people. I am honest and trust till reason not to. I love animals and kids and don't mind if you are a smoker. If any interest is peaked say hello and lets talk, but either way hope you have success on here. Be happy to send recent photo. No fakes or spammers I wont respond.

Okay, first I am clean, not into drugs, and I am disease free. That being said, I am seeking for only one FWB, someone to develop a close friendship with and enjoy life's many adventures. I am open to age and race, all women are beautiful in their own way. In other words, you being bbw, skinny, curvy, young, mature, old, or whichever you are, you are more than welcome to reply. All I ask for is honesty and be serious about wanting only one fwb. I have not been sexually active for over a year, and I am in no hurry to jump into bed, sorry ladies. Now about me, I am single, not perfect, enjoy a variety of things ranging all over. Lastly, I have learned this is a determining factor for you all. I am uncircumcised and cum quickly, but more than once. Throwing that out there. Remember its been awhile for me? lol Perhaps there is a woman that would take the challenge to build my stamina again.

http://dallas.craigslist.org/ftw/m4w/5407511781.html,Your Dom,"
I am seeking for a particular woman that craves a Dominant. What I want, a woman that has a desire to serve, learn, submit, and understand the dynamics between a sub and Dom are actually loving in nature. A woman that wants to be pushed to new limits in every aspect of her life, to achieve success, and needs guidance.

About me, I am naturally Dominant, believe me I have struggled with this in past relationships trying to subdue my ""dominance"". I did not know who I was, until I embraced my urges, I am not here to play games. I only seek one woman that knows she is truly submissive down deep. A woman that needs attention, instruction, love, discipline, and much more. I will have many expectations for you, many women will not be able to commit to such a dynamic relationship. It takes a special woman to relinquish control, but it does not make her weak, and I will cherish the fact that you have given me control. This will be a learning process for you, I am patient, understanding, and quite affectionate with the right woman. I have experience, and all the decisions I make are always what is in the best interest for you, us. This is merely not about sex, it goes much deeper, a relationship with stronger bonds than what most couples have. A level of trust that is the foundation, and always will be.

I need for you to understand that this post in not about sex, yes that is one of the benefits, but it's about forging a bond between a Dom and sub, creating a deep level of connection, trust, and love.

I'm currently too busy for a real relationship and do not have the time to invest into one. That being said, Im not seeking for anything serious. Just being upfront. Now, I seek for only one fwb, one that is clean and disease free. Im clean and disease free as well and want to remain that way. I have no requirements other than you being female, crazy Ill still get responses from guys...Anyways, so dont be shy, age and size does not bother me. Im not a bad looking guy, not a hot model unfortunately lol. Im open minded and hope to find someone seeking for the same. Or perhaps you have a different situation, I wont judge.

Hello, my name is Jared. I am 26, Hispanic and love to laugh. I like going out and trying new things. Also like a night in on the couch watching a good movie and cooking. I like watching sports, action movies, almost anything really and comedy (anything that makes me laugh is a good thing lol) I listen to mostly all music. I like to write in my spare time. I do like watching anime series and movies because I feel they can tell a story in a way no other type of media can. I play a few games and like watching the comic book movies that come out in theaters. I am not a full nerd/geek but I have my qualities of both and I am proud of them :) I am looking for someone who loves to smile and laugh. Someone who is there for the people they love. I would like someone who likes to try new adventures because I want to try new adventures. I have fallen behind on getting out and living life to fullest and I plan to change that. Someone who is independent but also at times will allow others to step in and be there for them. Someone who is trustworthy and who I can confine too. I am looking for someone who has best friend qualities as well with all the caring and love that goes with a relationship. Any other questions feel free to ask. Put your favorite color in subject line. Can kik me at jared1589 as well

Always remember to smile and laugh :)

This is a real ad, please do not flag.

I am a 48 year old, white male, living in the uptown area of Dallas. I am looking for a submissive white female in her 20's, who is HWP. I am strongly attracted to petite females, therefore, if you are an extremely petite female, A cup, who is submissive please respond. I am unconcerned with looks but more a particular body frame and mind set.

I want to make clear that I am a Dom and not a masochist. I am not into pain or anything which would lead to long term, noticeable bruising, nor am I interested in choke games. I do not share with other men, therefore, I am not looking for a slave or pet. If you are interested in pain, choking, being shared with random men, being exploited, financial domination, or any other masochistic activities, then we are not compatible. This is NOT a relationship where you are punished for disobedience, you either follow my rules, as law, or be gone; it is that simple. You will dress as told (yes you will be pampered), speak when told to speak, and only make eye contact when given permission, and only with those people I allow. You must be completely submissive to me; I do NOT like to hear ""no"", therefore you need to be open minded and willing to please. This means that whatever pleases me then you do it. This relationship is not strictly for sexual gratification; while you will do whatever is necessary to please me in this regard it also applies to daily life. It is best if you are bisexual, or in the alternative, understand that you WILL do what is necessary to please me. You must be able to support yourself. While you do not have to make a great deal of money, I am not looking for a sb. It is best if you are educated; this is a real relationship and we will actually talk to one another. This is a serious, long term relationship which could lead to 24/7. Therefore, I understand it takes time to develop this sort of relationship, and it is built upon a foundation of trust and cannot possible form over night. I will screen potential candidates via Kik. I do NOT respond to emails, CL is a spammers world and you must prove that you are a real person before I disclose any personal information. Fritz1112. We will chat for awhile to see if this is viable for both parties. We will meet in public first.

This is a real ad, do not flag, I also understand that to many this seems like a cliche where an older man is looking for a 20 something, however, that is irrelevant to me. For those who frown upon this type of relationship, you are entitled to your opinion, but understand that I don't care what you think. I want what I want. Please be discreet.
