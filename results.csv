I'm just a regular, laid back, down to earth guy looking to meet a nice girl. I appreciate the little things in life. I love to make people laugh, and I have a sarcastic, dry sense of humor. I work full time at AAA and a few nights at Stop & Shop. Bonus points if you're a Red Sox fan and/or have a dog.

Don't worry, I won't ask to ""Netflix and chill."" I'm better then that. I don't even have Netflix anyway. 

Please be D&D; free! No pic = no reply. Please put REAL in the subject.

Please read fully. This is NOT a post for sex, or anything like that.

I am an out of work professional and am available for those chores/tasks (AKA, ""Honey, can you fix this, or put up that, or move that?"") How many times have you wished that you had a resource that could help you with various things around your home?

I am an engineer, have had a thorough background check, do not have any criminal history, do not smoke, and do not do drugs of any kind. I am merely offering my services to those that would appreciate them.

I am in my early 50s and am handy. I am quite adept at installing technology, fixing things around the home, and especially good with computers. I am also available for tutoring any science (except biology) and any math up to and including Calculus I. I have been told that I am a gentleman, easy to talk with, and polite. I have also been told that I have a guy next door (easygoing) personality.

Rates are based on the task and quite reasonable. I live in Jamestown and am serving the surrounding communities and South County.

Again, this is a serious post, and I am in no way looking for anything more than to provide you with a handyman type of service. I am after all very much a gentleman.

Thank you for reading.

PS
No job is too small, and when in doubt, just ask.

I want to be up front we are going to email a couple of times before I just hand out my phone number. I want to be sure the person I am talking to is real. I do not like to talk on the phone so please do not call me. I am putting this in the platonic section because I have no problems with us being friends. I will say I do like flirting even if you are my friend. I am not opposed to things developing if it happens but I do not want to lead anyone on and not what I am looking for but no one knows.

Have you ever wanted confirmation, or clarification about what is happening in your life?

Do your own thoughts at times distort or override your own intuitive instincts?

Are you curious, as to how accurate and meaningful a reading would be to you?

I am blessed to have worked with my gifts extensively over the past few years. I do readings for friends, and other business associates. My accuracy in discerning and reading energy with very little information has been affirmed over and over again.

What I am offering for you today is a simple one card reading. All that I ask is that you reply to this post and provide your ""First Name"" in the subject line.

If you find the one card reading relevant, you can ask for more information about other types of readings I do. I do these readings for ""free"" and will never ask you for money. 

I am a male in my early 40's who doesn't live in your area. I am not looking for a date. I am simple offering to share my gifts with you. Have a blessed and wonderful day.

http://providence.craigslist.org/stp/5423631720.html,Would you like a sort of Servant? - m4w,"
Hello... how are you? Thank you for reading.

I wanted to post this ad and try to explain this concept in a little bit of detail. For starters, let me say that I am a submissive... shocker I know. I have called myself one for most of my adult life, although I shake my head at some of the things I used to do when I was younger. But that's not really the point. The point is, I've been around as a submissive for a long time and I like to think I know what I'm doing.

I would like to be a servant to someone. Beyond that, what I genuinely want to do is to ""give the gift of anything"". To be more specific. I would like to meet someone for somewhere in the ballpark of 2-3 hours at a time. During that time I would like for her to consider me a tool, an object to use for her benefit, period. I have some limits, which we can discuss ahead of time, but not all that many. We would have a safe-word in case things went off the rails. But beyond that, I will do as I am told, period. This can apply to a great many things, but as just a few suggestions. I can cook, clean, do housework, yard work, other manual labor. I can give massages, foot rubs, and other personal services. I can be a dummy to hang clothes on if you so desire. I can be a footrest or bench, or you can have me dance around like an idiot for your amusement. Be clever, be creative, and don't be hesitant.

You may wish to know what I am looking for in return... and that is just it. What I want, genuinely, is to be an object for just that period of time. I want you to not be hesitant to very simply use me. I want you to tell me what to do with no thought towards what I do OR do not want. At no time should my pleasure factor into your thoughts... but for that matter neither should my discomfort. If it so happens I enjoy something you want done, then so be it. If it so happens I don't particularly like something, then so be it as well. I will do my best not to show my preferences in the same way that a toaster doesn't have an opinion about the sort of bread you put inside it. 

My enjoyment in this is, very simply, giving you the gift of whatever you want. I want to say the word ""anything"", and for the most part, mean it. Being allowed to give that gift is what I am seeking.

So I am not sure if this ad will garner much response, but I am more than happy to talk it out with anyone who might even be a bit curious.

I am an older gentle-man who is very lonely. I'm gentle, sweet, passionate and kind but that doesn't help my situation. You see, I'm married... to a wonderful woman who has no desire to have sex, lust, passion or kink of any kind. It's a long time thing with a big extended family and if I left purely for sexual reasons, it would destroy the whole family. I tried looking in the ""Casual"" area but the only thing there are fakes and scams and prostitutes. I wish that I had someone to talk to and maybe get some feelings for to develop some trust and desire with. I'm not a guy who's done this before and I have no idea where to turn or look for a special friend. I am on the dominant side and love submissive feminine women who like hugs, kissing and holding each other. It's been a long time. I am clean, drug and disease free and don't smoke. I would love to find a discreet friend to chat with and maybe more. Someone to get to know, get a coffee, visit with once or twice a week. You can be in your 20's to 40's and petite to slightly plump and you must be okay with my situation and like tall husky broad shouldered men. Hope you say hello...

Hey there. 45 yo professional male here, in town on business the week of Feb. 22nd. I have no idea what kind of fun I can find within a reasonable distance of Franklin, but I sure am willing to find out. Company is paying for everything, so if there are any ladies out there who can show me some good places to hang out I would be very appreciative. Age and race doesn't matter, and I'm up for just about anything. Drop me a line if you're curious. Hope ya have a great night!

Subject pretty much states it. I want someone who's down to go on adventures or something with me. Essentially the Chewbacca to my Han Solo. I really want to go ""UFO hunting"", which entitles getting high as fuck and looking at the stars in like Charlestown or something. I'm a 22 yr old comp sci major, comic book geek and pizza enthusiast that likes music too much and is hella awkward sometimes. I was also voted most likely to suck eggs, and I actually say hella unironically.

Your choice of movie. I want to get out this weekend with someone. I typically connect better with women - men are hard to crack. 

I'm not interested in exchanging pics. I don't need to see you to see a movie with you. If you have another idea of something to do, like ice skating or... ANYTHING I'm open to suggestions. I would prefer someone that shares some of the things I enjoy. I love the outdoors. Hikes, camping, walks, beaches. I love enjoying the sounds that emanate from forests. I love many songs and don't know the lyrics to most of them but sing along anyway. The sound and rhythm just speaks to me. Some artists: maroon 5, Adele, Benny Goodman, Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, AC/DC, DJ Tiesto, Zomboy, Trace Adkins are a small selection.

I'm old school and love old things. Again, they speak to me and I hear and respect their stories. And I'm not talking about actually speaking. I'm not crazy, just quirky.

The shallow stuff: Superbly good looking with blond hair, chiseled jaw, 6'1"" tall with an athletic body. Fabulous red mustache included. ...do you believe me?

I have many older friends but none my age, so let's try to stay in that range, but the number of revolutions around the sun can be arbitrary. Women only need apply. No girls accepted. I'm talking mentally/emotionally. I look forward to communicating with you via legacy methods in the near future.

http://providence.craigslist.org/stp/5424438468.html,Might be the strangest post you've read today. - m4w,"
Ok well, I'm married, for starters. I proposed something to my wife a little while ago, which she accepted and has been pursuing with vigor, and I'd like to see if anyone out there in craigslist land might wish to help continue the process.

In essence, I asked her how she would feel about beginning to treat me like a dumb, sexualized object... you can use alternate words for that statement, but let's keep it classy for now. :) The idea is to see how regular treatment over time might alter my behavior and/or thinking. So far, we are both pleased with the results.

I am looking for people who might want to reinforce this idea in my mind. I am certainly not looking for anything more than a friendship of sorts, but a part of this friendship should be over-emphasizing my looks while downplaying my brain. Patronize me whenever possible and just assume that you're smarter than me and will always be correct.

Ideally, I'd like this to be just a part of a real friendship. I'd still like to learn about you and for you to learn about me. And if anyone wants to hear it, I'd love to have someone new around to talk to about the steps my wife has taken already.

So what do you think?

I'm a male in my 20's. I am willing to cook healthy foods (using my own resources) and clean the house in exchange for a couch to stay. My living situation is very unstable right now. 

If you have extra space at your place and want to have a healthier lifestyle you will be pleased to have me staying with your for a little while. 


A bit about me:

I am someone who has extensive knowledge of nutrition and is a very good cook. I also pick out the best foods at the market. Its a bit of an obsession to be honest. I usually cook two to three times a day.

I need a couch or bed for at least two weeks until I can get my living situation and finances straightened out. My aunt (whom I am staying with temporarily) prefers to live with her husband and refuses any monetary help from me. I cannot stay there for long and need to go elsewhere.

Trying something new...

I am basically here because I have many years experience as a service submissive. By that I mean that I have, in the past, done tons of housework, done lots of dishes, laundry, errands, plenty of scrubbing floors and cleaning rooms, etc, for different women. It's something I enjoy doing, and I ask little if anything in return.

The basic idea is that I would be there to make your life easier in any way that I could. And yes, I am being completely serious about this. This is not, in any way, about sex. About the most intimate I would be willing to get would be a massage or a pedicure (both of which I am great at). That is why this ad is in this section.

So what do you think? Can we talk it over?

Ok, so this is what's going on. I am a guy, but i am NOT looking for another guy for myself. Rather i am looking for a GAY male (and by gay i don't mean Bi-Sexual, or on the fence) to spend time with my girlfriend. I DON'T mean this in a sexual way, or i wouldn't have posted this here. So we are both married, but yet love to spend time together. Only issue is I don't get a whole lot of time to see her as i have other commitments. We love each other, but she is getting restless for the need to be able to spend more time doing things with a male partner. I am hoping that i MAY be able to find a male is secure enough in his sexuality that he just wants a female friend as a friend....nothing else. This is NOT an attempt to pass off my girlfriend for a threesome, or anything else of a sexual nature. We just want her to be able to have someone to do more things with that i am available to do. She is an awesome woman, smart, funny, and most of all has a spectacular personality. So if you aren't secure enough for this, or you are a perverted freak, don't bother. I don't want to hear any negative comments, i have heard them all before. We will both have to be comfortable with the person(s) (if you already have a partner) in order for this to work. Hope to hear back from you , and please be respectful.



PS!!! Ok, just so i can weed out people who are not willing, i will be asking for a picture. While this is PLATONIC, she is a very pretty woman, and as such will not be looking for someone who wouldn't normally be a match for her. So please don't be offended, this isn't a beauty contest, but we are not looking for the hunchback of Notre dame either.

Greetings, how are you today? Thank you for reading my ad.

I just figured this was worth a shot at least. Long story short, I'm married and I love my wife. I am not here looking to cheat on her, or hook up on the side, or anything at all like that. We often work opposite schedules, and I'm rather lonely a lot of the time, and I would love to have someone to talk to.

I'm 33 and I live in Providence. I think for the most part I am looking for someone to converse with, occasionally meet for lunch, and even more occasionally catch a movie or something along those lines. I am very nice, friendly, a great listener and I like to think I get along well with the vast majority of the people I meet in my life. I'm college educated, gainfully employed, and for the most part I enjoy my life quite a bit... I just find (as many 30 somethings do) that making friends has gotten a lot harder than it used to be.

That's about all I have to say, but I'm going to play a dirty trick at the end of this ad. The title of my ad isn't an empty boast. There is something I have to offer than very few people on here can. Any guesses? Are you curious? Message me!
