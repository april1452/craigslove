I just enjoy some nice email conversations only. I'm a single woman in my mid 40's. Would prefer someone over 40. Tell me a little about yourself and what you enjoy doing. All variations of attachment or not are welcome to reply. Since its only email!!! 

One liners or someone who can't read and just sends me their stats, phone number or pic will be deleted. That also means you don't know anything about how to start a regular conversation if your only replying in that way. If your looking to hook up or meet anyone then you are looking in the wrong section. NOT LOOKING TO MEET!!! 

I'm only posting in the ""platonic"" section. If your going to use your phone/ipad an you can't type all that much or don't want to make the effort to really type a decent reply back. Then move along an find someone else to reply to.

I want someone who really can carry on a conversation via email only. Who can talk about whatever comes to mind about what's been going on in their day/lives. Someone with a sense of humor is a plus. Who doesn't get offended easily and can go with the flow of the conversation.

I work full time at AAA and a few nights at Stop & Shop. Bonus points if you're a Red Sox fan and/or have a dog.

Don't worry, I won't ask to ""Netflix and chill."" I'm better then that. I don't even have Netflix anyway.

Please read fully. This is NOT a post for sex, or anything like that.

I am an out of work professional and am available for those chores/tasks (AKA, ""Honey, can you fix this, or put up that, or move that?"") How many times have you wished that you had a resource that could help you with various things around your home?

I am an engineer, have had a thorough background check, do not have any criminal history, do not smoke, and do not do drugs of any kind. I am merely offering my services to those that would appreciate them.

I am in my early 50s and am handy. I am quite adept at installing technology, fixing things around the home, and especially good with computers. I am also available for tutoring any science (except biology) and any math up to and including Calculus I. I have been told that I am a gentleman, easy to talk with, and polite. I have also been told that I have a guy next door (easygoing) personality.

Rates are based on the task and quite reasonable. I live in Jamestown and am serving the surrounding communities and South County.

Again, this is a serious post, and I am in no way looking for anything more than to provide you with a handyman type of service. I am after all very much a gentleman.

Thank you for reading.

PS
No job is too small, and when in doubt, just ask.

Hello there. Thank you for taking the time to look at my ad. I love to text sort of a hobby. I also love talking to new people. I want to be up front we are going to email a couple of times before I just hand out my phone number. I want to be sure the person I am talking to is real. I do not like to talk on the phone so please do not call me. I am putting this in the platonic section because I have no problems with us being friends. I will say I do like flirting even if you are my friend. I am not opposed to things developing if it happens but I do not want to lead anyone on and not what I am looking for but no one knows. If there is anything that you want to know about me feel free to ask. Please change the subject line to something original so I can weed out the bots.

Have you ever wanted confirmation, or clarification about what is happening in your life?

Do your own thoughts at times distort or override your own intuitive instincts?

Are you curious, as to how accurate and meaningful a reading would be to you?

I am blessed to have worked with my gifts extensively over the past few years. I do readings for friends, and other business associates. My accuracy in discerning and reading energy with very little information has been affirmed over and over again.

What I am offering for you today is a simple one card reading. All that I ask is that you reply to this post and provide your ""First Name"" in the subject line.

If you find the one card reading relevant, you can ask for more information about other types of readings I do. I do these readings for ""free"" and will never ask you for money. 

I am a male in my early 40's who doesn't live in your area. I am not looking for a date. I am simple offering to share my gifts with you. Have a blessed and wonderful day.
