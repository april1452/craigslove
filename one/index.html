            We used sklearn library to assign TF/IDF weights to all our craigslist personal ads, then perform k-means clustering. So far we played around with clustering only the Providence posts, because the data from all the cities combined was too big (for now). Here are the results from 2-means clustering (i.e. the top terms used for each of 2 clusters) which are pretty interesting:
            <br>
            top terms for cluster 0:
            <br>
            host
            clean
            cock
            stats
            suck
            discreet
            free
            nice
            <br>
            top terms for cluster 1:
            <br>
            love
            fun
            time
            interested
            meet
            nice
            email
            real                               
            <br>
            <br>
            Here are the results from another iteration, of 5-means clustering. It seems like there is a lot of overlap.                          
            <br>
            top terms for cluster 0:

            host
            masculine
            safe
            ddf
            <br>
            top terms for cluster 1:
            <br>

            bottom
            host

            fuck
            oral

            top terms for cluster 2:
            <br>

            suck
            stats
            big
            nice
            host
            <br>
            top terms for cluster 3:
            <br>

            suck
            big
            love
            host
            ass
            <br>
            top terms for cluster 4:
            <br>

            stats
            fun
            ddf

            We were attempting to perform clustering on a very large data set, and the machine on which we were running our code didn’t have sufficient RAM to perform operations of that magnitude. After consulting our mentor Vinh, we are considering options such as using a sparse matrix implementation to be less computationally intensive given the high sparsity of our data set, or principal component analysis to reduce its dimensionality. More simply, we’re also going to see if switching to a machine with more RAM is sufficient for our needs.

            We plan on using different clustering algorithms because some may perform better than others. We also plan on running clustering algorithms on larger datasets. It would be interesting to compare clusters across different geographic regions. We may create a naive front end to display the findings.
