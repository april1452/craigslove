    We created a random post generator to randomly generate posts on craigslist personals using a markov chain.
There are 6 different categories for posts: ['m4m', 'm4w', 'msr', 'stp', 'w4m', 'w4w'].
For each one of these categories, our model has a different transition matrix for the markov chain used.
In the transition matrix, each row represents a word, with special rows representing the start of a post, the end of a post, and punctuation marks.
The transition matrix T was obtained by going through all the posts for a specific category and counting the number of times the following word appeared after it. Afterwards, every row was normalized to sum to 1.
T[i][j] represents the probability that the word represented by column j follows the word represented by row i. Here, words include words as well as the special START, END symbols and punctuation marks.
Each word was lowercased because we believed it would create better results; some people tend to capitalize random letters in words.
<br><br>
To randomly generate a post, we start at the START row in the transition matrix T. We sample from the distribution represented by the START row; suppose we sampled column c. Then we go to row c and repeat this process until we reach the END row.
<br><br>
We also generated the "most probable post" for each of the 6 categories. To do this, at each row in the transition matrix T, we looked for the highest value T[i][j] given i to get the next state (word) represented by j.
