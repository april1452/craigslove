Friends first; lets get to know each other!!

I am looking to make new friends. Any good relationship starts out as friends first and in due time can evolve into a meaningful relationship. Someone who just wants to have a good time without pressure, be yourself and I will do the same. Personally I am an easy going, laid back can be funny as hell, very sarcastic and like to laugh rarely get stressed or become angry. I will make fun of you as well of myself. Life is short so I just like to enjoy the days as they go by. I will at times do random acts of kindness to others just to make myself feel better and to make our world a better place for all. As to what I like to do the laundry list can go on and on, but will try almost anything once. Some of the things I enjoy most are trying new restaurants (ethnic ones with a green B in the window) road trips speeding to our destination, the outdoors and cooking and yes I am a good cook. Quiet moments together just enjoying the company of one and other; lets not forget acting our shoe size not our age.

One thing that is very important to me is that you are an honest and real, a kind and caring person who speaks the truth. Someone who has feelings and is not afraid to express then, help each other out in both times of good and bad.I don't care what you do fore work or where you live or what you drive, just be a good hearted and a real person that hard to find this city we call home. Ideally I am looking for someone who is a least 35.

What I would like to get out of this post, is to make some new friends and maybe just maybe a best friend and a lover. Someone to grow old and grey and tooth-less with and have medacare buy us a pare of Hoverrounds.


If you have read everything I have written great. Because there is so much spam or BS on these listings I will only reply back if you answer a few basic questions in no particular order.

Where do you live, a zip code will work. Just want to make shore were both in the same time zone?

What decade where you born in?

Should I be a monkey suite or jeans and tee shirt person?

Are you just as happy eating at an ethnic restaurant with a green B in the window as you might be at a fine dining restaurant?

In all fairness hear are my answers to my questions.

Life is too short to waste it, so finding a friend is my goal, to share special moments and conversations, which may become endearing, captivating, adventurous and downright fun.
I want something deeper than just superficial intimacy. I want to connect on a level so few have had the privilege to achieve with that special friend. Finding someone to chat and share everyday things, talking about our life's journey and all the choices we've made good or bad. 
I don't know why certain people are placed in front of your path, coincidences, fate or sheer happenstance but nevertheless, everyone I have come into contact with have been cherished and beloved memories. Are you the one this post was meant for, I sure hope you are, I know you're out there? Age to me is just a number to me, I hope it holds no real significance for you either. I am able to relate to you whether your 21 or 55, having the confidence in my ability to engage in great conversations with you.
I dare you to find out if I'm what is needed, to help get you through a boring day. Remember we all need someone in our life's from time to time to make us feel alive.

Looking for over 38 something. I just can't get into hanging out with guys. So I live near the beach. I have my own place. I have a extra room and looking for a roommate (I'm not asking you to move in , just telling you about myself, hey want to move in?). I'm also looking for a platonic friend. I like non Hollywood blockbuster films. I like old classic movies. I like to cook and go out to eat, the full range of culinary delights. I'm very active and I'm really into lounging. I'll drink anything but moderately. Into casual beach cruising bike rides, I have an extra bike in the garage. I have tons of free time. A night owl by nature. Single never married no ex wife or kids. Average height, easy on the eyes, I clean up well, slim (not skinny) and very fit. I garden and like hanging out and in, going out finding place where there are no crowds. It's fun to find places where there is no competition for space. I'm open to get into what you are into. I'm up for learning the many things that I don't know. So in short I'm a fun and fit and active and I also like to be lazy, I'm a great catch but I'm looking for a platonic friend. Let's make plans for the weekend, let's get chummy. I will send my pic first if you like.

I'm looking for someone to do things with. I am married hence the platonic ad but an occasional hug when something happens worth hugging about is cool. My wife doesn't enjoy or have time for the things I enjoy so I thought I would find someone to do things with who does. I travel occasionally to Vegas, Reno, the SF Bay area among other places. Would like to get to Washington DC and Boston again too. I like to sightsee but it isn't much fun to do alone. It's more fun when there is someone I can share it with occasionally. Much more enjoyable when you can turn to someone and say ""Wow"" and discuss it. I drove to Rocky Mountain National Park which is at the peak of the mountains but when I got there, I sat a bit and then drove back down. Anyway, if you don't get it by now you better pass on by. Would also like to motorcycle up the coast so you have to fit on the back of a bike or have your own to share in that experience.

I'm in my 50's but age doesn't really matter. Just have to enjoy life. 6'4"" 265# Caucasian if that matters. Average looks at best and could stand to lose a few pounds or 20. 

If your interested in a new friend and an occasion adventure, please reply. We can text or talk and see if we have anything in common then go from there. If you send a picture I will reciprocate.
Please tell me about yourself and your ideas. So I know you read the post, please put Boston in response header.

I am an older bi guy who enjoys posing nude for others, and am offering to pose nude for student and amateur artists, either on a one-on-one basis (for another male or female) or for a small group (single sex or mixed sex). I am a regular, circumcised, Italian man ... I am heavyset ... 

I do not consider myself a professional model (though I have posed for a few pro artists in the past). I do not charge for students and amateurs. I am open minded, will do everything from classic to erotic poses ... am alright with the artist actually posing me ... you need not be a well accomplished artist. I am just as happy posing for someone who just wants to see if they can draw as I am with someone with proven skills. Oh yes, I am also willing to pose along with other models.

My availability is on most weekday mornings and some early afternoons.

Are you interested? If so, respond with some very basic information ... What is your status (student? Amateur? Artist? etc.) and what is the situation (one on one, small group, etc) and what type of art and how will it be used. When and how long will you need me? Where?.

I ask you provide as much information as possible as I do not appreciate one line responses and endless emails. If that is what I sense is happening, I will just not respond . the photograph with this posting is me....

I do hope to hear from you

How about an encouraging and uplifting conversation ... platonic, even sister/brother-like? Nothing nude (except maybe we bare our souls), and nothing inappropriate. Not expecting to meet in person, but yes to a meeting of minds and hearts.

If you genuinely want to talk about the important things in life - love, relationships, parenting, careers, faith, and others ... all those good things that make life worth living - then we should get along very well.

Maybe also talk about the joys or challenges we face -- in marriage or just life; how we are being stretched, possibly overwhelmed, how we have overcome, or how we are being overtaken ... with grief, with fear, with loss.

Professional, happily married, mostly sane, many interests, kids, like to encourage and build people up in their important relationships; maybe we can get some ideas to better love the people in our lives.

If this sounds interesting, let me know!

NOT looking for a date, a hookup, a relationship, or anything else. No expectations at all. I'm a good looking, in shape, professional guy, good hygiene, very easy to talk to and get along with, just interested in trying something like this once in my life.

This may sound like a very strange request, but I'm looking for a fit / attractive person who wants to cuddle, or hang out together in close proximity. 

Watch a movie, have a couple drinks, conversation (or no talking) and just relax. No expectations no pressure. Nothing sexual at all - really. I just miss human contact without it being in any way about sex. 

I'm settling back into LA after a couple years overseas. I work long hours with a very demanding job, and I don't have much of a social circle - and don't feel comfortable turning to a friend for this. 

I'm open to men or women - totally different dynamic with either. I'm the boss at work but want to just relaxing/melting with someone behind closed doors where I don't have to be in charge, which is why I'm open to male contact - if that makes sense. 

I'm very fit and an athlete (have attached a couple of body photos), good looking, educated and normal - a catch, if you will. Not bat shit crazy, down to earth white guy who isn't looking for anything jacked up. 

Open to younger or older, as long as you're fit, clean, reasonably attractive and aren't boring. I'm very optimistic and love to laugh, so a sense of humor goes a long way.

Drinks, food and/or movie is on me. Just be normal, cool and not a pro, please. Thanks.

Hey my name is Nader, I'm just a normal down to earth 27 year old guy who likes to go out to different nice restaurants and have good conversation or even a silly one. It would be fun to go with someone who likes to go as consistently as I do (1-3 times a week?) The best part of it... I always take care of the bill. 

If you're interested, send me an email with a little about yourself... Perhaps we can meet over coffee 😜😏😊

I'm an Asian guy, and very Americanized. I'm just looking for a platonic friend. Age 30 to 40, but doesn't matter too much as long as you're mature. I'm not interested in going to clubs or anything too crazy. I live in the South Bay and work in Westwood, so I can hang out anywhere near those two spots. My intent is to just find a friend to hang out with, grab a bite to eat, see a movie, etc. More than anything, I just like good interesting conversation. I've tried this a number of times, and met some cool people, but it usually fades out for one reason or another... boyfriend, not interested, etc....which is perfectly fine. But, I want to keep trying to meet more people.

I'm korean but I don't speak Korean. I'm very Americanized, but I love asian food, so maybe we can drive to K-town, or San Gabriel valley?

I'm not looking for a relationship, so please keep that in mind. This is for just friendship. No sex, no dating, no expectations, keep it simple.

I'll keep this short for now. Tell me something, anything, about yourself.

I was listening the radio the other day and the host was saying of all the numbers in numerology
The number that might be the best compatibility predictor is your credit rating.

If you think about it...a credit rating certainly does say something for character.
Would you trust your life to someone with 550 credit rating over someone with a 750 rating?
In my life I've come to see people are a lot like their credit rating.
If you know how your credit number is compiled then you know...you don't have to have a lot of money to have great credit.

That being said...if your credit rating is north of 700
My guess is your a responsible person and someone I might like to meet.
I'm a good man, love the out doors, love being creative, I'm easy going and always up for a laugh
Looking to meet a cool, responsible new friend?
Don't be shy...say hi and include a pic

Do you love shopping? Do you wish you had someone along on your shopping excursions for an honest and discerning opinion? You know quite well that a shop keeper and store clerk tell you what you want to hear in order to make the sale. That's where I come in. I'm there to tell you what works and what doesn't, from a man's perspective.

I have been doing this for decades, accompanying women of all ages through malls and boutique districts, giving that much needed man's point of view, with a discerning eye that has worked in fashion, photography, and film. I am not a personal shopper, I am a shopping buddy, your style consultant there to help you look your best, give an honest opinion, and perhaps even save you money - because you know you have clothes in your closet with the tags still on that you will never, ever wear.

My rate is $125 an hour, and I will be that patient shopping friend you've been looking for.

Bonus - Relationship advice from that coveted guy's perspective is included.

If interested, please email your contact information, shopping plans; when and where, and send a photo of yourself in the mirror with the words ""Shopping buddy"" written on your hand for verification.

Thank you for your interest, and good shopping to you.

First off, to the person who wrote a lovely email about people here, I deleted your message. Please feel free to email again.
Greetings, G'day

Aussie Russian Frenchy here who is looking for a new pal. Hoping to meet someone for all sorts of endeavours from errands to walking and hiking to gaming to anything pals do. Someone to text/chat and later hang about with. I'm here for a few months helping a mate. I used to live in LA before though. Moved fro Australia age 13 and went to HS in Rancho. After HS I went back to Australia, France, UK and the PNW. Went back to UK and now here helping a mate. Close friends are far away and the loneliness is a bit of a drag. I'd want to meet new folks out and about but lately it's been pretty difficult for some reason. What the hell is it with people being so into themselves ey? Maybe it's just be but that is what I see. So I thought that I would give this a go even though I've tried making mates thru digital means only to end in weird failure. Flaky folks seemed to be the theme of the people I've chatted with. Right then, well I'm a good mate who believes friendship is something to cherish. In fact real friendship is bloody marvelous. I'm happy yet sad, you wouldn't know when the sad is about so don't worry if you think I'm a downer as I'm not. Rebel yet mellow, dark with light. I'm 29, athletic, sporting piercings, ink, and the attire ranges. I could be wearing a sport jacket with jeans or cargos, DCs, t and a hoodie (the norm for me). I travel heaps with a broad range of interests as well. As before I listed heaps of them here but now I will only name a few. Hiking, travel, listening to music (everything almost, from jazz and classical to the 70s, 80s and 90s punk. World tunes to electronica, indie, alternative, classic and modern rock etc etc blah blah) and creating it (love mixing eletronica and absolutely hate calling is EDM). I create electronica and love playing me didge, and piano. Vehicle related things as I'm a petrol head, being nostalgic, sitting on roofs, looking for E.T.s, chatting on about space, snow/skateboarding, reading, filming and photographing the world, helping folks and driving around listening to indie and going into your own world. Been a night owl lately so it can be a bit lonely. I'm looking for a good friend, easy as that, proud as punch. Not a friend on short term basis either. A friend for the ages. A GOOD MATE. Can't be to difficult to find that? I dunno perhaps it can.... Age range of friends is a pretty broad one. I know good people that I'm proud as punch to call mates ranging from 18 to 80s. If you're looking for a good friend as well, sit on a roof somewhere and just look at the view, talk and be proper mates, then please, send me a reply. Does not matter if you are tall short square round black white gay straight etc etc etc. Love ya all! I PREFER to chat thru kik, whatsapp, text or actual phone conversation and not so much email.. A few initial emails are OK however it seems that there are way too many flakes and bots thru email. Take care,
Ta!

Any open minded woman/man/couple with an extra or private room to share? If you're not open minded just go on to the next ad. I don't tell you how to live your life please don't tell me how to live mine.

I need a private room or space. 3-4 times a month to bring a friend for play, I'm an older bi male, good shape, easy going. I have a few friends that are good at massage and like to play. I also have done Tantric massage for over 20 years. You can be male or female, couple or T-girl, any age or race. and if you're really open minded you may be able to join us if you like.

I'm looking for an open minded person with extra space and will exchange somehow or is into joining us or can use a bit of extra cash every month. Just a few hours in the afternoon and not more than 2 -3 times a month. Probably just once or twice a month actually. 

To those who will tell me to just ""get a hotel or motel room"" If I could afford that I would do that, duh! Have you checked the prices of hotel or hotel rooms lately? 

I'm looking for someone that has the space, just a private room in a house even. You don't want a full time renter but you either need some repairs or minor work around the house or are horny at times yourself and would like to play also or just would like a little extra cash every month to let us use a room. I can pay up to one hundred dollars a month depending on the room and how available it would be. Needless to say I'm looking for a very clean room, and extra room in your house or even your own bedroom, house or apartment. I did this before and was offered some places I wouldn't let my dog sleep in. 

I'm a non smoker, only rare glass of wine and even rarer 420 friendly. DD free. Very clean easy going, nice responsible older bi man. 

If you don't need the cash but have the space and don't mind my using it we can come to some other barter arrangement. I'm very handy and very open minded. 

If you reply please let me know in the first email where you are located. I'd prefer Valencia, Castaic, Stevenson Ranch or Sylmar area but a little further into the valley may be OK.

Like I said I've done this before so NO one liners, asking me to verify myself or sending me to another email address in your first email. But DO let me know where you are located in the first email. Thanks

Hello. My name is Ralf. I am a Master's (math) degree college student in Denmark and I also do some modeling. This summer (Jun-August) I will be going to Los Angeles under the J-1 visa student/work program. 
I do not have a place to live yet, I am looking to stay near a beach area from Redondo Beach to Malibu, as long as it is near the beach. I can pay you $1,000 a month or $2500 up-front for three months June 1- August 31, 2016. 
I would like a place where I have access to a private room, I can use the kitchen / fridge / etc. 
I am clean, tidy, friendly and respectful. I am quiet and like to read, but I also will be spending plenty of time working and doing minor travel along the California coast.
I would also like you to be similar in manners and also to practice English with me if your time permits.

I hope to hear something from a cool Californian!
Cheers!

Hello
How are we today?
Happy Internation womens day

Well mine is up to a lazy start.

Let's get started before I completely start rambling on,
I am in search for a friend; someone who I can share anything with without judgment and vise-versa. Someone around my age (21-27) since I am 25. Someone just to have fun with and have a great time.
I am a bit of a geek so someone in that human spectrum of geekiness.
I am not looking for a relationship but I am not opposed to a relationship if the chemistry is there; but again mainly looking for a friend and that is the main priority.

A bit about me
Like I said I am 25. I live in Los Angeles (You can ask me where exactly when you answer the post lol). Again I am a bit of a geek and like comics, movies, shows, music, video games. On my free time I love to take pictures of random things, I like to read and play my guitar. Oh almost forgot I love to travel haha seen many places around the world but still have to see much much more. I am a big boy I do have a job.

I will leave it as it is so we can have something to talk about.
I am an opeminded person. When you answer you can ask me anything you would like to know about me and I will most likely respond honestly. By most likely I mean that I won't be giving out ultra super secret information lol

Well that being said If you guys have a kik and decide to answer you guys can reach my kik at jondoe297.
And you guys answer via email please put your favorite character as the subject, a bit about yourself an a picture would hurt. I am not shallow but would like to know who I am talking to. In return to your generosity I will also send a picture.

Haha thank you for your time reading this and hope to hear from you soon.

Things we may have in common, I'm a avid concert goer, love the beach, day or night, I love my dear friend Mary Jane, we have known each other for years lol. I do know how to drink, and I like to. Would be best for both of us if you did too. I'm spontaneous and love a good adventure. I rarely say no lol... ok, I do a lot but not with the cool stuff lol.
I don't know what else to write, this is like dating without the dating part lol. If your looking for a kind of shy, kind of out there girl to hang with then please, say hello. Tell me something about yourself. A pic could be nice to put your words to. To those of you who think we just wouldn't click, good luck on your journey..

I do hope you're drug free, because I don't smoke, nor drink and have far better ""use"" of my time. I would prefer others with stimulating conversation.

I was wondering if there were still persons out there that miss writing to someone. I understand that in today's society time is more valuable. So I won't take up too much of your time, what I am looking for is a woman to write to, get to know. If we have a human connection then we can text and talk on the phone. 

Do you have the imagination and the desire to engage in what may be some of the most interesting and tantalizing conversation you have had in a while? Let's explore the world of words put in such a way that brings images to mind that feel so real, so vivid and floods all your senses. 

I miss having my phone make that beautiful noise of notifying me that I have a message, text or email, how my heart races and my breath quickens in that split second when I look down and see your name, giving me another reason for carrying my phone. 

I don't mind if you're married, in a relationship or single, just have a beautiful personality, great outlook on life and not be hung up on looks or age. I am not here to promise or pretend to be something I'm not, I'm just a man that seeks a connection with a special someone, that's all. I am married, so this would only be for friendship.

I shall do my best to captivate your mind and excite your synapses, igniting a flurry of electrical and chemical sensations within your brain and maybe, just maybe some wonderful memories.

Do you ever find yourself lonely, bored, needing help with starting basic tasks/chores, some simple motivation, assistance with finishing or getting projects started, want someone to watch TV shows with, or accompany you to the movies, go hiking, have breakfast/lunch/dinners with, or simply just being there for you as a friend?

Then look no further, I am that ideal person you have been searching for, here to help you fill the void in your life.

I can be there for you as a friend, listen to your problems, help you shop, style you, give you motivation, assist you with challenging tasks, give you clarity, exercise with you, help you with meals (and dieting), give you advice, help boost your self-esteem, organize your goals and schedules. . .pretty much anything. But most of all, I will be there for you as a friend.

I also specialize in helping people with special issues, such as: addiction (have worked as sober companion), depression, and anxiety.

I have privately helped a roster of clients throughout the years. Ranging from discrete elite, to middle-class individuals - all walks of life. Each person I have worked with has been unique in their own way, but one thing they all had in common was their positive feedback they shared with me, about how I was such a supportive encouragement in their lives. Many have said I helped them survive their darkest times, and have left them with a new outlook on life. Whether it was only a few months or several years, my friendship to them helped encourage them and brought positive change to their lives.

I am a young guy, in my late 20's, living near the West Hollywood area. I have degrees in psychology and counseling, with years of experience working with a wide variety of individuals.
I am very chill/laid-back, easy to talk to, thoughtful, empathetic, compassionate, and considerate person. I take great joy/fulfillment in helping others, by being a genuine friend. I know life is tough, and sometimes it may seem like no one is really there to care or help, but I am. It is my goal to make your life easier, help you smile/laugh, give you entertainment, something to look forward to, but most importantly, to be your friend. I am also great with pets too.

If I sound like someone that could be of help to you, please contact me and we will set up a meeting. My rates are very affordable, but can vary. I typically charge around $25 an hour, but under certain circumstances, adjustments can be made. 

I look forward to helping you!

I am a south bay surfer, who typically is in the ocean early mornings. I will occasionally go after work, pending how the surf is. I am looking for a reliable surfing companion, who wants to join me. Your skill level, looks, race and weight do not matter at all. If you want to learn, I can teach you. If you know how but need some additional pointers, I can help you. I used to be a surf teacher, and I am a really good teacher. If you are a good surfer and just looking for someone reliable then I am your man. 

All I ask if please be drama free, you can pour your heart out to issues you are going through. But do not cause me drama, or be dramatic. There is a big difference from listening to ones issues, and causing issues for that person. So please be drama free, kind hearted reliable and sane that is all that I ask.

Now I am looking for women, because frankly I enjoy female company more them men in the surf. A lot of surfers think they are alpha males when they are as far from Alpha as you can get. And I am there to be in touch with nature and my surroundings. Not to listen to some a wall roid freak ruin the spirits of surfing. So if you are a guy, and know the true meaning of surfing then please feel free to message me. But if you are one of the MANY typical dipshits out in the water, and try and pull any of that crap on me. Be prepared to throw down, because I do not tolerate that crap in the water.

Life feels pretty lonely right now. I'm pretty confused about relationships. I guess you could say I am even pretty confused about life. I would love to have a friend to distract my mind from the past. The ideal situation would be to develop a really cool friendship with you and if we develop a strong bond to evolve into a relationship. I love women. I love being around you, watching your feminine ways, the way you smell, your girlyness, there really isn't anything about a woman that I don't like. 
I guess the only thing I am not attracted to is dishonesty, and unfaithfulness. Of course we don't need to worry about the whole unfaithfulness thing since we are just going to be friends. And I don't mean fuck buddies either. That whole fuck buddy thing is just to modern and liberal for me. 
I am pretty educated, not a genius, and not an idiot. I love to learn new things. I love camping, going bike riding, jogging, going to the beach, writing, listening to music, and talking. Don't worry I also love to listen. It's a beautiful thing when someone opens up to you.
If I sound like someone you would like to be friends with please reach out. Maybe we can make each others lives more complete and fulfilling.

Don't have a man in your life? Of course you don't otherwise you wouldn't be reading this. Tired of spending evenings and the weekends alone while your friends are with their boy friends or husbands? Don't have anyone to spend time with or cuddle up with under a blanket to watch a movie with? Tired of dating players or guys that don't want a relationship? Well maybe we can help each other. 

I am an up front honest guy. Very sincere, very loyal, and very loving. I'm 28. Tall, Dark, Handsome, and Educated. A woman doesn't have to have model looks for me to be attracted to her but she needs to be height/weight proportionate. 

I am a very monogamous man as I typically only even date one woman at a time let alone sleep with more then one woman. I am relationship oriented but am open to being casual. 

I am looking to find a special woman that I connect with on an emotional, intellectual, and physical level. Someone who is highly intelligent, active, and passionate as well as genuine and sincere. Someone who loves to make me feel like a man as much as I love to make her feel like a woman. 
Someone who believes in me, supports me, yet is honest with me because I am not perfect. The woman I find has always been out there, I just haven't been lucky enough to find her yet. Not only will we be passionate lovers and share a deep intimate connection, most importantly we will be best friends. She will be the last thing I see when I go to bed at night and the first thing I see when I wake in the morning. The question is, are you her?

This is not for romance or sex, but for friendship and a companion on rides coming up this spring. Hey--if we hit it off and something ""more"" happens, all the better! But no expectations. Just riding, dining at hidden little roadside cafés, etc.

.
Hi there, So I decided to give craigslist a change and maybe make a new thin
and caring Female friend. I've been shy most of my life. I only have a few
friends in my life and no siblings and no parents either :( . Almost an orphan
just have cousins. I Dont Smoke anything or drink beer so I don't do
bars. I'm just looking for a caring friend to talk with and meet. 

I don't have a car but I have a Bus pass. age is just a number so im looking for friends of any age but with no kids. People say i look like im in my 20's or 30's
Quick facts about me: I live near downtown LA, I'm caring, considerate, thin,
single, I don't have any kids, have helped thousands of people in my life (maybe
Millions), I don't have a car & don't need one, Height is not important or age
but people say I'm tall and in my twenties, I'm not rich but I have a stable
place.
I speak Spanish and English Fluently ... I also teach people different
languages.
Type of friend I'm looking for: Live in the LA area, no kids (not even 1 and
no dogs either), thin, considerate, and really nice
oh and I recently went homeless because my roommate was insane and tried to kill me so I called the cops and she went to jail for a week and I packed my stuff while she was in jail and moved to a downtown shelter. No big deal
Oh I also create Websites for a living.
CALL me.
Music I listen to: Mostly Love Songs, Katy Perry, Blank Space, Mariah Carey
and relaxing music. 
Other of my hobbies and talents: Creating amazing Websites, Doing Special
Effects for photos & movies, Teaching languages, helping the poor and being a
goodie 2 shoes.
If you'd like to talk call me and if we get along we can meet in person. Oh
and don't expect me to tell you where I live unless we become close friends ....
for security reasons.
If you'd like to meet lets talk
I Believe Humans & Living Things have Souls (Spirits are real).

Sincerely,
Some Nice Guy

Hello, I got a great sofa using craigslist so why not someone to just talk to! (preferably skype/kik) anonymous connection, I won't know you from personal details, and back. We can just virtually hang out, tell me about what's bugging you, or I'll talk to you about a very weird movie I've seen, or discuss how good steaks are and how McDonald fries are still the best. Do you like mountain climbing, or racing? I do too, but heights and unmanageable speeds are still scary. 

We can talk about our daily lives, recent problems, achievements, fetishes (can be se.xual), procrastination, and anything. The point of this is just to have someone to listen or talk with because we're all stuck, or are in circles, sleeping under a busy crazy world, or stuck in the endless cycle of the day job, maybe under a busy city that never sleeps or just a lowly countryside. Whichever way, let me know, maybe we can be great anonymous penpals.

My birth year: 1990. Getting out from a conservative Asian background. I feel old... It's like I am stuck, I can't rev up the jeep, and things are in circles. I still have no idea what to do, and I am trying to figure it out, how about you? 

Reply to my add! Time passes, and we all need someone to talk or listen to.

myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.
Jane Fall. Feminism is a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave
their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.
Pat Robertson-right wing Christian evangelist. A woman reading Playboy feels like a Jew reading a
Nazi manual. Gloria Steinem. The more famous and powerful I get, the more power I have to hurt
men. Men use the night to erase us. Stella Adler. We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by
feminists who are anxious to force us to regard the sexes as completely equal in portion and worth.
Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

What's up guys, I'm creating this post in hopes of connecting with some other like-minded individuals (or maybe not, if you want to debate with someone with differing perspectives i'm down) that are interested in general intellectual progressivism, but specifically participate in or are interested in the fields of or related to: Atheism, Anti-Theism, Anarchism, Anarcho-Syndicalism, Altruism/Selflessness, Existentialism, Existential Nihilism, Philosophy, Veganism, Human Rights, Animal Rights, (Actual) Feminism, Pacifism, Ecologism, Anti-Establishment/Corporatism/Capitalism, basic equality, and generally changing the way we see things... 
These are the main causes I can think of off the top of my head, so really people who are open-minded, kind, displeased with popular American/national outlook and sociopolitical norms, displeased with current political state, and interested in seeking truth and the best answers through reasoning and rational thinking.
People with philosophical ideas based in rationale and possibly pursuing writing on these subjects.
People that are focused in socialism, communism, Marxism and other forms of government and economic policy i'd like to talk to too. Especially cool if you have or plan on taking direct action to combat problems.

Not sure if craigslist is really the place to look for people like this lol, but it seems the only other places would be punk concerts and universities, which are both easily hit or miss situations... And vegan restaurants too would work. I guess.
I'm also interested in art: 2d, sculpture, music, film, street art, tagging. My favorite music genres are sludgecore, crust punk, powerviolence, anarcho-punk, doom metal, conscious and hardcore hip-hop, reggae, soul, indie and a lot more, genres related to these I probably like. Pretty depressed music and movies are my favorites: City of God, Gummo, Kids, gang movies. Emotional, meaningful art of all kinds I'd likely enjoy.

As of now I want to establish a base so maybe in the future, friendships, possibly art collectives, housing co-ops, or other stuff can bud from this... I honestly don't know... 
So, if you're interested in any of these things, hit me up at my cell, texting's cool but if you can't I'll probably answer a call. We could talk over text or online or meet in person. I live in the 562 area but I can probably travel. If you email me put CRAIGSLIST in the Subject please, my email is oversaturated with notifications.
show contact info

(I'll link my FB to people interested)
You don't eally have to be into any of these though of you feel we could still be cool. These really just set a preliminary barrier.

If you think any of these things are cool, don't hesitate to hit me up.

Please contact me through this ad and tell me about yourself if you are interested in exchanging email.

Thank you for reading my ad.

So I realize this is kind of an unusual request. I have a curiosity what this world is like. I'm 34 years old, single, professional firefighter. I am friends with and come across many different ""walks of life"" especially in my job. I do not however know anything about the celebrity world. I'm just curious to talk to someone that works in this type of business. Coffee, emailing, texting, a new friendship, I'm open to whatever. I don't even have to know you ID if you feel like just having a anonymous texting friend to converse with. I don't want to use you, I don't want your fame, your money, dirt for TMZ, or use you for my own agenda. I just want to get to know someone in this world that is very different than my own. In return I offer a perspective possibly a little more ""down to earth"" that what you might be used to. I'm very grounded, I have my life pretty well together, and feel like I have a very realistic perspective on the world. I'm just interested in meeting someone different and form interesting conversations out of it. I actually don't even live in the LA area but i visit fairly often if that makes a difference.

I just moved back to the SFV and pretty much all my friends moved away. So I am just looking for some new friends in the area. I'm 24 I like going to edm events concerts maybe get a few drinks I don't smoke but don't mind if you do. I also like going to the movies going for a hike or staying in and getting some redboxes.

If you're reading this, perhaps the nature of the title drew you in. I will be upfront in that I'm not looking for anything other than genuine connection. Why I'm posting here, I can't exactly say. Maybe a bit optimistic? Maybe a bit crazy? Yeah, perhaps just the right amount of both.

I'm in my early 30s, and while I'm generally quite content and satisfied and (insert whatever bullshit positive-sounding adjective you want), I'm very much a restless soul at heart, but I keep that well hidden, I believe. I've had my ups, perhaps more than most, and I've had my downs, and quite frankly, I have no desire to reach out just for the sake of reaching out. I have zero interest in games and fluff. 

The more I type, the less inclined I am to to drone on and on. I feel like if you're even mildly interested to converse further at this point, you'll shoot me an email and we'll go from there. I'm no open book by any means, but what I am is genuine and fully disclosing to those who earn my trust. To get at least the tip of the inevitable superficialities outta the way, yes, I am active and do take care of myself (but yeah, of course the semi-regular porkout happens, more often than I'll admit in such a generic post, ya nosy bastard), so it'll probably be beneficial if you're of a somewhat similar ilk. No, I don't give a rat's ass about your race or age, as far as assigning ""value.""

Hope to hear from you if you're intrigued enough to start meaningful dialogue. Because ultimately, what the hell else is life even about?

Please be comfortable having your photo taken and have an interesting face and /or body. All ages, ethnicities welcome - Latino, Armenian, white, black, Asian, etc. If you are photogenic that would be a plus! If you have a backstory (actor, athlete, uniform, etc.). that could be incorporated into the portrait, that would be even better. 

What's in it for you? I will trade photo files for your time. If you are an actor or model who wants to add to your portfolio, I'm happy to give you any photos you like. I can also spring for a coffee or two, but that's about it right now!

If you are interested, hit me up with any questions you might have. The next step would be to set up a meeting (at Starbucks, etc.) to chat and see if it will work for both of us.

Are you awakening?
Do you know the true history of Earth and its ancestors?
Your past lives?
The truth about Buddha and Jesus?
Interplanetary civilizations?
Who is running your planet?

I have many answers. My whole life has been observing and studying life.
Studying history.
Studying the unknown.
Coming across people with knowledge that were meant to cross my path.

Someone is always there to shoot down knowledge by saying only god knows.
Let me tell you that many know.
Many more are knowing.

For those who truly search and hunger for knowledge,
I can assure you that you will find it. Because knowledge want s to be found.
Knowledge is dying to be found.

I am light years ahead, i have put missing pieces to the master piece others are still searching for.

I am not a guru or shaman.
Not a prophet.
I am a regular man who has proven anyone can know the unknown.

""One does not need to search for enlightment,
One simply has to know he already is."" 
Mars

You are a point of view of supreme consciousness.
We are all different points of view of Supreme consciousness.
We are all the same Supreme consciousness in our original state of being.

I have written and discussed material on:

Death is an illusion
The Trinity
Dreams
Magic
Annunaki and the Summerians
How to defeat the Global elites
Truth about Dinosaurs
The subconscious mind
The time track of a spiritual being
Past lives
Architects of religion on Earth
Creation of homosapiens in Earth
Ufo,s
Nazis on the moon
Our history on Mars
The galactic confederation

My friends now are urging me to teach.
To make an income that would allow me to take time off from Carpentry to awaken others.

An old man once approched me and prophesized that i would sacrifice my own personal love for love of mankind.
Maybe this is part of it.

I'm looking to charge an affordable fee for a session to see if it's something you'd be interested in.

I'm looking to build a clientele of people i can share knowledge and one on one phone coaching. I can cover anything one desires to talk about.

I will teach you a simple technique that will help to let you know if you are making the right decision on anything.

I'm hoping to hear from you....
Even if you have questions that i can answer through email for you.
Can be about anything. I will show you i mean business.

Thanks for your time....

We are a monogamous gay couple in our fifties that have been happily together for many years. We are looking to meet other gay couples that are interested in developing a platonic (non-sexual) friendship, based on our common interests. We enjoy conversation and just hanging out, dining out (our favorites are Indian, Italian, Persian, Mexican, Middle-Eastern, Thai, and Chinese food), board games, amusement parks, some hiking, the occasional night out dancing, movies, science fiction, fantasy, comics, and trips up the beautiful California coast. We are clean, polite, caring, non-pretentious, easy going, and have a sense of humor . We are looking for the same. We don't smoke or use drugs, and prefer the same, so if you or you partner light up frequently, we are probably not a good match. And even though we both love animals, one of us is allergic to cats, so no cats please. So, if you are a gay couple and are looking to meet some new friends for the New Year, please contact us!

Shoot me an email if this is something that interests you. I am not picky on age but I prefer to stay below 35. I am just looking for friendship and nothing more than that.

As I get older (42), it can be harder to feel attractive and wanted. I work out very hard to maintain my shape and would love to have someone to simply talk to that understands how it feels to be in this situation. However, because I'm in a relationship, there might not be times I can answer. 

I'm attractive, confident, I'm in great shape/athletic, I'm outgoing, I can carry a conversation/make people laugh, be the life of a party, considerate to others, I dress well, and have a good job.

There's just that part in my life that doesn't feel I get the attention I deserve for my hard efforts. Does this sound like you at times? Do you need to vent? Express how it feels? Perhaps even seek motivation to keep in shape?

Hi,

I am a single mom and I have two kids that are 19 and 15, both of whom live at home with me full time. We love to go out and do things as a family, in the past my sister lived nearby, or we had another family or close friends around and we loved getting together with them and hanging out, however many of our friends have moved away and we get tired of looking at only each other. LOL

Some things we might like to do, go on a camping trip (we are seasoned campers and hikers). OR go to a ball game, or hang out at the beach. We might like to go bowling, play paintball or go mini-golfing. We might like to do a movie night, or a game night. How about a BBQ or pizza night. A game of Crazy Eights? Maybe we could go to the archery range. We even like the zoo, museums and other educational things. Sometimes we like to go to yard sales and farmer's markets. Last Friday night we went to watch the filming of America's Got Talent. (well we did that with friends, but still you could have come)

I think you get the idea. This would be for friends. I would like to meet you (the adult) first and see if we think hanging out with the kiddos would be fun and go from there. 

We do not care about race, or what not. We are looking for people like us that want more friends and love having little adventures. If you have teenagers, great, but open to any age.

Looking for a girl to talk with and share experiences. Just recently got out of a 4 year relationship that's left me a little emotionally scarred, hoping to find someone who can help me forget, who can tell me they have felt a similar pain, who can say to me ""Let's start over."" As far as I know we're each only given one chance to be human and experience all it has to offer, Sorrow is one experience I now know but I don't want to waste all my time on that. 
I want have that feeling of being connected to another human being again. I won't lie I am in my own way a dark deviant yet there was some one who fell in love with that part of me so perhaps...maybe... 
Hope to hear from 'you' whoever you maybe be no matter how flawed.


p.s. I am not looking for anything sexual, I'm a broken person who's capable of fucking someone I'm actually in love with.

Facials would be awesome too. My work is done well. Spoil yourself with steam facials, stunning eyelash extensions, body scrubs, waxing & my signature head to toe massages.

I used to make a living as a massage therapist, and after being single for a while, I find myself wanting to return to the sensual massage with a beautiful woman like I used to give a girlfriend. I'm still as skilled as ever, and promise to give you a great, therapeutic massage. I have a massage table, oil, candles, and everything to make it perfect.

I can also assure you that you will love the sensual touch I will bring to it. Your comfort is most important to me, so you set the limits. To give you an idea of the sensual massage, I will touch you in a way that will excite you to no end, and bring you to climax in whatever way you would like. If you're comfortable with it, I will be nude during the massage, and I welcome you to touch me anywhere you like. Another promise I can make is that you will be very happy to find how well endowed I am. 

I am not asking for a fee for my massage. The pleasure we both will get is more than enough.

About me - I'm white, tall, thin, clean cut, attractive, intelligent, and very kind. I'm happy to send pictures if you are.

Hope to hear from you soon.

I am a musician, American born and raised with strong roots, latin male. I play guitar professionally, all styles (mostly metal and indie rock). Music is my life so If you are into the music scene or you just like to go to clubs to see live music that's a big plus. This ad is for friendship and fun. I am Spanish with some Italian and was born and raised here in California!

I'm late 40's, have S&P long rocker hair, metal style and a crazy metal beard, but can switch looks and style for any occasion, easy on the eyes. Many of my friends are in their 20's, so if you're young we can still kick it, because I'm not some creep, I'm just older. I play guitar and produce music. I haven't subscribed to the whole ""act your age"" thing. Music scene and performing keep me young. I play metal and progressive rock so if you are into metal and or good classic rock that would be awesome! Concerts!

THIS IS ALL ABOUT FUN!! LET'S HAVE SOME! There's enough boring people around. 

Anyways, I like to kick it with white girls. I like to go to live music shows, and sometimes just want a nice white woman to accompany me. This is platonic, but who knows, maybe more if chemistry is right. FWB? Maybe just good friends, either way I respect boundaries, and I keep it real. I'm not some hard up lamer. That's why I posted here in the platonic section. But if we are attracted to each other there's nothing wrong with that. I'm open for romance also, haha, yeah right, like that's going to happen at my age! :(

I like fair skin and smart conversation. You are an open minded woman who isn't hung up on race, or the role that your peers expect you to fulfill. You like attention, and draw peoples eyes when you go out. You have cool style and are clean person. You like to drink and have an occasional smoke. You have your life together and get bored sometimes when there's no one around. Hit me up! If you are really light skinned redhead I will flip out, I love redhead girls!

Send me an email telling me about yourself and your interests and style. I am genuinely interested in you, and like to make eye contact when we talk. 

Let's go see some live music or hit a movie or art exhibit or grab some food. I especially like the beach at night. We can even grab some beers and hang out at my place which is nice and has amazing views of the city! I'll play you some guitar. If you sing thats awesome.

Looking forward to hearing from you!!

My girlfriend feels I should come up with a list of things or ideas that can help me show my true devotion to her. I am open to chatting with any females who might have some insight, suggestions, ideas, etc for me to discuss over email.

Thank you

Hi! :)

I'm a nice low-key guy and I have training as a counselor in several modalities. Currently, I counsel people very part-time as a hobby, totally free, just because I like to help people. I've had very good results. People feel much better, situations get better.

I'm not trying to sell anything, or push any particular ideas or viewpoints. Just here to help. I'm kind, considerate, non-judgemental, a great listener, friendly and funny. I work with people over the phone.

Feel free to contact me if you want to. Maybe I can help.

The complete historical subjugation of women to men must be rated as one of the most fantastic myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.
Jane Fall. Feminism is a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave
their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.
Pat Robertson-right wing Christian evangelist. A woman reading Playboy feels like a Jew reading a
Nazi manual. Gloria Steinem. The more famous and powerful I get, the more power I have to hurt
men. Men use the night to erase us. Stella Adler. We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by
feminists who are anxious to force us to regard the sexes as completely equal in portion and worth.
Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

I'm drinking hot tea... I've just burnt my tongue, yet again because I'm too impatient to wait for it to cool a bit...my hair is very seldom perfectly coiffed as it is curly and it has a mind of its own, but no matter. I don't know all things, but I'd like to. I awant to speak about nothing, anything, all things. I tend to be awkward if I find you attractive. I'm that girl that laughs at your silly jokes, not because you're particularly funny, but because I like it when you smile. I think people should always say what they mean, instead of when they think you want most to hear. I prefer SmartWater over Fiji, but coconut water is my favorite if it's available. I sing along to Frank & Dean and wink whenever they've sang something clever and charming.

Hello, just wanted to try this out first. We are a married gay couple in our 40's (mix racial-glk White & Asian). We're interested in adopting and raising a child - I always dreamt of having a family and raising a child. I think this would be an opportunity for someone out there who can help us, help you, who can't keep their child. We live in a 2bd/2bth house with large yard space in Central LA.

Hi. Please read all of this ad before replying. I know this is an unusual ad. I'm a lesbian woman seeking friends. But I'm looking for others who have had LASIK or other similar types of eye surgeries. I have had both LASIK and PRK. My life went downhill since I had the surgeries many years ago. I find that I connect more with people who've had similar eye surgeries, so that's why I'm looking for this specific thing. You don't have to be someone who is unhappy with your LASIK results. I just find that I connect better with people who've had these eye procedures. Due to my eye issues, I don't drive. So I'd like to find someone who I can hang out with, go places with on the bus or Metrolink, like trying different restaurants, museums, amusement parks, gay bars. I live on my own and would also be nice to have a friend who could sometimes help when I have something heavy to lift at home. Although that doesn't happen too often.
A little about myself: I'm in my early 40s. I am more butch looking. I have short hair. I don't dye my hair or wear much make-up. I am half Mexican. I suffered some minor burns to the skin on my face a few years ago. But I don't look like I was burned, I just look like I""m a little older than my age. I mention this cause I'm insecure about it. I'm more of a shy person. I usually let the other person do most of the talking. I grew up attending religious private schools in the San Gabriel Valley. I love animals. I like to collect movies on VHS tape. I am very liberal in terms of my political views. I rarely drink and I don't smoke. It's OK if you drink or smoke, as long as you don't smoke around me.
What I'm looking for is a friend who is preferably between the ages of 37 and 47. Someone who is kind and non-judgmental. I don't like people who cuss a lot or people who are violent. You would have to be a guy who is OK with us just being friends, being I am gay. (To any perverts, please don't think that I will be into doing a threesome with you and another woman. I won't do that.) If you'd like to go with me to a gay bar that would be cool. That would be cool if you were also gay, but that's not a requirement. 
If you'd like to respond, please email me and I'll get back to you soon. Thanks!

so the honest truth to begin this ad with is that I am married. I am NOT unhappily married nor is my marriage in any way difficult. I'm just looking for something more. I guess you can say I want something exciting and the idea of an affair has always excited me. In the end I think it's in our human nature to always want more than what we have. Or in other words sometimes we are just selfish. 

I would enjoy having an affair with a woman who maybe finds herself in the same situation as I do or someone who just find the idea of being with a married man exciting. As far as age is concerned I would prefer someone between the ages of 20 thru 32. anyway hope to hear from you.

So I thought I found the perfect MT, but I was wrong. 15 minutes into the massage, he started saying inappropriate things and asked if I wanted a sensual touch. Um, No and Fuck you! Do, let's try this again. 

PLEASE READ THE ADD AlL THE WAY THROUGH, BEFORE RESPONDING!!

I am a massage therapist who is in need of a good massage. I've been lifting heavier than usual and could use a good combo sports/deep tissue massage. I usually trade with my friends who are also therapist, but no one is available. Since this is strictly platonic, I don't care about your gender, if you're single, how often you workout or looks. All I care about is whether or not you are a Lmt or cmt and are knowledgeable about the human anatomy. You must be able to perform deep tissue and sports massage.
If you live in Woodland hills, that would be perfect! I'm looking for someone local.
This is STRICTLY PLATONIC! 
I have my own table and supplies. You can come to me or I to you. either way works for me. Once again, this is STRICTLY PLATONIC!! Race, sex, height and looks are of no importance to me.

I'm seeking a long-term email penpal with whom I can exchange at least one long email with once a day, sharing our innermost thoughts, feelings, ambitions, and desires. Sometimes we just need to talk and we have no one to talk to- well, let's be that person for each other. Everybody's lives are so unique and complicated and distinctly important to them- let's appreciate the lives of others, and entangle our lives together by the simple, therapeutic act of writing to each other. About me: I'm a college student studying in a science-related field who's suffered from social anxiety and depression on and off. Sometimes I find myself (like now) studying late at night, or early in the morning, and feeling really alone in this huge world. Each day is different, yet the same- I only feel truly happy when I notice life's simple and beautiful things, like a little hummingbird flying out of the lush green bushes or the deafening roar of thunder in the rare storm. Maybe our correspondence can be, in a sense, one of those simple and beautiful things.

Hello, I am a tall (6'1), athletic/fit, attractive Korean male, used to model for a minor asian agency. 
I am well educated (UC alumni; currently medical school), down-to-earth, funny and respectful.

Hi how are all of you?
I hate going to the movies by myself. It sucks, and I really love the movies, so without anyone to talk to movies about, I find myself rather lonely and not enjoying them so much.
Okay, that was kind of depressing, so let me start over.
I am looking to just hang out as friends with a nice Asian girl and who would not mind to go see the movie Olympus Has Fallen with me. I know, it's a mindless man movie, but sometimes you just need to watch something that has zero importance and forget about reality for awhile. So if you would be interested in this, let me know and we can set it up for this week. Monday would be nice perhaps?
Oh, why Asian, you ask? No, I don't have yellow fever or a weird Asian fetish (gross to both those things!). I lived and worked in Asia for several years and most of my friends are Asian, so it's just a comfort thing for me at this point. Just am more in tune with Asian culture than others and I'd like to keep it that way. Make sense? I hope so. 

About me: Blond hair, blue eyes, I hope you won't think I'm ugly. I'm in my early 30's, college educated, run several businesses, and am an author and app maker. I do a LOT of different things in my life. When we get together, I don't care if you are married, dating, single, or whatever, because this honestly is just about friendship. I mean, sure, it would be nice to meet somebody, start off platonic, and be more later down the road, but that's so far removed from my thinking for a million reasons that you honestly have nothing to worry about with me. I'm just looking for great company.

So if you want an easygoing, polite and respectful white guy to go watch a silly movie with, message me and tell me about yourself. Maybe send a pic but it's not necessary because this isn't about how you look. I'm 5'7, so maybe if you are 6'2 that would matter, because then it would look like I'm your kid or something lol. But if you are Asian, you probably are either my size or more likely, shorter, so I guess that won't be a problem to be scene in public with each other in that regard. Not that I even care I guess, but you might?

Sorry, tangent. So yeah, message me and we'll go from there. If you are particularly awesome when we meet, the movie is my treat. And we should definitely get together before the movie to just break the ice and sit someplace and talk. Sound good? Hope to hear from somebody tonight or tomorrow!

I'm seeking to find someone who'd be comfortable posing nude. I'd like to shoot a series of nudes inspired by a few greats in photography, Richard avedon and Helmut Newton. These are two of my favorite photographers with a very unique and well known style, and produced a strong series of work during the late 80s. I'm open to body types, and am willing to photograph no face if you prefer only having your body showing. Please contact me if you're interested or have any questions.

Hi CL!

After surfing this casual encounter section for the past few weeks now, I've decided to finally post!

To start off, I've noticed that there are a lot of ""bots"" and ""spammers"" on this website, so I'd like to let you know that I'm completely real. It's a Thursday, March 3rd, and I'm looking to meet up this weekend, preferably Saturday night.

About me -- I'm 21 years old, and currently a senior at one of the universities in Los Angeles. I was born and raised near San Gabriel, and grew up here in the city. I'm educated, smart, well-dressed, confident but not cocky, and funny. I love watching movies and TV shows, to playing video games, to reading books, to finding the best places to eat. 

While I'm looking for a FWB, I'd love to also find someone that I don't mind ""grabbing a beer with."" I'm 100% not looking for a relationship, but I would prefer that we get along intellectually and that we're able to have a conversation. I'm looking for someone who's not afraid of the ""friend"" in FWB, someone who's down to watch a movie or grab a cup of coffee on any given day.

Sexually, I'm pretty inexperienced. To be upfront, I've been with two people in my 21 years of life. I do prefer giving more than receiving, but that might be because I've never really experienced a great blowjob? Nonetheless, I love being between a girl's legs. Giving someone pleasure is definitely more fun than being on the receiving end.

Physically, I'm Asian, ~5'8, and athletic. From years of swimming, I've gained broad shoulders. I love to stay physically fit, and I do work out around 4 times per week. I don't smoke or do any drugs, drink recreationally, and have no weird piercings or tattoos. 

Ideally, you are older than 18 and fun to be around! I love people who are humorous and know how and when to crack a great joke. I'm attracted to women who are smart and confident, a la ""lady in the street but a freak in the bed."" I'm open to any race and any race. Please practice safe sex, and be disease free! 

Kink wise, I'm still pretty new to everything. I've mostly experienced ""vanilla"" sex, so I'm open to trying out new kinks. We can talk about this! :)

If you fit the above, I'd love to hear from you! Send me a message that describes who you are and what you're looking for. Want a quicker reply? Send me a photo!

Thanks for reading and I hope to hear from you soon :)

Verify: It's Jan 2016!

Thanks for clicking on my post! I hope I'm what you're looking for!

I'm currently looking for a 100% no-strings-attached relationship with an older Asian woman, preferably over the age of 30. I find older women attractive not because of the cub / cougar fantasy, but because of the experience that older women have. It turns me on to meet a woman who knows what they want, how they want it, and won't confuse or mistake sex with a relationship.

I'm currently 21 years old and a business student at USC. I'm Asian (born and raised in LA), roughly 5'7 - 5'8, and fit. Been going to the gym 5-6 times per week, so I'd consider myself in pretty good shape! I also don't smoke anything (but am 420 friendly). I'm passionate about life, and love to approach things one step at a time. I have interests in all sorts of things from superhero movies, sports, food, and more. I think my best trait is that I'm very easy to get along with, and I guarantee you that I'll be able to make you laugh with my humor :)

Once again, I'm seeking a 100% NSA, discreet relationship with an older woman. I'd love to be your boy toy, one that you can call and I'll come to respond to any of your needs right away (granted it doesn't conflict with classes, etc.) Sex-wise, I wouldn't say I'm the most experienced -- been only with 2 people -- so I'm hoping to learn different techniques and explore some fantasies with you.

My only requirement is that you're easy-going (and clean/DDF of course)! This will be a completely discreet relationship, so I don't care if you're attached or married, etc. I'd prefer you to be easy-going, as I'd love to have a FWB relationship with a person that I actually get along with away from sex. It'll be great to sometimes meet up just to talk over a cup of coffee!

If what I'm offering sounds of interest to you, please don't hesitate to reach out! To weed out the spam, please put your city on the email subject line. And then tell me more about yourself! What are you looking for, etc. Plus.. a picture of yourself is greatly appreciated! (It'll let me know you're real)

Hi!

It's Feb 2016.

I'm a 21 year old Asian male who's always been attracted to older women. I find the age gap insanely hot, and the years of experience a huge turn on. To be upfront, while I'm not super ""experienced"" (only 2 other partners), I have been with an older woman before when I was 18 and she was 30. Had a really fun time, and looking to recreate that experience again!

I'm ~5'8, 145 lbs, with a fit/athletic build. I used to swim heavily, and love working out every week. I'm currently a college student, do not have any tattoos / piercings, and am DDF free.

Please be clean and FUN! :)

body : athletic

age: 33

I am truly addicted to inhaling the sharp pungent vinegary scent of an attractive woman's sweaty dirty stinky pantyhose feet soles and toes. I have a passion for women's feet after they have been on their feet all day and they need to be rubbed and adored i like all types of women's feet young,mature,bbw's, if you are shy about sharing your feet with me when they are smelly and stinky then this is not for you, im looking for open, confident women that are open to let me rub their smelly feet after a long day of work on their feet and give them the attention the need, i want to enjoy that feminine erotic scent that your feet creates over the day that is an Aphrodisiac :) I want to feel your warm foot in my hands as I help you escape from your heels. I want to touch and rub your foot and bring your toes to my nose and inhale the sensual feminine scent contained within your feet I imagine being at your feet while I massage and worship your feet at the end of a long day. Allowing me the privilege of unwrapping your feet from your heels is a treat and honor that I will not take lightly. I'll kiss, lick, suck and worship your feet to show you how much I appreciate you sharing your feet with me. some pics of the types of women's feet i like. and specially i love bbw's and mature cougars i love their maturity. and i love the calluses on a mature womens feet :)

contact me with your age, location and a picture

thank you

I like women's feet that work this jobs wearing ballet flat, pump heels, strappy leather sandals and more.

You've got questions.

Serious questions.

SUPER serious questions.

""What happened to a sense of wonder?""

""How do I rectify the natural human urge to make the world a better place with the reality of ultimately meaningless natural human obsessions?""

""What do I do when I realize being a grown up kind of sucks?""

""Where does this ennui come from?""

""Why is ennui such a funny word? It sounds like what a toddler would call his penis, an in-wee""

""Oh shit. Please stop thinking about that. The private parts of toddlers is never something that should be thought about, unless you're a pediatric urologist ""

""Is pediatric urology a real field? Or are they just pediatricians or urologists?""

Yes, we all have questions. Just hopefully not about pediatric urology.

I know this is a long shot, but honest abe didn't succeed in his first shot either.

I met this girl via craigslist. she had replied to a posting I had posted in casual encounters about me performing oral sex on her. We exchanged pictures, and sort of hit it off. We didn't end up meeting, but we talked, texted, and made intentions of being friends...Turned out she was a very outdoorsy kind of girl...like literally hiking everyday... as couple days transpired, she always talked about us getting together, hanging out, going hiking, and doing things together. However, ""things"" kept coming up, and she kind of ended up just blowing me off and shooting down the plans we would make.... It got to the point where she just ghosted me completely. This happened a couple of weeks ago... but I just haven't been able to shake this from my psyche.

It's not the fact we didn't hook up, but she projected herself as this sweet person, to only act and behave counterpoint to what she was portraying...I think that bothered me the most.

This weird experience created a couple of desires and unfulfilled wants in my mind. Where I am hoping that maybe...just maybe there is somebody out there...

That already goes hiking, or wants to --- but doesn't have a buddy to go hiking with --- or that their hiking buddy no longer really goes hiking with them. If we hit it off, I would be open to a more deeper and intimate connection.... if it doesn't pan out, at least we tried.

I would also like this moment to disclose that I am physically handicapped as well. As circumstances would have it, i was born without an arm, and leg, but I don't let that impair my mobility and enthusiasm for being an active person. I write this tidbit, so if you do decide to reply, you know about this going in, and aren't surprised later and feel I might have deceived you or this isn't what you wanted.

about me: fairly well educated, masculine guy, hairy with facial hair that i keep groomed/trimmed. deep voice, i'm about 6'1 feet tall and about 180 pounds. I enjoy a fine craft beer from time to time. 4:20 friendly, but its not a compulsory must...i don't want it to be the focal point of this post. No drugs, no stds, clean bill of health. Currently I am single, dating, but haven't quite met someone I can synergyze well with.

If you are seriously interested, please reply with your picture, age, location. A number would speed up this process and weed out the people that aren't serious.

lets give it a shot.

Hello, nothing new here...just looking for a friend that is looking for one as well:) i will make this simple..

-im looking for someone to chat with and possibly hang out with. Its been a while since i had a steady and long term email buddy, and its about time to find someone now. Talk about everything and anything. More than how was our day and more into what we enjoy about each other. 

-about me: i have light skin, short black hair, tall, thin but muscular, smart, enjoys walks, going to theme parks, laying on the beach, watching action movies, and playing some games (xbox360). 

-im looking for any girl that is young or older. Asian, white or Hispanic is prefered but im open. Im looking for a long term friendship than just a 'hi and bye' thing. long term meaning either a few months or a few years...just see where it goes and how we get along:) You can be married, divorced, kids, no kids, single, deaf and want to have someone to talk with or whatever else there is...as long as your fun to talk with and enjoy a good conversation without taking anything too personal if our conversations become personal.

I dont take things too personal, nor do i get mad easy. I worked at different places where it was a direct people contact where people tell me off or tell me hows my day, so im pretty calm about everything and keep cool under pressure haha

i hope this gets to the right person. I will definitely give you my photo once we get acquainted:)

-Enjoy your night/day and i hope to talk to someone soon:)

Looking for someone who would enjoy developing a friendship over companionship for active athletic activities - its more fun when you mix it up and have someone that's passionate about similar activities. 
Ideally you're single but if not, that's cool, as i'm looking for someone with similar interest that don't mind the early runs to Bally, Inspiration Point, etc, or riding on the strand, or riding to breakfast on the weekends. Be nice if you're also decent conversationalist. I thank you for all interest in advance, but likely will filter based on response's to my questions

Email - with subject line ""habpy"" - Also, will be nice to know some personal details & have a pic b4 meeting ! And where your typical weekend hikes are (the more specific your answer is the better), and your typical biking routes are. Also, where you're located (this will have the most impact as I would much rather carpool if at all possible for hikes). ..

Hello, im looking for a online chatting buddy. Im 28 years old. Im looking for a friend to chat online and get to know each other. Im not sure about meeting in person because i had some bad encounters when it came to face to face meetings and hanging out...like someone holding a knife in front of me and waving it and asking 'whats wrong?' lol...

-So i will just make this ad simple. Im looking for a friend that would like to chat online about things we wouldnt normally talk to other people about, talk about our day, and other subjects. I do not care how old you are, but as long as you are understanding, do not taking everything personal, speak your mind, fun, friendly and just yourself. All that is basically what i am. 

-i dont feel i belong to a race, but i just belong to myself. I just do my own thing and say what i want to say. I like to go to theme parks, take walks in parks, visit museums, see friends (which i should have today), play games, and go to the beach and enjoy the ocean and the bright sun when i have time.

-Im looking for anyone that would like to chat for the long term. I dont like those short term things..but someone that would like to build a true friendship or something more online and maybe if we meet in person. I dont care about your age. I am into nerdy girls and older Asian women:) but im also into someone that is mature but fun to be around.

-I will send my pic but when we get to know each other. Im 5ft 10 inches. short black hair, thin but muscular, eat a lot of food but never gains weight, light skin, and thinks about the future more than what im going to do the next day.

-I hope to talk to someone very soon. i dont care if your too young or older, just be yourself and not immature. 

-i have more to talk about..but i will wait to hear from you..have a nice day:)

Hello, 
I'm a tall, muscular, dominant / aggressive bear type of cuddler. I have a four pack, and am a really nice person. I'm seeking someone that wants to share a very romantic moment with me. I'm the type of person that likes to touch, feel, and kiss slowly. I enjoy taking my time with partner, and actually opening up the opportunity to get intimate with her. I'm not the type of person that rushes into sex, I'm the type of person that loves taking his time. I'm looking for someone interested in cuddling for long periods of time near a fire-pit under the stars, or on a cold summer night in the sheets. Truly it doesn't have to be sex, I simply want to show someone absolute affection through cuddling, and touching. 
I'm the type of person that'll offer a soft kiss from your lips, to your ears, down your neck, and to your shoulder. My arms would be wrapped around my fragile partner and I'd pull her in so that she knows she's safe. (I have big arms). I've always wanted to take it a step further and bring out the candles, yet I've never had the opportunity to do so. 
If anyone is interested in cuddling, kissing, and being shown that absolute affection, please send me an email. I'm a young guy, not one of those creepy 50 year old men on CL. I'm also well aware that it's seldom to find people like me, because I enjoy taking my time. To me it's not just about the sex, It's more of an intimate role that I enjoy having. 
Feel free to email me. 
Your picture in exchange for mine. :) (I will send it after you send me yours) 
Ps I'm 23

Hi there. Ok, I have a pretty unique proposal for someone who is going!

I'm going to the event and am wondering if I could make a new friend (or friends) to go with, since I'm not going with anyone. I'm flying in from out of state and am also looking for a place to crash while I'm in town, so I figured that staying with someone who's already going might be the perfect solution.

So if you are going to EOL and can offer me a place to stay for those 2-3 nights, I would be so thankful. I'm also a life & business coach, so in exchange for helping me out I will gladly offer you at least a couple of sessions for free, which we could do on the phone beforehand, or whenever is convenient. I have helped people with anything you can imagine. I basically hold a space of possibilities, ask insightful questions, and help people feel more empowered in any area of life that they need assistance with. One of my areas of specialty is emotional processing, but I do a lot of things. And I can link you to my site and testimonials so that you can see I'm legit.

OR... if you're not going to the event but are within walking distance of the Alex Theater in Glendale, we could do the same thing - free coaching / crashing.

Hey, I'm currently 29 years old. First time seeking attention on Craigslist. Seems weird. But my younger friends says it's normal. They suggested dating web sites. But I'm not quite sure I'm looking for a date. I'm a full time mother so there is so time for dating. So just end up looking like a flake. So figured maybe someone would like to be friends and get to know one another. 
I love music, I'm kinda of a movie geek. I love art. My dream is to get into special effects make-up and or professional cosplay make-up artist. 
I pay attention to details too much sometimes, some say. I think it's a good thing. A lot say I have a Big Feisty personality for such a lil momma. It can be a turn off. and it can be a turn on. Most of my friends I've had for years cause well, they known me, they're like ""FUCKIN MJ"" .. anyways many new acquaintances don't have patience or open mind to my humor or views... Speaking of views. I am a mom and I am an adult that is prescribed to medical marijuana for almost ten years before it was ""COOL"". But like I said, I am an adult know when and where. I mostly bake brownies. Plus I get my chocolate fix too. It's easier to kills two birds with one stone once a month. ;-)
So If you wanna talk to someone cool, shoot the shit, a fellow: mother, movie,music,dance,cosplay,art, or you just wanna regualur old school pin pale to BS with. HIT ME UP. :-)

This is strictly for free. I'm a pretty good photographer but want to use my camera more often for experience. You will have to host or in a reasonably close outdoor area. I use natural light indoors or out. I do have a light setup and even green screen but am not going to haul my equipment all over for a first shoot setup unless I get to know you. I'll take candid shots or posed, fully clothed, boudoir or nude. Straight or kink (exceptions are animals, blood, scat or under age) I'm an older bi male, a bit kinky so am open to any kind of pictures you want or need. From straight face shots for portfolios to your own nudes or a bit kinky bi or hetro poses with a friend, wife or girlfriend.

You keep all pics except for any you allow me to add to my portfolio to show what I can do. I'm also very good with video if you have your own camera and need personal video. And I do have editing programs, both pictures and video.

I only have time afternoons or early evenings during the week and it must be at your place or reasonably close outdoor area.

IN YOUR FIRST EMAIL, tell me what type of photos you want, where you are located and if you have the time... ONLY afternoon or early evenings during he week. I don't mind spending a few hours shooting if needed.

Any hint of spam goes right into trash I don't want to waste my time or yours.

I'm looking to practice hypnotising others and need a few guinea pigs that are genuinely willing to explore something unique and fun. Have you been hypnotized before, or admired as someone else went under? Maybe you've seen a stage show demonstration?

I have some hypnosis techniques that I'd like to refine. We'd start with an online hypnosis induction through a video I've created. So you'd start privately at home.

If you're interested, please meet the following criteria:

Age 18-28, gender or sexual preference is unimportant, windows computer with stereo headphones (speakers won't cut it), and an ability to focus well, and above all that you're genuinely interested in hypnosis and not a skeptic.

At some point, if we both agree, will progress to meeting 1:1 for in-person experiments, but initially experimenting online first.

Tell me your age (real age please), gender, whether you've been hypnotized or caught sleepwalking before, and have an open mind. Put ""Hypnotize me!"" in your subject line so I know you can follow English written instructions.

I'll run this ad for a while since I'm looking for several guinea pigs. Thanks in advance!

얘들 아, 그냥 한인 타운에 이동과 어울리고 한국있는 지역에서 사람을 찾고. 나는 현재 문화 센터에서 한국어를 공부뿐만 아니라 개인 한국어 코치를보고하지만 난 한국인 (여기가 이야기하고 내 한국어 연습을 그들과 함께 상호 작용)의 주위에 사회적으로해야하고 경우에 나를 위해 쉬울 것 같은 느낌입니다 나는 함께이 물건을 할뿐만 아니라 진정으로 의미있는 결합을 구축 한국 친구가 있었다. 나는 연말에 6 월 / 월에 한국으로 이동 계획, 나는 방문 한 달 동안 한국에 갈 계획입니다.

당신이 케이팝, kdrama, 일반 영화와 한국 문화에 관련된 모든 일을 좋아한다면, 만나서 좋은 친구가 될 수 있습니다.

Hello CL goers =)
I'm in the market for a new friend and understand this is strictly platonic, so I'm not looking for anything beyond friendship really.

That being said, I'd like to meet someone new to just hang out with occasionally and have a fun day or a good conversation. Although I do not part take, I am indeed 420 friendly and I do like a good drink or two every now and then.

About me
I'm a really calm kind of guy. I despise problems and drama to the max. I like to laugh and keep my company laughing too. I'm into working out and staying semi healthy, every now and then I just have to have some sort of unhealthy asian food hahah

I'd like to be able to consult with you on subject's such as style/fashion, food, and possibly romance maybe return said consultation when and if requested. I wouldn't mind being a work out buddy at all or even just the guy you can bring to a party a trust you'll be safe, normal friend stuff ^.^

I just have to say this one more time because people on this site both male and female seem to not understand what ""Strictly platonic"" means; Just friends easily put. I'm only looking for a friend.

Well if I seem like Someone you wouldn't mind chilling with from time to time just drop a message in my online mail box and I'll get back to you post haste ^.^ I have pictures if you want to see me before we talk and I'll answer any questions you may have, I'm an open book.

Hope to hear from you soon.

I am looking for new friends. People who understand you do not have to spend cash to have a good time. Artistic creative people. 

If you are the type of person who wants to play a game of checkers and say we can't because we don't have a board. Get out of here. That attitude is pee-pee. You should respond. Lets grab some rocks and etch a checkerboard into the ground and play. That is how it is done. lol

I am not necessarily looking to date. I want friends and if things go from there that is chill as well.

So if you are down to meet up, chill, and draw some chalk. Hit me up.
If you want to know who I am ask. I'll send you a link to everything you would need to know.


In Addition: 
- Sending a picture gets you brownie points and I will send one back. 
- It helps if you live close by. It is not an issue tho esp if you travel. lol
- Helps a lot if you are single and without children.
- I will not download any special communication apps or programs.

Let's see. I'm looking for a woman who is looking for an escape. A woman who is looking to explore and discover her hidden inhibitions of sexuality. Is there a fantasy or guilty pleasure that crosses your mind?We all have them. Sometimes it just takes the right person to help release those hidden desires. There needs to be a trust to build upon. Knowing your partner will do anything and everything to make you feel safe and secure can give you the strength to enjoy something new and different.

About me. Well, I'm a 40 year old Latin guy, well spoken, friendly, funny, mature, and extremely passionate. I have olive toned skin, brown eyes, athletic muscular build (I'm not a hard body, but I'm not fat either), great smile with nice teeth, and I have shaved head with mustache and goatee. Upon first impressions you might find my appearance a bit intimidating, maybe even thug like, but I'm a teddy bear. I can be a thug if you want me too though. Lol. If you want tall, well I am not super tall, but I'm not a midget. I am very well proportioned with tons of energy. I can send you a pic or two if your interested. I'm also clean, STD free, and I don't do drugs. I don't judge though.

What do I like? A woman who is real. I'm attracted by a beautiful smile and kind heart. I don't discriminate. I think all women are beautiful in their own unique way. I do like wide hips though. I'll be honest, if you have thick in the rear then I'm all in. Lol

Well that's about it. Send me a message and let's see if there's an initial attraction or interest. Don't be afraid. Ask me a question and I'll answer it for you. Please don't respond if you're trying to sell something. 

To make sure you are a real person and decide to write back please write your favorite musical artist in the subject line.

Take care

Hi, I just moved back to town after spending years in New York. I am looking for a platonic friend to hang out with occasionally.

I'm looking to just give massages for guys who are sore from working out or stressed. I do this free.
I used to do massage therapy. Our job was to relax people, but funny enough it was relaxing
for me to give them. I mostly do backs, necks, but open to legs/arms. Just the hand movements,
circular patterns, etc... it all somehow relaxes me like painting or drawing lines in the sand.

In evenings I have a space I can do this in. Please email me your photo (because YES i do want to know who I'll be working on and coming into my space) and say what hurts on you or what's sore.

This is free. I'm not charging anything. So it's not a deep tissue massage, it's more about relaxation
and minor aches. If you want, it would be kind to bring your favorite bottle of lotion to use on you and take it back with you. 

About me: Actually so normal of a guy, I think I'm boring. I workout 3x a week, read, love music, hanging out with friends, have a full-time job, college educated, etc... I just like to do this for my own relaxation. I'm from a mix middle eastern/white/latin family, and that's about it. Thank you.

A bit about me: I am 29 years old, male, of Middle Eastern descent. I am a simple guy who enjoys going to the movies, spending time in nature, reading books, listening to music (like classical music), cooking and eating a healthy meal, hiking, etc.

For the most part, my life is full of blessings: a rewarding career, a quiet home and several loyal friends; but lately, my social life has grown rather dull. I'm hoping to find a thoughtful, articulate gal that needs to shake up her world a bit as well. Although I don't have a litany of requirements in a friend, we'll probably get along better if you

1) would rather walk than drive.
2) are done with ""the scene.""
3) would rather meet face-to-face than text.
4) like guys that shave their head.
5) live in the Valley (or not far from it).

Please don't try to help me find God, convince me to vote for Donald Trump, or ask me to father your next child. On my end, I can promise delightful manners, a patient ear, an open mind and excellent breath.

Not looking for a couch potato but I am looking for someone who loves smash potatoes. Enough with the jokes. Not a comedian but I'm trying. Anyways, if your into phototography and want to hang out without someone who won't try to get your panties down, unless you want them down, then I'm might be just a good fit. Please have a sense of humor for crying out loud. 

Please have a professional camera. An iPhone is not a professional camera. Yes, you could take wonderful selfies but selfie sticks are not allow anywhere around me, I'm allergic. 

Please reply back and attach an image of yourself and one your proud taking. Let's make it happen today, we might even be lucky to grab some lunch on this busy day. A picture of yourself gets a picture of mine.

In my fourth year in LA I decided to move to Hollywood to try it out, but did not realize how infrequently I would see my friends in Santa Monica! I do fine socially after an introduction, but my social phobia is bad enough that I cannot just go meet people at bars or on the street. PhD in neurosciences seems to do that to people...makes us a little socially weird maybe? I wish I was better at it, but Craigslist has apartments, cars, exercise equipment, why not friends?

I would love to have a few friends close by to grab the occasional coffee or cocktail, roll our eyes at the tourists, or do goofy tourist events around for fun. I did the no-pants subway ride OMG that was hilarious. 

No idea who reads these, but I have had roommates from all walks of life and get along with most people well enough. Faster friends might be more curious about the world, geeks, maybe a little weird too, and value being kind to others. I am huge into running and lift at LA fitness too if those happen to be of interest, but they don't need to be. I also would love to start going to this Tuesday 9PM fire spinning thing near by...maybe you would do a class there?

I have enough of a media issue that I prefer not to post a picture of publicly. I'm not famous by any stretch, but I'll explain in person. Let's just say I have a very weird job!

Hey guys, anyone into casual cuddling with movies/chats sometime? Recently decided to try the whole meeting strangers thing and wanted to give it a shot, so if you're curious about hanging, we can chat and see if we have similar interests and we'll go from there. I believe companionship can just be casual. Sometimes when it's lonely you just want to enjoy someone's company you know? So yeah that's what I'm looking to explore. It doesn't have to be platonic, we'll just see what clicks of course- but looking for friends above anything. I'm an open-minded, 20/Asian/6'0/200/DDF. I'm REALLY into Pokemon, Sbb4, mmorpgs, cooking, baking, horror movies, and always trying new places to eat- but open to talk about anything. I'm an open book :) It'd be awesome if some new friends come out of this. Please be drugs/disease free and hygienic as well. Send your stats and a pic please :) ttyl.

Hey there! Seems the older you get the harder it is to make new friends. Unfortunately some of my closest friends have moved away and I miss having those random hangouts. Outdoor days or wine and Netflix lazy days. I'm very down to earth. I'm 28, single, no kids, educated. I like to do all types of things from staying in to going out and having fun. I enjoy hikes, working out, cooking, dining, traveling, the beach, mountains, happy hours. I'm not really into clubs. I mean I can go once in a blue moon or if I'm away on a girls trip or something but generally not too often. I do enjoy going to bars sometimes though. I'd love to find a genuine person to get to know and hopefully build a solid friendship. Major plus if you're not crazy busy all the time and actually have time to hang out. Please email me a bit about yourself and I'll respond as soon as I can. FYI I don't care what race you are or your sexual orientation just be an easy going down to earth person!

I'm a very nice, caring, respectful, shy, and loyal type of person. I don't lie and I expect the same from you. Please know that this is for platonic only and be serious about this. Please don't reply if you're not serious to be friends. 
Some of my interests: I LOVE my video games!!!! 😋🎮 I love drawing and Art. I like walking to places, exercising, listening to a talk show, listening to music, reading, learning new things, cooking and baking GREAT food, and watching TV shows. 

Some music of my interests are: Punk, Alternative, Rock, Grunge, Metal, some Rap, and others. Most of the music I like is from the 70s-2005, because most new music now adays is crap. 

Examples of video games are: 🤔 GTA4, GTA 5 (I love this game 😊❤️), and other GTA games, Red Dead games (I'm waiting for the third one to be out ), Gears of War, Dying light, Watch Dogs, Heavy Rain, Forza Horizon 2 I think, Dead Rising 2and 3, Little Big Planet 3, The Last Of Us, Uncharted Series (waiting on the 4th to be out), Rockband 4, older PS3 games, Nintedo games, Sega games like Sonic, Arcade games, Dead Island, FALLOUT 4 ( HARD BUT FUN!) Walking Dead games and other games by Tell Tale, and MANY MORE! I suck at Boarder Lands, Portal, and COD games, but I do try.
😬🎮
My systems are Xbox One (which I mainly game on), PS4 and PS3, Wii ( I'm waiting for the NX ), 3DS, PSVita, and Steam. 😋🎮

I believe that common interests help a foundation for friendships. So being near my age helps. Knowing our childhood interests help us to reminisce over the past. A few things that I loved as a child are Sonic The Hedgehog cartoons and of course video game, Mario cartoon and Video game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Batman, and SEVERAL other cartoons. I read RL Stien books and watched the Goosebumps show as a kid. I really loved it as a kid. I watched a lot of movies and shows as a child. I as well loved reading comics. Many aspects of me haven't changed. I still love my video games and watching some cartoons and Anime. Though as an adult, I have my responsibilities as well. 😖😋 

Thank you all for reading this. I appreciate it greatly! 😋💕

Ps. Please say something more than hi. 😬 Also, female friends are welcome as well! 🙂✨

Just so you know because I am an honest person and I expect you to be the same. I am in a committed relationship with my Boyfriend of 6 years, but i am allowed to have a girlfriend or girl-friends lol. If you want he can come Join us in going out or he will have no involvement at all when we hangout because I understand it makes people uncomfortable. I'm not the type of wants my friends being uncomfortable so yeah. I enjoy a lot of things in life. If you do something you believe to fun tell me and take me so I can be evolved and witness new and exciting things life has to offer! We can start with email until we get to know one another or we can text! It doesn't matter just don't be a guy! I do not want any guys!!!

So I'm a 22 year old male and a cast member at Disney. I have recently decided that adventures are much more fun that parties and clubbing. All of my friends though are too weakened from working and going to school that unless it involves drinking with a big group of people they don't want to do it. I want someone who I can call or text spontaneously at night to just drive and find random places to explore be it a forest, concrete jungle, late night hike trails or anything just some sort of exploring and adventure. Sometimes I'd like to plan day trips to go out and do something or spend a weekend traveling to some camp ground in a random area and spend the weekend there. I'd like a female companion between the ages of 18-27 For this just because I feel more comfortable expressing my joy for adventure and feel I have the best in depth conversations with women. The point isn't to date or anything of that sort, it is to have a partner to adventure with and share wonderful moments and talk with. I currently reside in Fullerton but because I love driving and exploring I couldn't care less how far away you are I can always pick you up. Email if you are interest and put your favorite constellation and element in the subject line.

Im 6'1, 175 lbs, Average build, African American, good shape and I'd like to think decently attractive lol. Im a very fun and adventurous person love to go out and explore but it's no fun alone. Just want someone that i can have fun on the weekends with. Spending too much time alone. There's so much more i could say but that would take from the fun of getting to know me !

I've been thinking about my current female friends. I met them through work. So, I've decided to try to make new friends outside of my job. 

I'd like to make a new friend. Maybe, we can hang out together once in a while. I'm single but I'm not looking for a girlfriend or a wife. I'd like a female friend to go on outings (coffee shops, restaurants, movies, walks, etc.) with me. 

Again, I'm looking for a strictly platonic relationship, not a romantic one.

Please send me an email if you're interested. Please tell me about yourself. Name, city, favorite activities, etc. Thank you!

By the way, I'm in my late forties.

I am disabled asian 33m that was hit by a drunk driver. I use a power chair to get around.

Suffer from spinal cord injury. Will like to find a friend for activities and hobbies and food.

Some activities and hobbies I like are museums, parks, netflix, animals, food searching and cooking even though my strength severely limits me to almost everything, video games, board games, fishing, anime, photography, helping and meeting new people, conventions, shopping, talking to people on kickstarter etc.

I am a successful television writer/producer that lives and works in Los Angeles. Really.

And while that may sound good, working in the entertainment business comes with its setbacks. Long hours. An unpredictable schedule. And not many opportunities to meet new people, namely because socializing with the people I work with is a no-no.

So, that means finding a companion to go out and do things with is often not easy.

Right now, I'm hoping to meet someone fun, intelligent and attractive who can be a great activity partner. If more develops, cool. If not, that's okay too.

Here are some of the things I like to do: Attend live theater, concerts, film, and sporting events, travel, check out new restaurants, visit museums, and do various other activities, some related to the industry.

So, if you work in the biz, or at least have an interest in things regarding entertainment, that would be great. I am pretty well-versed in popular culture (film, music, theater), and if you aren't, you should be open to learning more from a great teacher. Or turning me on to new cool stuff, too.

One last thing: Even though I work in the business, but I'm not obsessed with it. I'm easily able to turn off my cell phone during a movie, concert or a show, and you should be too.

Now some details about me: I'm a single, never married, Caucasian male, that's 6' tall, about 185 pounds, clean-shaven, dark brown hair, deep blue eyes, 40-ish. I'm fit, well-toned, intelligent, able to converse on a wide variety of subjects, down to earth, casual and quick-witted.

About you: I'm open to meeting a woman of any race. It's all good. However, I'm most likely to be drawn to someone in their 20s or early 30s, on petite side, dark hair, thin, fit, in-shape.

We'll get along if you are independent, up on current events, able to make conversation, fun, and adventurous enough to be outgoing and try new things, but not necessarily a raging extrovert. Cool, quiet and demure works too.

And you should have a great sense of humor. At least good enough to be able to tell when I'm cracking wise, and laugh at the appropriate times.

Emails with pictures go to the head of the line.

Are there any cute girls -- of any legal age -- who might like to kick back today, have a toke, hang out, meet someone new, and sure, MAYBE even get naked?

I'm a guy, basically easygoing, intelligent, even fun. I'm fairly flexible about what we do, but generally just hang and yes, maybe get naked, although that is not required, just an idea to enhance things. Maybe talk, or we can listen to music, or watch a video (I have several very good ones on hand), go for a walk in the park -- sure, any of that MAYBE naked (except the park, of course).

Tell me your ideas, I'm open to whatever. I would simply enjoy the company, regardless of what we might do, and it doesn't have to be naked. Hey, maybe we even will make a new friend. Or more.

I'm older, middle age, so you have to be OK with that -- whether you're older, younger, it all works for me. Either way, even if an age difference, I'm sure you would be comfortable with me, I'm cool enough. I'll bet I even could make you laugh. We should trade pics when I hear from you; again, I think you will be satisfied.

So there you go. Get in touch -- the day is getting older.

I feel a little silly posting this ad, but I'd love to make a new friend to go on adventures with and someone I can be myself around. I feel like I need to start a new phase in my life and surround myself with light and positivity. I'm 27 years old, just got out of a long term relationship, college educated, I have a steady job and I live in the Los Angeles area. Some of my interests include reading, photography, nature, music (everything from 90's alternative rock to French pop i.e Francoise Hardy), vintage, scouring thrift stores/flea markets, visiting coffee shops and baking/cooking. I love going to shows, art galleries/museums, bars, and checking out new restaurants. I'd love to meet someone who shares my similar interests. 

Send me an e-mail and please include age, location, and any other information you feel will help me get to know you a little more. 

Thanks ♡

So that may seem a suspect title but bear with me a moment.

I have long wanted to interact with someone in such a way where she
tells me what to do, and I obey. Non-sexual. Serious about that...I am
not looking for sex.

For instance, you tell me to wash the dishes and it is done. Perhaps you 
have other chores? In a perfect world we'd exchange a lot of emails
to ensure we're both comfortable, then move to the power exchange.

If this piques your interest at all feel free to respond and share your thoughts.
I am white, 40's, nice looking and actually pretty normal. I simply have this
fantasy I'd like to experience.

Thank you

To be honest, I used to know this very attractive woman. We were good friends and we loved each other. We weren't really a couple but we still kissed every now and then. I don't know if you've ever had a friendship like this but it was nice :) But it all happened so naturally. I was younger too. I'm not sure if I will ever have that type of relationship again especially if I ask for it on craigslist. 

When we did normal every day things it was extremely exciting. We weren't doing anything but simple every day things. But with so much love, every day things were extremely fun. I wouldn't have wanted to be anywhere else when I was with her. 

So.. I'm not really looking for a LTR but strictly platonic doesn't fit it either... I guess somewhere in between? But I'd rather have a loving platonic relation rather than worrying about a LTR

I miss tagging along on errands and just being there for someone when they need me. 

I miss being there to listen and there to entertain and be silly. 

I want a friend who isn't judgmental. 

I'm not a hardcore goal oriented person. I'm here today and gone tomorrow. I don't really worry about lifetime achievements. 

But, I do like being around nice women. :)

I think being educated is important to an extent. You don't have to know all of the secrets of the universe. You don't need a college degree or a fat salary. 
You don't need to be rich or a genius.

I'm going CRAZY in this room without any sleep! I don't know why you have to choose a sexual preference when in ""Strictly Platonic"" but seeing as I get along better with women I don't really mind. 
A little about me. 
i saw a baby seal the other day. It was cool. 
I LOVE THE DECEMBERISTS. 
AND THE SHINS. AND THE BEATLES. AND ELLIOTT SMITH. AND BRIGHT EYES.
AND THE CURE. and the list goes on, but enough about me, tell me about.... ME. Oh right this isn't a conversation, this is an introduction, duh dude, wake the fuck up. Your insomnia has proven to be stronger than your need for energy in the daytime, and now you've resorted to CRAIGSLIST to talk to (and like) the crazy stalkers of the night!
Ah sorry i'm just really hyper, no sleep gets me hyper? strange right? 
Well i'm a human being(and hopefully whoever responds is too, and that's probably like, the one girl on craigslist tonight, drinking too much coffee and listening to the Smiths) and i'm full of contradictions just like everyone else. 
I'm an extremely selfish person, OH YEAH, because it makes me happy to see other people happy, and I'd do just about anything to make someone happy. Jeez dude, you're such a douche. 
Let's ask the studio audience. Is he as self centered and douchey as he proclaims? Let's cut to commercials.
I'm making this as strange as possible because then only the reaaaaaally interesting people will respond.
Yeah, you lady, sitting there with your pinky up drinking your tea like ""THIS YOUNG MAN HAS LOST HIS MARBLES"", I'm talking about you. DON'T bother responding if you've:
-Never been the only person in the room to laugh at something, and then had everyone look at you like WTF is wrong with that chick/dude
-Never had your heart broken
-Never stayed up all night just to see the sunrise
-Don't have a favorite song(genre's are genre's, songs are songs)
- If your favorite color is turquoise or maroon.
-Just kidding, if you have a favorite color, you're cool in my book
-Don't find dogs even remotely interesting
-If you don't like yourself
-Well if you don't like yourself you can still respond, who knows I MIGHT LIKE YOU enough for the both of us :)

Seriously though, I'll turn no one away. If you're awake, lets talk.
I can be charming, goofy, stupid, BRILLIANT, and plenty of other things. 
I'm looking for a friend, or someone to talk to, with shared interests or COMPLETELY OPPOSITE interests.
I don't care, I love interacting with anyone.
AND NO, I'm NOT ON DRUGS. 
BUT my mood can be addictive. 
So come smile with me.
email me, let's shoot the shit, tell some jokes, talk shit about all our best friends and then giggle as they walk by.
BEAUTIFUL LADIES NEED NOT APPLY.
just kidding, you're more than welcome, but don't get jealous that I have better hair than you, and probably know more about female anatomy.

Hello there and thank you for taking the time to read my post.
As we enter the Spring Season, there no time better than now to get started working out.

I'm a 26 year old lesbian and my two partners are 22 and 32 year old bi women.
I work as an Entertainment Consultant/Talent Scout and often manage specialized fashion campaigns. 
Currently, my plan is to meet at my home 3 - 4 times a week, for a light calisthenic routine.

The focus would be on the essential exercises, such as Push-Ups, Crunches, Lunges, Squats and Leg Raises. This type of workout has everything needed for developing a solid base. 
In addition to a lovely location and beautiful women, this opportunity comes with two Energy healing and realignment sessions performed by a 20 year expert and Maya Shaman.
By Summer, we will have a nice photo shoot on the company yacht to show off all of our hard work. 
To ensure that your submission is received please use ""goddess bi summer"" as your subject line.
All ethnicities welcome, please be between the ages of 18 - 32.
BI AND LESBIAN WOMEN ONLY

Please respond with photos and your stats. 

Thank you!

Looking for someone to chat, txt, BS, hangout, have some fun and make new friends. As the word platonic states, simply friends. Recently made changes to my life and adjusting to a clean slate; meeting new people, going places, making conversation and just passing the time with some quality company. I appreciate a good sense of humor on all levels, and truly just to be able to laugh with someone.

I'm:
a gym rat
musician
horror/sci-fi enthusiast, conspiracy theory fun-atic (not fanatic)
comic fanatic
adventurer
traveler
into tattoos
Don't smoke, not a hardcore boozer, 
Am a bit of chatterbox

...if you wanna know more let's chat, so hit me up....I can also do Kik if you got it as well

I want to start life completely over.

I'm 40.
Divorced.
No kids.
No pets.
I own a house.
I own my car.
I'm highly educated.
I'm highly successful.

But since the divorce, I wish to pretty much:
- sell the house
- sell everything in the house
- sell the car
- find a new job
- find a new female partner to enjoy life with
- find a new church
- find new purpose

Basically, I wish to start life over at 40.

Am I odd?
Am I asking for too much?
Am I doomed?

Have you been thru this yourself?

Well not in any particular order actually, and yes I get I am posting on CL of all places.

I would like in free moments to have some fun and adventures in the real world, and welcome anyone with similar interests to maybe come along in your free moments too? I am single, would always be open to more if it develops, but have found most people seem to think everything is some sort of commitment instead of just enjoying the fun and adventurous moments. I choose to seek and enjoy any moment I can with positive people, as time is precious and hoping maybe can reach activity partners here.

Other times I have deadlines and commitments, and sometimes for hours into days, and I end up unwinding reading the CL posts for the great laugh out loud posts I seek. Sure sometimes I get educated, searching for the needle in the haystack or diamond in the rough.... but come on... we are mostly reading for the fabulous entertainment value at our fingertips right?

So I seek some sanity, some witty or intelligent banter, so I can make it through sometimes some very stressful moments. I have a brain, I have wit, and I know how to use it.

Am I going to send you to some site to sign up, or am I a guy...... No. It is just little ol' me on the other end of the screen. I am a white HWP 5' 8"" female, and from birth too! So no need to worry or ask.

So if anyone has some free moments to share, let me know. You are here reading anyway right? While many are not adventurous enough to post, are you adventurous enough to respond? Hmmmmm....

Hey,

Looking for someone who is available evenings after work to play tennis. I would say I'm about 3.5 right now but can hang with better players, looking for someone around my rating or better. Looking for someone who wants to practice and get better by doing drills, crosscourts, down the lines, volleys, overheads, short balls, slices, etc.etc. And playing maybe a set after that. I would say an hour and a half is good for me right now.

Tell me a little your game and your availability, thanks.

Male or female, doesn't matter, just looking for someone around my ability or better. This ad is genuinely for tennis only. I am in a relationship. Thanks.

Hello there, yes, i am real and today is 3/5/16
PLZ, DO NOT judge that Im married, and do not think im some low-lifer. read then you can judge later.
I was browsing cl, and the amount of prostitution is unbelievable. This is why I decided to post on the platonic section, although I'm actually looking for more. 
I am a Arab-American, born and raised in Orange County-. I've been married for 5 yrs, no kids, and intimacy has gone and i think its due to my career. communication wise, there is none. We are pretty much roommates but we care for one another, and im not looking to leave her.
I am a former military and a former cop and I can smell BS from miles away. so, please, if you decide to reply, all I ask is be who you are and respectful. I am 35 yrs old. I stand about 5-9, 188, lb, in good shape, fit, light skinned, brown dark eyes, military clean cut. I'm self-employed, well-off and well-educated. not to sound cocky but darn confident and i wouldn't need CL.
I earned everything myself through my education and career.
I am a dominant male who is RESPECTFUL and yet down-to-earth. I pretty much am looking for the same except the dominate part. and when I say im dominate, please don't think im some jerk or pervert man who can not get laid. believe me, if I just wanted to get laid, I can. but im looking for more than just sex. 
If you are in the same boat and interested in just chatting and MAYBE meet up for dinner, then you should be somewhat FIT, DRUG-FREE, mature, and have something going on for yourself. 
If this is you, then please reply with (In the same Boat) in the subject so I know you read this. please no one-liner. 
No, i will not ask for a pic. i respect privacy and i take it very seriously. 
looking forward.

You are 30-mid 40s, slim to medium built, preferably smooth or somewhat hairy; Caucasian, Asian or...... You must be very clean, ddf, and a non-smoker. If you are seriously interested in getting together with the coach, please respond with your age, stats, and recent self pics. Include your face pic (It's safe - it will stay with me).

I'm open to traditional or gestational surrogates. I'm not interested in scam artists or women who ""aren't sure"" if they want to be a surrogate. If you, or anyone you know, that lives in/near the Los Angeles area, would be interested, please message me. An altruistic surrogate is my preference. 

Thank you, Gregory

My greatest gift of all is my ability to love a person so very deeply. I am talking about a kind of love that exists on all levels, beyond earthly emotions. I've realized that there aren't many people that will ever be able to feel or understand it. But(!) I know that you are out there. You've got to be, because I can't be the only one. Maybe not here on CL, but somewhere here on Earth.

My heart feels like as if it were a never ending ferocity, glowing inside of me and always telling me the sometimes illogical truth whether I want it or not. And I just can't help that I find discussions about existential ideas a lot more interesting than talking about people or events.

I appreciate aesthetic beauty in all its forms. But what really turns me on are things like kindness, courage, and intelligence(and not competence): attributes which I can see as clear as anything else but not with the physical eye. I am often alone but I never feel lonely. I've studied philosophy, but I'm not wise because of that. I speak different languages but my silence is louder than my words. 

These are things I've realized about myself in my time on this planet. Perhaps you feel the same way, or have realizations of your own. I keep the hope alive that somewhere out there is someone willing to say ""hi"" and take a chance.

What's up! I'm looking for a serious workout partner. I do work at a gym and I had some trainers but due to a little financial situation I had to stop, but I still need to hit the gym or just basically exercise on a regular and I need to do it hard...but it's hard to stay motivated on the real, so I was hoping if I had some one to workout with it would make it easier. I do have T25, Insanity, Hip Hop abs etc and that's cool but I get bored easily and I want to lift some weights as well. Like I stated before I work for a gym. 24 hour fitness to be exact. I'm trying to lose 20 lbs or so since I weigh about 167 lbs and we can help support each other. I'm putting this into the strictly platonic section because my priority is to get a workout partner. I am not looking for sex or anything of that nature for real. It would help if you do have a membership at a 24 hour fitness. It would also help if you are somewhat in shape too. Not trying to over look anyone but I would need someone that knows what they are doing if anything. Thank you, hit me up and we can take it from there

Email me if you are interested and tell me about yourself.

Thanks!

For once I have a little time to myself! I'm usually pretty busy, but I have some downtime this weekend. I'm a 23 year old student (full time), and actively pursuing activities related to my field already. Occasionally, like tonight I get a little time to myself. I'm not really big on going out to the bar, or spending a lot of money at this point in life. So I figured I'd post this AD and see who replies. 

Maybe by some slight chance of luck ( an outgoing; attractive; cool) girl might come across this and reply. 

Let's meet up for a cup of coffee and chat/ watch a movie. 

No pressure to have sex ; if you want to you can come onto me, but if not you won't have to worry about me doing anything.. Unless you tell me to ;)

I am currently researching some information for a book, and much of the information I need is located in LA and West Hollywood. I am based near Chicago, so visiting the places in person is not an option right now.

I am hoping I can find someone who would be willing to drive by a house on Horn Ave. in West Hollywood and find out some information for me. The house I am researching is a Tudor style home located at the end of the street. There are two houses on the property, with the other being located behind the Tudor style home. 

The house itself is marked as being number 1229, however, the front curb is marked as 1227. I am unsure if the 1227 address is referring to the other house located behind the Tudor home, or if the Tudor style home was split into a duplex style home and has one address for one side and another address for the other.

I am hoping someone local wouldn't mind stopping by there and seeing if they can figure it out for me. There was a robbery at this property in the 1970s that is directly related to the book I am writing, and figuring out the exact address is the first step in finding more information.

This listing is in the platonic female friendships category. I'm looking to make some gal pals, female friends, but I am also open to the idea of also making some platonic make friends also.

I have several invisible illnesses...chronic health conditions which are not contagious and not obvious from looking at me. I look normal but I feel sick a lot. 

This has made it hard to make friends because I sleep a lot, and fatigued a lot, and sometimes have to cancel plans if I'm not well. 

I'm a caring compassionate low energy friend who is really great at giving useful advice. I am a talented part time telephone only based therapist. 

I'm hoping to make a friend who lives near me or could travel to my area to get together for low energy activities like going out to eat or just hanging out and chatting. 

My perfect scenario would be to get together once a week in the beginning with my new friend and mostly to use texting just to make plans. 

I have lived most of my life in social isolation and Facebook doesn't cut it- I need a real life in person friend or two. 

So if you are lonely also and open to hangoing out once in a while, in my area, shoot me an email.

Hola,

It's Friday night and I've had a busy week and looking to unwind. Are you up to doing something tonight, short notice, and completely spontaneous (by spontaneous I don't mean ""let's watch a movie on the couch"") ?

Let's see, in thinking we could go see a movie in theaters , go dance some bachata (or scream at the Dj to play bachata). Perhaps you have a buddy and you can invite him and me my girlfriend. Yay foursome awkward silences! Downtown? Pasadena? Long beach?

Me: 35, single, short, 175, smart, spunky working professional. I love travel, reading, and yelling at djs, fluent in Spanish 

You: 30s,40s single, smart, not short like me, extra super bonus points if you speak Spanish, have a passport and college educated. 2 points extra if you think going out is better than CL tonight.

Hi, I'm looking for a friend to talk to. I'm interested in music and film. My favorite book is On the Road by Kerouac, but I would like to educate myself more on litarture and the arts. I'm a musician and film student. I've recently become very intersted in classical music and am eager to learn more. I also enjoy the works of composers like George Gershwin and Burt Bacharach. In addition, silent movies are a new found passion. I'm also interested in social commentary and have admired the works of speakers like Allan Watts, Noam Chomsky and Krishnamurti. I enjoy spiritual talks as well. I'm trying to make time to learn French too! I've traveled to Europe before and would love to go back. I'm often told that I'm an old soul which makes sense I guess. I've never really been able to fit amongst my peers as I am often disinterested in their social activities or conversations. It would be nice to find a friend with similar interests.

I only welcome Christian Women who are sweet, easy - going and easy to get along with but ARE INTELLIGENT AND RELIABLE. Excellent communicators. 

LA is so filled with too many flakes and unintelligent life forces. If you are one of them, please refrain from writing me.... 

Just want to go to the beach and Rollerblade tomorrow, Sunday! :) 

Ages 28-45 welcome. Healthy personalities only. I have my own skates, but you can rent them for $10 an hr at the SM pier. 

I'm a Christian, and serious about it. 

Other things that matter!! Kindness. Character. Integrity. Sincerity. Honest to a fault!!! I prefer people who are honest to a fault than charming like a snake charmer!! Charm is deceitful!!

Mutually kind and caring friendships are what I'm interested in.

Fluent English speakers only. :) All races.

Women only. No men. Strictly platonic. Nonsmokers only. No drugs. No addicts. No drama.

If you are SERIOUSLY interested and fit the bill, you MUST send me detailed info about yourself. This is the internet. I need to make sure we are compatible. :) Be ready to talk on the phone immediately within the week!! Must talk before we meet. Thanks for your interest! :)

-I have an ENFP personality. 
-Currently working two part time jobs. 
-I am professional working in higher education institutions. 
-Born and raised in south central LA. 
-Come from a big family, but seriously tho. 
-I love to make others laugh and be silly and goofy. I am considered to be the class clown. -Life is too short to waste it on negative things. 
-Not too much into sports unless UCLA and/or USC plays.

Hi!!
If you're pregnant and feeling lonely I'd love to take you out to dinner, or a movie, and just make you feel special. Nothing creepy or sexual, simply a chance to make a new friend and maybe both of us can feel a little better along the way. I think pregnant women are beautiful and I don't think there's any shame in that. I'm a down-to-earth, funny guy who just wants to try something new. It doesn't hurt that I'm also a great listener and conversationalist! 

Send me a message if you think you'd maybe like to get to know me, and we can go from there :)

Holding each other close, snuggling, and enjoying each other's presence is a great way to relax into bliss and feel good. No sex or happy ending. Perhaps a full body, amateur massage followed by rest and some TLC would feel nice. Looking for average, h/w proportionate, clean cut Straight/Bi/Gay males yearning for nurturing touch, connection and kindness. All ages are welcome. Be who you are, be free of that social persona, feel good, and rest/relax in the safety of caring affection. A friendly cuddle reduces stress and anxiety, is healthy for body and soul, develops trust, is an instant way to come alive and certainly is great for feeling bonded to another. Having a good heart is what this is all about. Affection, Friendship, Caressing, Massage, Hugging, Care, Tactile, Respect, Trust, In-Spirit, and Feeling Safe -- Wow Terms! Let me know if there is any interest in this. I am Caucasian, h/w proportionate, understanding, and discreet looking for similar -- plus there is never a charge. We simultaneously have the opportunity to experience some inner freedom and wholeness in the present moment through touch.

Hey ladies, 
I am female, 25 years old.

I am an executive assistant and I am looking for a driver. 

I am looking for a female driver with a valid drivers license. 

I will pay 10$ an hour for rides. 

**** I make websites and with my new assistant position I can not find the time to make websites. I would love for the driver I hire to want to learn how to make websites. I want to give website development jobs to the driver I hire. There's a beautiful place to work where I work, while I'm doing work the driver would be building websites. If you don't have a computer that's okay, I have a computer you can use and I will teach and assist with any complications that come with web building. 

This may sound complicated, life is wild and I am very serious about this.

I paint, draw, sculpt, love life, design, I make music, learn new things everyday, I am on point. I'd love to find another girl who is on point and ready to learn & work.

My schedule is almost unpredictable so I'm looking for the right person who has a lot of time on their hands....

Only females reply, I do not want to spend any amount of time with guy, especially if I'm paying for the time lol... 


*** there's no sexual or weird things attached to this... I am a female, I am straight.

*** I do not do illegal things
this is for rides to work, errands, events, anything/ everything. 

*** I'd like to set up interviews asap so please reply if you think I'm looking for you. 

Thanks everyone !
Stay Blessed :)

Also, don't hate on 10 per hour, I wish I could pay more, that's why I'm coupling the job with website building so the person I hire can make money in more ways than one.

Mostly Calvin Klein trunks. Multiple colors. Small size which is usually for waist size 29 to 32.
Looking for ideally at least 10 bucks each so 100 total.

Very serious here though about finding a buyer...Looking for someone serious to buy my stuff...
If you want to cum over to my place (in NOHO) and check out the stuff in person, totally cool. Try them on, make sure they fit.
Basically, I'm a motivated seller. ;) My KIK is hotfacedbud

Please don't email me with just ""how much?"" Send me some details on you, when you are looking to come over and check them out and what you are offering.

Please possibly-Allow Us: 2 FIND work as an apt. management team 2 live rent FREE!

Aloha Human Honey,

I seek to team up with you and LOCATE apartment management work together! We can be partners as living-work-room-dream-mates to enjoy the benefit of FREE RENT if we collect it and account for it. Please consider my proposal to be my apprentice and associate to establish an apartment management and/or supervision team. 
You are welcome 2 co-exist; with me here in Temecula, CA: until we locate work. 
This is a career opportunity requiring honest happy intelligence; providing flexibility to develop other sources of income and achieve personal goals. Many positions require a TEAM to administrate and supervise maintenance. I promise: I can work and live together joyously; because the joy of a good job and luxurious living space predicate dreams of Love. I am trilingual Love/Spanish/English with 10 years experience managing apartments in the Southern California area. Your abilities and beauty add to our resume especially if you know another language.
Ladies are more compatible to me; psychologically, philosophically, physically, psychically, and politically: therefore; I seek a Lady work partner, to share living space because working together daily; is easy with pleasant personalities and an honest desire for lucrative longevity. Being a team mate facilitates acquiring work: as a Human Resource person advised me; ""I would hire you: BUT; our insurance doesn't want a lonely guy with the keys to beautiful peoples' apartments"". I promise to cooperate and handle our lack or enjoyment of a sexual reality with dignity; according to our eternal compatibilities and your desires. 
There are three ways we can prosper; 1. We locate work as business apprentice-associate-partners and employees to receive a salary and an apartment to reside in, 2. Contract work as Absolute Supervision my company to earn a percentage of; the gross collected rents we collect, 3. We buy with a zero $ down payment deal; we submit generous purchase proposals benefitting seller to acquire and operate apartment buildings. 
Every month our rent will be free plus a salary which depends on amount of units we manage and our responsibilities: or we develop a cash flow from buildings we acquire. It is easy to enjoy being rewarded for: executive honesty to collect rents and manage fairly/equally so tenants can quietly enjoy their apartment homes. Some positions have expensive building rents; therefore, housing is not included. Thus, we earn a generous salary, live off-site at an income property we purchase and own together.
All conditions are negotiable; and we shall respect the promises we establish.
1. We can exist harmoniously and enjoy life where we dream, eat, work and exercise. 
2. I shall respect your privacy and will abide by all living conditions we agree to.
3. I exist as a EVO-lacto-vegetarian; yet, I appreciate all appetites.
4. I am 420 compatible; I party with moderation to celebrate life socially
I am a dignified professional: upgrading my career, I shall excel with an effervescent partner. Our mutual cooperation will earn us a new apartment home with responsibilities to orchestrate a functional housing complex that enhances the community. I have the willingness to work anywhere in Southern California. I am well researched 'cultural vulture'; I co-exist with all cultures of people joyfully and I enjoy the best from all ethnicities to promote and establish world peace with prosperity. I an avid advocate and member of the US GREEN tea PARTY because: we must help our global village avoid extinction! Our World SOUL-U-tion; is #LOVEvolution: first end hunger, then dissipate hate, vanquish violence, dismantle nuclear reactor/weapons, and cure cancers! Thank you: your time and consideration are appreciated.
My offer for a live in apprenticeship: is contingent on our compatibility; I appreciatively consider all offers for barter, work, lodging, counseling, and especially Love.
JESUS, GOD and scientific Logic command: LOVE your neighbor; and bake Love-cake. 
Mahalo Peace and Love all ways: Robert aka mr-funsun.	
p.s. In my LIFE: seduction begins in a Lady's heart: thus; if you are not attracted to me, I can forget romance and excel at profitability while we help preserve oxygen and water to establish human dignity for all. I promise to adhere to our agreement and exist in harmony: because; I respect and adore ladies, my final sexual fantasy is to create babies. I produce peoples' dreams; not seduce people, I exist to help people achieve contentment.

Not trying to hook up, but give you the perfect hook up that benefits us both! Even potentially the start of an awesome friendship. Spoil yourself with steam facials, stunning eyelash extensions, body scrubs, waxing & my signature head to toe massages. Don't wait, interested, we can start asap!

I am an Asian undergrad who is working, working out, and working out the kinks in life. I'm learning to be more open to new people around me. I am more comfortable to meet over near a coffee place or shopping plaza to get to know anyone. 

Its a goal of mind to make at least one friend of each ethnicity. So far I am lacking any friends that are White/Black/Indian/Etc. Basically I only have Asian friends. Age wise, I hope you would be around at least 20 but at most 34. I feel that a decade more than my age would count enough to be my life mentor's age rather than a friend. Let me know of your ideas about what would be fun to do.

Are there any cute girls (or women) -- of any legal age -- who might like to kick back this afternoon, have a toke, hang out, meet someone new, and sure, MAYBE even get naked, although that is not necessary? 

I'm a guy, basically easygoing, intelligent, even fun. I can even make you laugh -- whether with me or at me, who cares. I'm sure I could make you happy.

I'm fairly flexible about what we do, but generally just hang and yes, maybe get naked, although that is not required, just an idea to enhance things and get your attention. Maybe talk, or we can listen to music, or watch a video (I have several very good ones on hand), go for a walk in the park -- sure, any of that MAYBE naked (except the park, of course). Tell me your ideas, I'm open to whatever. I would simply enjoy the company, regardless of what we might do, and it doesn't have to be naked. Hey, maybe we even will make a new friend. Or more.

I'm older, middle age, so you have to be OK with that -- whether you're older, younger, it all works for me. Either way, even if an age difference, I'm sure you would be comfortable with me, I'm cool enough. We should trade pics when I hear from you; again, I think you will be satisfied.

So there you go. Get in touch -- the day is only getting older.

Hello,

My name is Brendan and I am a 24 year old gay male. I recently relocated from Seattle to LA. My roommate is having family visit for the month of March. I agreed that because he has a few family members coming to stay, that I would find a couch to surf for the month. This has proven more difficult than I expected. I have been staying with my friend who lives in DTLA however parking is extremely expensive and I cannot come and go as I please in the parking lot that is available. Currently, I am working in nightlife on the weekends and am looking for social work jobs. In the past I have worked with foster youth. 

I am looking for a couch to surf in LA. I am a friendly, outgoing person who enjoys doing yoga, having a beer, and meeting new people. I would not be apposed to helping out around the house in exchange for a place to crash for a few nights. 

Feel free to ask any questions you may have.

This is Danielle again.

I just moved in to a new place and already, my roommate is switching the rules on me. So I'm going to start looking for somewhere else to go. Idealy near Burbank, Glendale or Pasadena. Or Van Nuys, North Hollywood.

Last time I looked I had people contact me from Thousand Oaks. That's just TOO far. So please, if you don't have anything in the cities I've mentioned, don't waste your time asking, thank you.

I am clean, quiet and dependable. I am between work assignments, so I can pay rent, just don't have enough for a deposit on top of rent. I work in the entertainment industry as an executive assistant.

I can afford between $400-$500 a month max.

If you are looking for help with rent and have a spare room, please drop me a line. Thanks so much, I'm 5' 6"", brown hair, pleasant smile. I am also gluten free and a vegetarian. Thanks for reading.

I am a 48-year-old, 6ft, 150lb., straight, white male, who grew up in a Jewish household, but without my father in the picture, and without being part of or subject to a lot what is involved in raising a Jewish child, i.e. without a Tanakh in the household.

Over the years, I have found the fact of not having a father around has been a tremendous void, and is one that I am now seeking to fill.

Specifically, what I am looking for are weekly sessions, for however long that day that they would take, which would feature three parts:

1. TANAKH (GENERALLY WEEKLY TORAH & HAFTORAH PORTIONS) - We would read both in advance (I would read in English, as I only made it through 4 years of Hebrew school), and we would discuss the meanings, and specifically, the values that can be derived from each.

2. PERSONAL, FATHERLY ADVICE - I would present to you one to three issues that I have been having in my life, and you would provide your best fatherly advice on those issues, drawing on your life experience, Jewish law, or whatever other source you can bring to bear. I grew up without getting a lot of critical input that my father wasn't around to provide, so I am trying to make up for that.

3. DISCIPLINE - POTCH IN TUCHUS - Proverbs 10:17 provides that ""He who follows discipline shows the way to life, but he who ignores reproof leads astray.""--JPS Hebrew English Tanakh, 1999. 

In this phase of our meetings, I would present an issue or behavior which I have committed, for which I feel that I should be disciplined by my father. (I grew up without my father, and those that raised me chose not to spank me when I needed it, but many years ago, as a teen, or earlier, I recognized it would have been the right way to go for me, and would have helped me a great deal.)

Accordingly, after identifying the matter, I would present you with a razor strop, for your use; you, in turn, would tell me how many swats you thought I deserved, and if it was over 25, we would split it into sets. I would take that from you, face down on a bed, stripped to a jockstrap, and the hugs and comforting that would follow afterword, as you show your parental love for me . 

I know this type of accountability would have made a difference then, as I believe my real father would have done it to me, had he lived and stuck around to raise me -- and will now, with you serving in loco parentis. He was a proud Korean War vet, and must have been a tough guy, who would have commanded my unconditional respect fron a strap if it came to that.

Accordingly, if you are a Jewish male, age 48 on up, and are a traditional, old-school Jewish father figure or father, or believe you can fill that role on an ongoing basis, either once a week or once every two weeks, in sessions, please write with your age, stats, general location, experience, and your ability to host the sessions.

I know this is quite a lot to ask of one person, but if you feel you fit this bill, write me as I've requested above.

Hi there,

So this may seem out of place in the listings, but hey, I thought it was worth a shot. 

I find myself craving something in my life and I believe that that something is more solid and long term friendships with kind hearted, spiritual, open minded and compassionate individuals.

So you may think..why go all the way across the pond to find that?

I guess in a way I feel I have exhausted many friendship avenues here and believe somewhere like LA will may have a more eclectic and open minded group of individuals that I am struggling to find in the UK. 

I consider myself very open minded, I don't care about your sexuality, race or gender identity. I just ask that you are a honest, open and generally a good person. 

About me: I love thrift shopping, deep conversations, inspirational and uplifting movies, aswell as a good comedy, I have recently become a bit of a you tube addict ( I love Just Latasha, Kat Blaque, Just Between Us, Buzzfeed aswell as some great ASMR channels), I like theater shows, vintage events, festivals, travelling, learning about new cultures, I study psychology so I am also very interested in the inner workings of peoples minds. 

So if this sounds like anything you are interested in then please get in touch.

Hayley

Hi. Are you bored throughout the day like me? Are you not getting the attention at home that you require? Are you in a relationship that seems to be going nowhere? Are you staying because you have kids and don't want to change your situation? Do you feel that because you're curvy or have extra padding that no one finds your attractive? Well then we have something in common.. I'm Joe, and I unfortunately can answer yes to all these questions. So I'm here posting for someone like minded to become great friends with. A little bit about me....I'm a Hispanic man in my early 40's. I am a very compassionate and kind man. I like football, the walking dead, star wars, metal music. I do have a child. I love Disney and going to theme parks. I don't smoke or do drugs. I drink socially. Enjoy going to the beach and camping and fishing . Love sushi and food trucks. I love to read... Mostly history or historical fiction. I'm non judgmental and very honest. I miss having a connection with someone. I enjoy innocent flirting. I find women with curves or bbw to be very attractive. I'm kind of shy at first as I've been in a ltr for 10 plus years so don't really have much experience approaching women.... Thus a texting friend would seem to be the best way to meet someone new. I'm not looking to change my situation at this time as my daughter is 7 years old. I'm in the east San Gabriel valley in case location matters.

Hi. I'm Joe. I'm 42. I'm a Hispanic man. I'm looking for a best friend. Strictly platonic! I have a girlfriend of 14 years. I have one daughter turning 8. I'm looking for a buddy. Someone to hang out with occasionally with and without the family. I'm a die hard Ucla Bruin and Green Bay Packers fan. I enjoy camping and fishing. As a family we are really into Disney and Disneyland, although at the moment we do not have annual passes. I enjoy reading...mostly history or historical fiction. I'm into action and comedy movies. I'm a big The Walking Dead fan. I love food trucks... especially Grill'EmAll. I listen to mostly Alternative and metal... AC/DC, Metallica, The Offspring, Linkin Park, Green Day, Ozzy, etc. I enjoy playing my Xbox, but do not have Xbox Live... enjoy zombie related games Dead Rising, Dead island, The walking dead, SIM games.... Topico 4, Sid Meyers Civilization, first person shooter.... The Brother in Arms series. I feel funny having to post here looking for a friend, but over the years all my buddies have drifted away... Sometime I just need that male bonding that seems to have slipped away. I'm a normal guy... non judgmental, very respectful. I'm a social drinker, but never to excess. I do not smoke or do drugs, however I do enjoy a nice cigar once in a while. I'm hoping to find that buddy that will remain close friends for years to come. I do have Facebook and Twitter, so I'd we do become friends hopefully communication through social media will occur. Again this is for platonic friends only... at no time will there be anything otherwise. If you're interested in making a lifelong new friend, please respond.

I don't want to fall in love. I just want to feel a little more life. It is also very important that this woman be close to my age. I am truly open to ALL races and ethnicities.

Hello, my name is Daisy. I have TMAU which is a condition that makes me smell bad, so I don't get out much. I am looking for friends to talk to throughout the day. Nothing sexual just conversation. I recently started making youtube videos & I created a few social media accounts so follow if you want or send a message me so we can talk. I don't have many friends or people to talk to besides my dogs, so it would be nice.

I'm new to LA and I love everything outdoors including zoos, museums, and national parks. I find them fascinating!

I'm seeking a friend who also enjoys going to the zoo to come with me to the San Diego Zoo and / or Safari Park (they are two different locations). I have a dual membership that allows me to bring one person for free to both places. I'd like to go sometime this week / weekend. It's best if you can drive. 

I'm educated, employed professional, non-smoker, non-drug user, funny, cute, charismatic, outgoing, and pretty awesome! :-)

When you respond, please let me know a bit about you, your hobbies, and a pic. Oh, and any questions you have. I look forward to exploring the Zoo with you!

Recently I realized I want a career in law enforcement... :) Its so discouraging when I have friends or current co-workers ask about what I want in the future, I tell them that I'm working on getting into shape to go to the police academy and if I'm not getting a dirty look, I get a one word responses, or how much they hate this or hate that. I think it's pretty sad to see so many young people not even encouraging others who want to better a community they've been apart of their whole life, to make their world or maybe even their future kid's community a more safe place. Instead I get backlash.



I feel like I should just keep it a secret, but at the same time I'm so proud of myself for getting this far, getting over the intimidation of all the what ifs and working towards something so great. 



I guest I'm just looking for like minded people or a few words of encouragement, its always nice to read some supporting words while I'm working hard towards something so big.

In a nut shell, I'm currently living in VA where I can't find work (in this little town I live in) I'm living with my family, and have no way of making a life for myself. I'm young guy not living life and am just existing from day to day.
I want to branch out and find a better life, find love, and a sense of identity. 
I'm looking to see if there are any generous top guys out there who would be willing to fly me out to LA and help me build a new life. I'm also looking for some kind of relationship, so I'm not gonna use you and loose you, if you get the metaphor.
I'm someone with a lot to offer and of course would be willing to pay you back once I'm back on my feet again.
Sometimes life is lonely and we need help from our fellow man to make changes in our lives, right? 

I would be more than grateful to anyone asking my ad who is willing to help a stranger and make a difference in my life.

Some ads are for people who love dogs, this is for people who love tennis. Who's going to Indian Wells? Bummer about Fed being out. I'm guessing Joker will roll through everyone, but would be nice to see some other people step up. What's the big deal about Sharapova and whatever drug she was taking, she's skinny as a rail. Not that I'll miss her grunting. 

As the ad states, tennis is a big interest to me. Looking for others that enjoy playing and watching tennis. My game is not bad at the moment, probably a 3.5 but can hang with better players, I have skill and the fundamentals down, just need more consistency and practice. 

Looking for light hearted people and interaction.

Well I'm not sure how far I will get with this because for some people it's always about sex and not the actually nature of the ad. So here goes...what's up! I'm looking for a serious workout partner! I do work at a gym and I had some trainers but due to a little financial situation I had to stop, but I still need to hit the gym or just basically exercise on a regular...but it's hard to stay motivated on the real, so I was hoping if I had some one to workout with it would make it easier. I work 3rd shift so ideally someone that would be available in the afternoons or even early evenings or so would be great. If you have to do mornings that will be fine, I will just have to bring my workout clothes along with me. You don't have to be in the best shape of course but at least look as if though you've seen the inside of a gym or weights or something. I have a few workout plans and dvds but to have that push would be great as well. Anyway hit me up if you are interested and tell me your goals as well. If you have a group of friends that would like to join or that you work out with, that would be great since we can all motivate each other. 

Thank you

What's up! I'm looking for a serious workout partner. I do work at a gym and I had some trainers but due to a little financial situation I had to stop, but I still need to hit the gym or just basically exercise on a regular and I need to do it hard...but it's hard to stay motivated on the real, so I was hoping if I had some one to workout with it would make it easier. I do have T25, Insanity, Hip Hop abs etc and that's cool but I get bored easily and I want to lift some weights as well. Like I stated before I work for a gym. 24 hour fitness to be exact. I'm trying to lose 20 lbs or so and we can help support each other. I'm putting this into the strictly platonic section because my priority is to get a workout partner. I am not looking for sex or anything of that nature for real. It would help if you do have a membership at a 24 hour fitness and is somewhat fit or active/athletic. 

Email me if you are interested and tell me about yourself.

Im like your regular joe, but to the trained eye you can tell I am into guys or just a real shy nice guy. but gay guys and girls always describe me as a conservative, assertive, cute, nice, funny, friendly, but my downfall is I dont put myself out there even though I have been looking for a while now.

I would love to first be friends. How quick we move forward is up to the chemistry.

I am out to my family, they support me and have no issues with my orientation. Im in school for a degree in psychology. I was an English major in HS. And last year I wanted to major in math rather than Psych. cuz I'm pretty good at math too. But I now realized counseling is my true calling.

Music is a tricky topic so I am not getting into that, ok, man?

Umm, ok. Well, looking forward to hear from you. 

Email? Texts? . . . Calls?

Hi, 

I'm the weirdest person you'll meet or you may 'get' me a little and then you'll maybe know more later on because I'm not shy at all but I'm quiet a lot of the time. 

I want to stay with someone who is positive, healthy, happy and peaceful. Non-judgemental is the only way because I'm not comfortable around people who have ideas about the way things 'should' be. I'm 28, Caucasian, tattooed, fit and healthy. I don't do drugs, smoke, drink. If you smoke 420 it's not an issue unless it's common. I like balance in an environment. 

Okay so you're probably wondering what I want and why I think it'll work out. I like adventures and experiences because I am studying runes (an ancient alphabet) while traveling randomly and meeting people of all sorts. It's like my own hobbit journey sort of, an epic journey. It's dangerous on craigslist doing this, and lots of people have told me I'm really crazy or they feel bad for me. I like what I'm doing and I'm very, very happy. 

If you have extra room and wouldn't mind having me around I would love to stay with you for a week. I have no money and I'll provide my own food of course and toiletries. 

I meditate in the mornings and study. After I go out into nature or do an odd job. Some times depending on where I'm staying I meet with friends who share similar interests. 

If you aren't spiritual or you think what I do isn't real or worth my time, it's okay. I know exactly what my goals are. Please please please don't assume I'm in trouble, need advice, a job, or anything. If you WANT to shelter a stranger for a week, awesome. 

Please be under 35.

30 yo female here interested in meeting someone who has been able to overcome hardship and finds interest in guiding others who don't have a support system! I believe I would benefit from a relationship where I can share my thoughts and feelings without being judged. My hobbies include going to museums, shooting ranges, improving my shoddy pool skills, karaoke, watching foreign films, dramas and comedies. I also really want to learn how to drive stick shift and a motorcycle. If you're up to meet a down to earth easy going gal that would be entirely grateful for your time, I'm it. We can start by shooting emails and see where it goes. LA can be a lonely place and it would be nice to meet someone who gets it. Looking forward to speaking with a sensitive, open minded individual that sees the beauty in vulnerability and is not out there to exploit it. If any of this seems appealing to you, I look forward to talking. Please respond with a photo.

Just relocated to CA from CT. Looking to explore all the fun things to do here.. Like I said looking for a hang out buddy. Doesn't matter what or who you are. Just be you. Man/women/straight/gay/trans/black/white/tan. No judgment here, just don't be an asshole.

Now I said I have no judgment, that doesn't mean other people don't. Now I'm short, fat (fluffy) and not the best thing to look at. Now the reason I state these facts is that ""I LIKE ME, just the way I am"" So if you have a problem being with someone like me, please don't bother. I don't need health tips. I have psoriasis, I don't want to know how you, your mothers uncle, you friends BFF just suddenly got then found a cure, and give me a shit ton of advice and meds to take to cure it. There is no cure...

I try always to be positive , I'm very eclectic in my likes in music, movies, books. I love Comic cons, book cons, casinos, concerts. The beach, walks, working out. Finding little book stores and cafes. Love my Zelda, Mario, D3. And when I get another comp WOW and Rift. Yes I am a geek and nerd.

Those are the only ""Labels"" I will give myself.

I am not looking for sex. Jeesh I can do that on my own. Just friends, hang out buddies, bitches that are in the know. Lol

I do have some deal breakers. Lies.....Smoking, I don't, also don't like the smell, there's no smoking in my car, home. I will not tolerate hate, racism, religious fanatics, closed minds.

Lie one time, we're done. Rather have the truth, even if its painful, than a lie

Um I guess that's it for now. Lol

Good day, hope your doing well and thank you for opening my ad. Am a 28 year old Latino looking for a female friend who is more into the nerd lifestyle of reading comics, watching movies, reading and going out to explore new places. I generally like going to the movies if I can find someone who can go with me, hint hint. I just discovered the New Beverly and love their double features, also trying to find new movie theatre like the new bev. One of my other nerdy pleasures is going to the comic shops to pick up the titles am reading and looking for new figures to add to my collection, but I rather go to Frank and Sons if am a pick up toys. Tv? Well I love the Simpsons, still my favorite to this day, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, True Detective, King of the Hill, and a bunch of old shows. Ok, lastly I also enjoy classic rock, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Queen, Rolling Stones etc.. But also enjoy other genres. And just as a final, just to take it out the way, I am aware that sometimes attractions are a bit strong and People bump uglies lol and not oppose to that, but only if it keeps the main thing which is the chemistry of having fun and enjoying each other's company without the physical aspect. Well hope your into some of the things am into, and if your not, it's cool, maybe we can learn something new from each other.

So I'm not sure what I'm looking for at the moment. It would be great to maybe just trade some emails and chat a bit. It's been an odd night already.

And with no expectations, chat, talk, get a drink, all sound interesting to me..


Sorry to be so cryptic, don't mean to be. I'm a guy in his 40's with a good sense of humor (about myself mostly) who works a lot, but tries to enjoy my time off. I'm white, tall, slim, easy going guy who has his moments (take that as you will) and can always keep the conversation going. Really, I'm just trying something different, because that's been the theme so far tonight..

Hi There,

Looking to cuddle today?

Maybe you're over the whole dating scene and have too busy of a schedule to get into a serious relationship? Or maybe you just want to try something new?

I'm Lee and I'd love to be your cuddle buddy for the day. I have been told that I'm a good listener and have a flexible body too. Other traits about me are that I'm 30, 5'10, 140 pounds, disease-free, and have caramel cappuccino complexion. I'm also a massage therapist by day so I can give good body rubs!

Please host and choose a spot where we can cuddle. Feel free to talk about anything you want as we feel and hold each other. I also have some nice spa music on my phone that can help set the mood. Remember this is a strictly platonic cuddle session, so nothing sexual. Please be kind and respectful of that, thanks!

If interested, please contact for rates.

Thank you.

Warm Regards,

Lee

I'm looking for someone who wants to help me dress up and be a sissy. I want to learn how to look, and act, sexy with some lingerie and stockings that I bought. 

I'm a fairly masculine guy, but I'm turned on by the idea of being sub and learning how to please and be feminine. I'm willing to be taught by a guy who knows what men want, or by a girl who'll help me play the part well. 

I'm 35, an athlete and in great shape. Good looking, white, hung 8. Ideally looking for someone I can dress up for discreetly and spend some time being a sissy, maybe go shopping together and come home to try things on over drinks?

Please be discreet, straight and have experience with this.

Hello,
I am seeking a fun lady or two who would like to chill with me and my husband this Saturday. Not in a plot to sex you but I have fun with my husband, go figure. We can hit a few bars up or go see a local act. If the energy is right I mind you coming over to my apartment. We can play music, play board games, play cards, take shots, smoke lol. Im a big kid and i just want to relax and have a good time. I work hard : ( 

Again I'm not looking for a threesome. I enjoy the presence of beautiful women. I want a friend that i can just be comfortable with. Someone sexy who will dance with me and wont mind when I grab her titties lol. My husband is hands off with other women but still an exciting guy to have around. He's usually the life of the party until I warm up. Sometimes I'm not the best at breaking the ice.

You:
WOMAN - can voice verify
mobile
420 friendly
Chill vibes
Single
Not expecting sex
willing to laugh and have a good evening 

If any of this sounds like a good time feel free to reply with a few pics and tell me something cool : )

Hello,

I hope as you come across this your day is going well. I am a young 25 year old straight male looking for a workout partner. I'm in decent shape but I'm really dedicated to stepping my fitness up a level. I need a cool person to workout with pretty regularly (3-5 days a week) and we can help keep each other honest and accountable. I would prefer someone who lives near West Covina and is younger or in great shape if an older age. 

I want to be clear I'm not looking for anything sexual. Just a workout partner and maybe friend if we click that way. I am 4/20 friendly but we don't need to go there because I mostly want a cool friend to workout with. I would love for us to have fun and enjoy working out. It doesn't have to be a daunting torturous activity.

Thanks for reading :-)

I moved to Beverly Hills back in September and haven't really had much opportunity to socialize. So basically I have no friends out here.

I'm looking for a girl around my age who is drama-free, fun to talk to and hang out with, and doesn't want to do a ton of things. By this, I mean stuff like hiking or going to museums. I don't want a friendship where we have to go do a bunch of stuff. I want one where we just genuinely enjoy each other's company and can just sit around and talk or drink or something. Laid back.

Hopefully someone responds to this, I'm super bored.

Not posting for anything in particular. Some good conversation would be cool. Some healthy flirting would be too.

I'm an unconventional conventional guy. Has a eye for older women, likes them thick, but looking for conversation to keep the boredom at bay. Not looking for anything to happen, but who knows, could be fun if something did. Just saying. 

Into all kinds of things, you be too. Drop me a note and lets exchange a few emails. Pen-pal like :)

hello cl
never did i think i would be turning to this site to find friends but with my work schedule it is kind of hard to go out and make friends. not that it isnt hard enough to make friends nowadays with everyone always being on their phones/tablets/laptops.
all im looking for in FRIENDS, like the title says. we can email, kik, text (maybe), and maybe even hang out at some point. lets see where it goes.
i am 26, love listening to music, i love art (even though i cant draw for shit), sports, 420 friendly, drama free, single, no kids. i do work im not looking for handouts, i have a college degree and i have my own car. for those of you who care what a person looks like i am a bit on the bigger side.

please do not reply asking for a picture in your first email, if looks is what you are worried about move on because im not interested, we can trade pictures eventually
and also do not ask me to hang out on your very first message and then get butt hurt when i say no, if you made it this far into my ad you have read what i am looking for 

to make sure you are real, reply with your age on the subject line

Hello, 

I'm Biracial, bearded tall guy. Big, strong athletic build. I work a lot and have a crazy schedule, and I also go to school. 

I'm looking for a special woman that really would like to engage in a relationship based around adult nursing. Now I know that to some women this might seem like code for foreplay or just trying to disguise real intentions. In effort to put those concerns to rest, I will describe what I think ANR is. To me, ANR is the connection and intimate bond with a nurturing woman that goes beyond sex and is more intimate and emotional than it is physical.

I really love the bond created with a woman when engaging in nursing. It's exciting, tender and lovely. I'm a big, strong man and I'm looking for a woman that has a need to nurture and wants a man needs to takeoff the tough exterior with her, get to know each other, have good meaningful conversation, and then engage in long suckling sessions. Theres no need to be experienced. Although, suckling and the act of nursing can be quite sexual, I strongly prefer that we don't take it any farther than that.


I really don't care about so much about your appearance, personality is what I care about. Please be hygienic and clean. I don't discriminate! breast size doesn't matter, age, neither does body type (skinny, bbw or ssbbw is all great). Although, I would prefer a middle-aged woman, I understand matureness is a mindset not a number. I will surprise you with how mature and respectful I am. I am mobile and can come to you. 

Please reply if you think we could really develop a great relationship. Thanks.

Hi ladies 👋😊,

I'm 22 years old looking for an awesome friend 👌. I live in Tampa, FL and I'm planning on moving back to LA on June. So I'm needing a friend to be my rock, while I start a new life. I'm into fashion and adventure 😊. I have my own car but no place to stay or a job which is my biggest concern 😞. Starting a new life is not easy, and you would have to be that awesome to help me 😁. If you are that friend, I will owe you big time! Which I would have to make up for it, once I get back on my feet. I'm loyal, open minded, and can be direct. But one thing for sure I'm always there for my friends 👌. I'm looking for someone who knows what they want, someone close to my age, fun, loyal, real, and spontaneous. I'm also trying to learn Spanish. So if you know how to speak Spanish fluently, you could be my teacher 😜.

I'm a guy and I have many computer skills, from troubleshooting and fixing to doing such applications as Photoshop, Quark Xpress, Acrobat, and various others. I am very knowledgeable about Macs, but I also know about Windows. I can troubleshoot and fix your computer, or set it up, or ... Maybe you would like me to take you up to Windows 10?

I'll trade my skills for the opportunity to have you sit on my face and make me lick and suck you silly. Nothing more than facesitting is required for the trade, but if you want more, which is strictly up to you, I'm at your service.

This is intended as a nice, friendly, easygoing exchange and a nice benefit for you.

Good morning CL community,

I'm in search of meeting someone that wants to engage in a longterm FWB situation built upon more than just sex. I feel the same way as many woman on this site where that sex only is not a fulfilling endeavor.

Ideally, we would become friends that enjoy talking with each other, meeting up outside of the bedroom, and genuinely enjoying each other's company.

Not looking for any commitment etc. Just an opportunity and experience to connect with someone on the same wave length.

Single, attached - I'm open to either. No judgments. Your life and choices are yours.

I'll share a photo with you if you're interested and we'll go from there. 

Jack

Hello Ladies,
I'm not sure where to start. I'm hoping that I can find someone real who is going through a rough or boring relationship just as I have with someone who turned out to be to much of an opposite and just fake . I'm a very laid back outgoing person who is a total movie and music fanatic. I'm open to talking to anyone who wants someone to confided in or workout with if you live in the area or close by. I have a ton of interest outside of the few I've already mentioned. I truly just want someone I can be honest with who is nonjudgmental and open minded just as I am, and hopefully we can be really great friends or possibly more if it is meant to happen.

Just to give an idea of who I would hope to meet. A woman who likes some or all of the things listed below.
1. Tattoos 
2. Horror Movies 
3. Sci-fi/Comic book movies or TV shows 
4. MMA or any form of Martial Arts
5. Working out 
6. Variety of Movies and Music
7. Cars ( Imports or Muscle )
8. Trying new things 
9. All kinds of Foods and able to cook
10. The outdoors ( hiking, horseback riding, camping etc...)
11. Traveling
12. Thrill rides
13. Going out dancing
14. Movie nights 
15. Holidays
16. Enjoying life
17. Hard working 

This should give you an idea of who I am. I hope to meet this special person. When you reply put your favorite hobby in the subject line so I know your real.

I want to get to know more people and see where it goes :-) I want to be able to express myself and be as quirky and eccentric without having to hide anything. I am sarcastic most of the time haha, I love to laugh and if you know any bad puns I'm sure I'll laugh at them regardless haha. I'm pretty easy going, shy at first but once I open up I won't be able to shut up. Haha. I love to do many things/ have many interests. Whether it's exploring the city or hiking in the mountains. Concerts are always a blast, going to museums etc. Going to the movies as well. I'm up for anything really. The list goes on~ If we end up getting along and becoming friends that would be great.

Thanks for reading!

Maybe I'm posting in the wrong section, but when I posted on m4w, I received all sorts of pros propositioning me; not close to what I'm looking for. 

Unfortunately relationships are not perfect, nor am I. We have been together 25 years, deeply care, respect one another and not looking to change anything in my home life-nor anyone else's. The sad truth is, the sensual-sexual spark-is no longer what it once was; and I so miss it. If you're a woman, who unfortunately is experiencing the same/similar, than you can understand, and if you would be interested-open in exchanging a few emails and chat, see what happens, I'd like to hear from you. 

About me: race: Caucasian, body: average, height: 5'11"", weight: 210lbs, age: 52-married, education: college grad, employed: prof in banking/fin sector. Availability: week-day mornings before noon.

Ideally I'd like to find-meet a safe, down to earth woman, close to my age, that like me understands discretion, respectful of our private life's, limited to no expectations and with no ulterior motive other than, if we connect, we meet when schedules permit and is able to do so week-day mornings-normally from Nine am to Noon! I also need you to be hiv-, d/d free, no drama, a non-smoker for a safe, discreet FWB type of friendship; if it get to this. I prefer to exchange a couple of emails, that eventually leads to a platonic meeting for morning coffee, as we get to know one-another; if we connect I'd like more. If like me your missing what I'm missing and this resonates with you, lets chat. . .tell me about you, or anything you are comfortable talking about. Please, to avoid spam/bots, place the color of your eyes and location city on the subject line. I don't need a pic, but if you desire a pic it shall be Pic4Pic or a coffee meet!

So I haven't been out in years, I'm 29, never been married and don't have any kids. I've been fighting depression for as long as I can remember. I have finally got tired of the same thing over and over not doing anything about it. I would say I'm socially awkward but am able not to make an ass out myself. I'm looking for anyone that wants to go out and do normal things and meet new people. I don't care about looks (im not bad looking if that scares you off), all I care about is that we are able to break out of our wretched norm and be temporarily happy if that makes any sense. I would like to have a normal social life if it kills me cause i know that depression is doing a good job taking care of that. So if there is anyone out there going through the same thing or just wanna go out and have a couple of laughs maybe even go to the gym (i have an LA fitness membership) and set goals for accountability that would be fucken great. Even if it is once a month or whatever its better than nothing. Ok i fugured that I would stop here since it seems like I'm begging but what else can I do?

so the honest truth to begin this ad with is that I am married. I am NOT unhappily married nor is my marriage in any way difficult. I'm just looking for something more. I guess you can say I want something exciting and the idea of an affair has always excited me. In the end I think it's in our human nature to always want more than what we have. Or in other words sometimes we are just selfish. 

so I would enjoy having an affair with a woman who maybe finds herself in the same situation as I do or someone who just find the idea of being with a married man exciting. As far as age is concerned I would prefer someone between the ages of 20 thru 32. anyway hope to hear from you.

I am a boomer male looking for a boomer female or traditional m/f boomer couple for a platonic relationship that will last 30 minutes then morph into whatever 2 or 3 consenting adults can come up with. 

Maybe we can play some disrobing poker. Or if we feel spiritual, we can visit St. Sealy's of Posturepedic and enjoy the sermon on the mount. Or we can do some provocative and teasing dance steps. Or trumping everything, we can debate each other and show off our oral skills. Or mutually prove our manual dexterity in gratifying each other. Or we could do nothing but sit around in our birthday suits. There is so much we can do!!! Then, when we are done, worn out and totally spent, we can do what other boomers in this country do: cuddle up and take a nap.

I am hwp, clean, ddf, respectful, a gentleman and fun to be around. I am totally straight; not bi, not curious, not interested in crossing swords or taking part in dueling pee streams. I am fine with being around other males, but no contact.

My massage session is deep tissue (where needed) and Swedish with a sensual touch. It is from head to toe. I am someone with personality and you will be very comfortable with me. There won't be any awkwardness. When we meet, it'll be as if we've been friends. 

Hiring someone like me (a male) is the best way to fulfill that curiosity. You won't feel guilty or scared because you are getting a LEGIT massage. You have full control of your comfort level. I am a professional who knows how you feel. I can help your curiosity. I am also discreet. 

I am Asian American, easy on the eye, 5'6"", 120 pounds. Clean shaven, educated. 

My session is either incall or outcall (within 5 miles)
I offer 60 or 90 minutes. 

When you email me, please tell me a little bit about yourself, your wants and such.
Sometimes my posting get flagged before i get to reply to you, so if you are serious, include your direct email in the email.

Hi, I have a 24 hour fitness membership and I was hoping to find a buddy that has one too. I live a few minutes away from the place so I will try to go daily. Hopefully you could pick me up and take me to the place, but I can always just walk and meet you there. My preferred time to go would be from 12am-6am so it would be empty. All I ask is that you go daily or often too. Send a pic of your face pic and a description like your level of fitness. I would consider myself a beginner so don't expect a me to be buff or have a high endurance. If you can't go during the time that I chose let me know. I just prefer that time, but I will make exceptions for you if you really can't make it.

If you aren't willing to trade face pics, don't bother messaging. This is for platonic gym buddy only, nothing more. If you ask me for nudes or ask if I am gay/bi I will delete your message.

I am married hence the discretion, it's a complicated situation that I am willing to talk about. I basically never have sex and don't particularly just want to meet random women when I could have a connection with a cool person who I actually like. I'm into music, movies and comic books. Pretty easy to talk and always up for a good laugh. I've never posted on here before but thought it might be worth a shot. Would love to hear from you. Respond with a pic and I will send one back.

If you are in the position to easily change someone else's life by giving them a bit of what you have (that you aren't using, that isn't going to change your daily life whether you give it away or not), I ask that you kindly consider giving money to this young individual.

My goal is to acquire two million dollars. I have no interest in selling a product, being part of any business deals, or being invested in. I'm looking only for people willing to give and want nothing in return. 

I'm not asking for pity nor am I trying to emotionally guilt anyone. There's no obligation of any kind to give me anything. I'm simply throwing this out there to see if anyone would answer my plea. After all, it doesn't hurt to ask, does it? I, like everyone else, am in need of financial assistance, and not the kind that loans provide. Loans do nothing but enslave people. 

I seek a gift the way a young person would ask their elder family members, except it happens that I don't have anyone of that kind in my family or social circle. One day if I do become financially successful, I would like to be that individual in the family who gives to everyone else, though.

I'm not asking for money because I am poor nor am I asking because I am sick. I'm asking because I like to take risks and I like what Lady Luck has to offer me. 

I am employed and I have a college degree. I'm intelligent and I don't have mental health issues. I'm just trying to get ahead in life in our debt-ridden society which sells you the lie that if you work your hardest and do your best you will get places. The cold hard truth is that money is wealth and wealth is power. That being said, money runs the world and money will get you places. 

While I have little interest in power, I am interested in financial freedom, so please think of your gift as buying a slave their freedom. 

Thank you for your time in reading this. I know time is money and its precious.

I have a lot of stamina, but I'll tone it down for the right person hahah. Also, if by any chance you also have a 24 hour gym membership, we can also go there and exercise, not necessarily together but just show up there together or meet there and do our own thing or whatever.
With all this being said, I really have no expectations of anything developing other than friendship/companionship. I dont really care if you have a boyfriend/husband whatever, just be cool and respectful and ill do the same in return.

Hi,

I'm an Asian male, 30, 5'10, 140 pounds, fit and healthy. Just looking to make a new female friend.

The ideal friend would be generous, kind, adventurous, skinny, healthy and fit also. I'm also a vegetarian, do yoga, and into personal growth so bonus if you are into any of these things.

I love anime culture, video games and I give massages for my job. Maybe you'd like one too?

We can hang out in my room or at the studio, which ever one works better for you!

Hope to meet you.

Warm Regards,

Lee

I'm looking for a chill female to chat with and maybe kick it with I like all music. But bluegrass and trap. I like video games I enjoy writing music cooking baking and all around having fun at first I'm pretty quiet and nervous because I have a dark sense of humor. The friendship is strictly platonic. I have trouble making conversation. Please put CL in the subject.

Hi,
I'm looking for a life long friend, and someone who can be like family to me. It's something that's important to me. We all need emotional support and others to be able to lean on. Someone to talk to when we are in need, and be there for them as well. I don't have a support system ( friends or family ) and it's something that I want. I'm a very nice, caring, respectful, shy, and loyal type of person. I don't lie and I expect the same from you. Please reply if you are serious about this. I really want this, and I take you seriously if you tell me that you want the same as well... I really want to be able to care for friends like family, and have the same in return. After I get to know you of course. Please know that this is for platonic only. 

Some of my interests: I LOVE my video games!!!! 😋🎮 I love drawing and Art. I like walking to places, exercising, listening to a talk show, listening to music, reading, learning new things, cooking and baking GREAT food, and watching TV shows. 

Some music of my interests are: Punk, Alternative, Rock, Grunge, Metal, some Rap, and others. Most of the music I like is from the 70s-2005, because most new music now a days is crap. 

I believe that common interests help a foundation for friendships. So we have much to talk about. Knowing our childhood interests help us to reminisce over the past. A few things that I loved as a child are Sonic The Hedgehog cartoons and of course video game, Mario cartoon and Video game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Batman, and SEVERAL other cartoons. I read RL Stien books and watched the Goosebumps show as a kid. I really loved it as a kid. I watched a lot of movies and shows as a child. I as well loved reading comics. Many aspects of me haven't changed. I still love my video games and watching some cartoons and Anime. But we are adults, and I deal with the crappy responsibilities as well of course. 

In case your wondering of my console platforms: I have an Xbox One, PS3 and PS4, Wii (Waiting for the NX ), PSVita, 3DS, and Steam. I'm usually on my Xbox One in the evening. 

Thank you for reading this. I appreciate it greatly! 😋💕

Ps. Please say something more than hi. 😬

Looking for a white male that love spoiling women,who really wants to be in a long term relationship with a black woman. It would be great if you have dated a black woman long term in the past. I am very attracted to white men and have dated outside my race most of my life so I am comfortable doing so. Not sure what my chances are of finding what I seek here. I am a college student and I know what I want. I am very active, love the outdoors shopping, travel, reading, exercise-running, yoga, weight lifting. I am brown in complexion, brown eyes, smooth skin, black hair, over 5 ft, attractive in body and still working on it, cute face, beautiful white teeth. A neat freak, always well dressed, and can cook like pro. Love being intimate with my guy and showing affection in private and tastefully in public as well. I don't really pay attention to what others think when it comes to my preference in men.

Looking for a straight or discretely bisexual guy. Someone around my age that's masculine, mature, nice... Let's talk, meet, and hangout. Open to friendship and more if it goes there, but no expectations.
A little about me: I'm 32, masculine, discretely bisexual, virgin, no std's, 5'11 275, hispanic-american, average looks but a bit on the heavy side (though getting healthier). I like movies, tv, music, hiking, working out, comics, museums, the beach, good convo, stargazing, long drives, playing cards, board games, eating out... anything laid back really.
Im pretty much inexperienced and shy sexually, but for the sake of compatability: I fantasize about stroking a guy or giving oral. I'm more on the submissive side, so if you have a dominant personality, we're probably a better match. If you'd like to chat or want to know more, drop me a line.

You're the one I have been looking for, you heard my call in that place called, ""the collective consciousness in that space where time doesn't exist,"" we existed before we were. I can't wait to close my eyes so I can see you again and take you into my arms. Your age is the last thing I worry about; your looks are seen by those that don't look with their hearts. How is it that I see you as only I could, will you see me too or will you see me with your eyes only.

We all have the ability to love many times over just as deep, just as meaningful and just as the very first time. Don't let your heart harden just because its broken and in pieces, if you do how in the world will you meet the next love of your life? When my heart is broken by someone I pick up the pieces and use my tears to glue it back together. This will not stop me from search for you, I know you will probably break it again but that will never stop me from wanting you, time and time again.

This body is older, my hair has some grey and my mind remain in my teen's, where I first saw you sitting alone on a bench waiting for the bus. You boarded, my heart stopped, my breath quickened and my stomach felt as if millions of bee's inside were stinging me. Will you write back and tell me you that you were looking for me too. 

I don't care if your taken in this life time, just let me be a part of your life, if only minutes at a time or behind closed doors.

I am a pretty laid back and chill person who is looking for a lifelong friend. I am 24 and black. I would really love to find someone who loves to try new things and is into travel. I am not really girly but I love doing my nails and shopping. Nothing too crazy! I enjoy listening to hip hop and r&b therefore if you enjoy that music then we can go to concerts. I am not looking for someone who I can hang out with every once in awhile, I am looking for someone that I can eventually call a good friend. I believe balance is key, therefore, I am not interested in being the person you hang out with because your boyfriend is busy, etc. I am a respectful, considerate and open-minded person. If we click, then you will gain an amazing friend in me and I hope I can gain the same in return. If you decide to reach out please let me know if you like Bryson tiller :) Also, I live in Long Beach, so please at least be in la county.

Hi, I am rehabbing from a recent knee operation and am strictly prohibited from participating in any form of physical fun. Or....I think that's what the doc said. I don't like doctors, but they are a necessary evil in life. Anyway, my life currently consists of Physical therapy, healthy food (at least I get lots of protein), mindless TV, and attempts at sleep.

Sooooo, I thought it might be fun to meet a new fellow human or two. I'm not looking for sex, no FWB, no LTR, just someone to talk with. I don't want to meet or exchange pics....nope, just talk, text, email. It might break the monotony for me. Please ladies, help a guy out here.

OK, the details; I am 55, 6'-1"" tall, 185 lb, white guy. I own a business in Valencia. It would be helpful if you are close to my age, or want to learn about the aches and pains, pleasures and desires, dreams and goals of someone in my shoes. I am divorced and content with my status....at least for now. I am not religious, but willing to broach the subject. Can't stand Donald Trump, so if he's your guy, sparks might fly if we hit politics.

Let me tell you about real men, not immature little boys you know or think you love...

A man that can really love you is a man that will not only tell you, but show you. A man that would love to spend time with you to hear about your day. A man that would love to be the one you think about, and when you do, you get butterflies. A man that when he thinks of you, you make him feel like he can fly. A man who thinks that you are gods gift, not because you are beautiful, but because god created all woman as the most amazing creatures on earth! When I think about the perfect woman for me, I think about your sexy smile and those gorgeous eyes he gave you, so I can get lost in them when we talk face to face. When I think of you, I get butterflies myself, anxious to see you. When I think about you my heart races and I get a cool-aid smile from ear to ear. When I think of you, I'm, not like every other guy that just wants to get between your legs, I want to get in your head. A real man knows that if you seduce a girls mind, her body will follow. And that's when the best sex will come, because she's into it. A real man knows that a woman should be respected, not because his mother instilled those values in him, but because she deserves nothing less. A real man wants to hold you tightly and kiss you gently. Kisses on the forehead, and on your cheeks and loves to whisper sweet nothings in your ear, not because she wants to hear it, but because you bring it out of him. A real man knows its the little things that count, like a random text saying, "" just wanted to let you know that im thinking about you, and cant wait to see you or talk to you later"", or every morning text her, "" I hope you have a good day! "" A real man will open doors, and walk with you hand in hand, because you make him feel like he can and will protect you, because you are his princess or queen. A real man will compromise with you, because he wants to make you happy, and in doing so, you will want o make your man happy and compromise with him. A real man know, being with you shouldn't take a lot of work, being with you is simple if he pays attention to what you are saying, and respects you as the gentle creature god made you to be. He knows that you aren't like him at all and he wants to learn what makes you tick. Why you do the things you do. A real man knows that men think in practical ways and women think with their hearts, and sometimes because of that, it gets her in trouble. A real man never stops trying to show a woman how much she means to him, ever! A real man will be your strength when you need someone to be there for you in your time of need, and never judge you or belittle you because you may have made a mistake. A real man will be there to wipe away your tears when you feel like you are going crazy or breaking apart. A real man knows, that he is nothing without you, and everything because of you. A real man knows that without you, he is only half the man he can be, and Only with you, he is whole...

Lastly, I will leave you with this. Its a short poem I came across about 2 years ago and ill never forget it. As a matter of fact, I've memorized it, so I can tell it to my princess as she grows up ( Yes, I'm a single daddy ) ....

"" The woman came out of a man's rib, not from his feet to be walked on, and not from his head to be superior, but from his side to be equal, Under the arm to be protected, and next to the heart to be loved ""

I know it won't last, but I'm glad the cool weather is back. What I'm hating is that I don't have someone to cuddle up with. I'm not expecting to get laid or anything like that, but I miss the intimacy of having someone to hold. I'm thinking some wine, a good movie, or good conversation just sounds great to go with it.

Let's meet up and have dinner, talk and get to know each other, and if we're both comfortable with it, get a little closer. I'm a 42 year old, tall, slender, attractive white man, clean cut with light features. I do have pictures to share and hope you do as well. You'll find me to be intelligent, funny, kind, respectful, honest, and a lot of fun to hang around with. I have a job I love, great family and friends, and a nice place in Burbank where I live alone. I've just found it's been a little lonely lately.

If you're interested, write to me and feel free to ask whatever you'd like. Please tell me a little about you as well.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Hello. I'm a 47y/o, single, white male, 5'-10"", 155#, dark hair/brown eyes, non-smoker and no drugs, etc. I'm a closeted bisexual with little all-male experience and very discrete. For the last several years I've entertained my ""bi"" curiosities by looking at gay porn. Recently, I've become curious as to what it would be like to expose that part of me to a discrete fetish-friendly woman, as well as what it would feel like to be aroused by gay porn with a woman watching.

Perhaps you're a woman who loves gay porn and the idea of watching two men, but keep it secret. If you're open to exploring this type of interest...I welcome a reply.

If you're a writer, you know that when a specific moment engulfs you -- you just have to get the thoughts out of your head. For some of us, it's moments of sadness or loneliness, or the pain is so great that you have no choice but to write about it. I've been there ever since I was 12 so I know how it is. At least for me I couldn't go a day without writing. The pain was too deep and writing was my outlet. For the last 5 years or so I stopped writing. I decided I just didn't want to anymore and believe it or not, there wasn't ONE thing that compelled me to write. I played the piano a bit but writing was gone. . ..Until. . .My health was threatened. The possibility of breast cancer entered my life like from out of nowhere. I had to take a bunch of tests but I ended up OK. While this was happening I had to sit at the Thanksgiving table and act like life as usual when for me it wasn't. Then, my son fell after kicking a soccer ball and got really hurt. I don't want to get into all of that but basically like dominoes one thing after another has happened and keeps on happening. What do you think I started doing? Write. I haven't written as much as I would have because of my extenuating circumstances but I started to write again.

Writing heals, we all know this. Sometimes it's not about our pain -- it's constructed into a short story or something like that.

Being 45 I thought this group, would be great for those around my age. We'll have more in common, I think. But again, it's not a ""pre requisite"".

I created a Yahoo Group called ""Writing Heals"" and it would be great if you would join and give it a chance. I mean, what's the worst that can happen? Maybe you can meet some other people who are going through similar situations and this group could be about healing.

The only thing I don't want to do is LIMIT the type of writing share in this group. It could be any genre. I know for me, as a distraction, I dabble in some erotica. Maybe you did too. 

If you have any interest, 

email me at scarletblack0307 @ yahoo . com and I will send you the link to join. 

It would be an honor to get to know you.

Scarlet

I know this is the platonic section, but the m4m section just seems too much. I'm in my fifties. Good shape. Nice guy, i'm told. I've been celibate since my last long term relationship ended 5 yrs ago. Mostly because I've never really had many good sexual experiences and the idea of attempted it with complete strangers seems unsatisfying to me. I still get filled with lust at times. Often. I really miss the touch of a man. I miss warm flesh and hugs. I miss the exchange and the comfort. 
I find myself wondering if it's possible to have a great sexual experience before I'm too old to care. Did I go celibate too soon? I've even considered hiring an escort, but the cold business of it doesn't seem conducive to a good sexual experience, at least for me.
Not sure what I'm asking for here. Maybe just turning my mind upside down and emptying out the spare change. I just needed to say this today. Thanks.

Hi I'm seeking an intelligent woman older than 30 that has a flexible day schedule to share some conversation, day hike, day drink and share the good and the bad going on right now. No expectations other than a nice connection and if you have been around the block you know a good connection when you feel it. Just searching for something new but not sure yet what that might be.

've posted here before but decided to take a break from it for a while.
Before you ask for a pic, I used to post a pic with my ad, but that became a problem. Too many people calling me fake and I got tired of it. So, if this ad catches your attention, message me and you'll eventually get a pic. To be honest, I am a good looking guy. In shape, athletic. Just so ya know. You shallow motherfuckers out there.

I'm back and got some down time today. I figured I'd post an ad on this site full of crazies because, well, I just love to be entertained by all those different types of personalities LA has to offer. I love meeting new people but not murderers or clowns, so if you are one...then...yeah. I don't mean like ignorant people, I mean like literally clowns. With the big nose and paint on their face ya know? Clowns are scary as ****. Just tell me something random about yourself. Anything. Let me go first. 

I hate olives. With a passion. I also hate people who don't clear the time on the microwave after they're done using it. I hate when somebody says ""I have to tell you something"" and you know it's going to be something juicy, then they say ""oh never mind"". I hate when I get in bed and I'm soooo comfortable, then suddenly, someone knocks at the door. I hate when you think you were charging your phone overnight but wake up and find out you didn't connect your phone charger all the way into your phone and have to start your day with your phone at 4%. I hate when people have to constantly grab your arm while they talk to you. Never understood why people do that. I wonder if it's because people usually leave during their conversations...

But I do love more than I hate. For instance, I love animals. One day I will own a red panda. You're like wtf is a red panda? Google it, then come back here. I'm a big fan of giving people high fives. You'd be surprised at how many people have terrible accuracy when giving high fives. It's a skill. So if you write to me, your high five skills better be up to par. I love reaching into the pockets of some pants I haven't worn in a bit and finding money in them. I love chapstick even though I've lost almost every single stick of chapstick I've ever owned. If you've gone through an entire chapstick without losing it, I salute you. I love when a woman smells fruity. I love the feeling of asking someone if they have gum and they actually have some. Let's face it, nobody ever shares their gum. Assholes. I also love when I catch a song I really like on the radio at the beginning of the song instead of like the last ten seconds of it. This probably happens once out of every 10 songs I actually like on the radio, but ohhhh boy do I cherish that one time.

Another thing...

If you do decide to write to me,

- WOMEN ONLY.
- NO MEN. (I'M NOT HOMOPHOIC OR ANYTHING. I THINK MY CAT MIGHT BE GAY ACTUALLY)

- YES I'M REAL. 
- NO CREEPS.
- MUST SEND A PICTURE.

You can either write to me on...

KIK: tacosandbeersss
OR reply to my ad.

Don't be shy people and I'm actually very friendly and I smell good. Don't be a CL killer and don't try to go get me to eat some olives and we'll be just fine. Especially if you like staying in on the weekend, ordering some food and watching movies till like 3 AM.

Godspeed.

-Kai

Are you a foodie?
Do you like to try new places to eat?
Is there a place you have allays wanted to try, but haven't?
Have you ever eaten a bug or a grub, or would you try a bug or a grub?
Do you like an ethnic restaurant with a green B in the window?
Do you like an ethnic restaurant where you need a picture menu or a translator to order?
Will you try most (that means most) food items at least once? Yes I have eaten sea cucumber and other weird stuff.
Do you eat shit your friends think is fucking gross?
Do your eating habits make you a poster child for LIPITOR or ZOCOR? 
Do you ever just feel like IN-N-OUT for a burger and fries?
Can you name a ton of great casual places to eat?

If you ask someone if they know a great Mexican place and they answer is; TACO BELL, or great Chinese food and the answer is; PANDA EXPRESS do you say to your self WTF?

If you answered Yes to a majority of the above questions maybe we talk and meet for lunch. I am just looking for someone to meet up for lunch, remember its just lunch nothing more nothing less, nothing ventured nothing gained. And if there is something between us we can have lunch again and again and again and again and anain, I think you get the point.

Seeking platonic friends! My SO knows I'm doing this and is encouraging me to make new friends and explore LA, this is NOT an ad for a fuck buddy, I'm fully satisfied that way! 

If you're up for visiting parks/museums, introducing me to an awesome restaurant (where I pay for my own meal of course!) Or checking out one of LA's many gems. If you have any suggestions or if you're looking for the same thing let's chat! 

Tl;dr looking for friends, not sex. 

One sad but sometimes great l thing is I have an alcohol allergy, so I'm a great DD!!! Although certainly not a babysitter.

I am seeking a female friend who may be interested in a range of activities, from hikes to dancing to travel to visiting cultural institutions, and who can introduce me to new things. Most of my female pals have moved away or are in relationships where there seems to be not enough room for another male. I prefer the company of women and enjoy the special energy and occasional frisson that can exist between the sexes.

Me: I am married, white, tall, masculine, an extremely fit yogi and distance swimmer, well educated and well-traveled, an accomplished architect and visual artist, 56 years young. My passions include most everything in the visual arts, swimming and yoga, long-distance alpine backpacking, travel. 

You: Active, fit, fun, feminine, sensual, a sense of style, smart and curious, particular, young at heart.

And so: Please drop a note about yourself and your passions. Your photo earns mine. Please note that I am seeking a real relationship, not a pen-pal.

Did you know that the word 'avocado' is a made up word? It was made up after the original name of the fruit, 'Aguacate', was discovered to mean 'testicles' in Nahuatl. Evidently households didn't want to be service testicle fruit.

Hey, This older (if a dynamic 60ish puts me in the grave, don't answer, because, wow, I'm dead in spite of the ""dynamism"") Anglo-Saxon beach boy thought a REAL Platonic posting would be good for a few laughs -- and might even be PRODUCTIVE -- but I won't jump to any conclusions because whatever you expect on Craigslist will probably not quite fit what your mind's eye anticipates. 

Yes, I have to start by saying a little about myself -- because you probably would like
a little information: I'm a very healthy guy, obsessively clean, a daily swimmer, 6'2"", 190, non-smoker (NOT FOND OF SMOKE), a sometime gin drinker (not daily) and I can move around fairly easily in most levels of society -- although I haven't yet been
presented at the Danish Court (nor do I aspire to be)..........

I would really like to meet more people who ""enjoy"" or benefit from some of the following personality traits: 

1) KIND, good-natured, curious and informed a bit about the world beyond the subculture of cage fighting (although
that can be interesting for a few minutes); 

2) A player of an instrument or a reader of books (my, how much I expect from people!), a student of foreign languages, possibly a reader of The Economist 

3) A person who would not barf if invited to go to the Getty on
the hill or the classical collection at Malibu -- or possibly the Huntington Gardens -- or a pipe organ concert or the Hollywood Bowl; 

4) A person without intellectual pretensions, because I may be a lot of things, but I'm NO INTELLECTUAL and I'm sufficiently
smart to understand what I'm not; 

5) A guy who might enjoy a little travel up and down the Cali coast in search of a good hike or swim or interesting meal; 

6) And this is not, I know, a ""personality trait"" -- A person who is not so badly out-of-shape that he can't
climb a small hill without huffing and puffing and having a heart attack -- and I'll rapidly add that there are many, many wonderful people who are extremely interesting who have lost their physical vitality, but I'm just hoping to find someone who can also participate
in some adventures that require a fairly decent level of mobility. No, I'm not going to invite you to climb Mt. Hood in January -- primarily because it would kill me; 

7) One more request that might not meet the ""personality trait"" description: Are you fairly presentable in public? Yes, yes, yes --
I know that makes me small and takes me out of the running for being a saint, but my gosh, when the person you're with is getting furtive glances of disapproval or people are fleeing the room -- well, it's just not comfortable -- and I'll be the first to admit that King Kong had many admirable
qualities -- who could be nicer to Faye Raye? -- but green goatees and 14th Century minstrel costumes are sometimes just out of place.................

8) PLEASE -- If you're older an have accumulated some money, have some homes, have lived in a palace, have had the attention of servants and dined with princes -- Well, kiddo', that's great -- great FOR YOU -- but it's meaningless to me. I may have grown up with certain privileges (wow, you mean that doesn't enhance your life? (!!) -- but come on, don't think your ""great past life"" has one thing to do with enjoying the future with new friends. It's TOTALLY irrelevant to me and to almost anyone else with a solid sixth-grade education! I find that a happy, intelligent, kind person who has grown up in a shack can be as delightful as a companion as any crusty old self-satisfied fart who has enjoyed the dubious pleasure of the most exclusive enclaves in The Hamptons. It's true. So wealth, lack of wealth -- and anything it may suggest -- just may be the least of considerations as far as I'm concerned.
I don't think where I've lived or gone to school or traveled will make one little bit of difference to anyone who is seeking good companionship. Got it? I hope so -- because it's important. 

And because I have always felt that bright and friendly people of all ages beyond the most formative have something to offer,
I'm quite open to great companionship from anyone who is, let's say, thirty to ninety (or an emotionally mature person in his twenties) -- Just because I'm not intellectual does not mean I'm a fool -- and I'd certainly rather spend some hours with a joyous and informed seventy year old than a surly, self-centered dude of thirty -- and it works in both directions,
of course. 

Some old farts are intolerable bores and hypercritical. Some seem to think they've totally mastered all knowledge and are ready to tell everyone else exactly how to live. That's both boring -- and intolerable. Some younger people who are accumulating and polishing professional and social skills are delightful, even though they might not possess much more of a storehouse of knowledge than a humble fellow like me. I don't suggest people under thirty aren't great -- but why would I want to bore you senseless with conversation about foreign affairs or language or classical (ugh!) music? Really, I'm too considerate for that. Of course, there are those who are twenty-one and run circles around me musically, linguistically -- and in about every other sense. So I'll leave the stereotypes behind.

I'll mention that I'm not rich and certainly not grubbing around for money -- oh, sorry, Bill Gates says I'm poor. I'm not a tightwad, never have been (maybe that personality trait is seen as desirable by some, but I say, spend a little -- you ain't takin' it with you). It's the older guys who watch every penny that drive me crazy -- come on, go to a nice restaurant, travel to Europe once a year, fix your place up, drive a nice car -- don't leave it all to your ungrateful niece! And as far as younger people who are starting out, well, yes, they need a little help and should be a little more careful....(What was all that about: Just wanted you to know I'm realistic.) 

Anyway, it would be nice if you had a car or lived in the Long Beach-Seal Beach-San Pedro area --- a long drive around this metro area is a nightmare, as you know. If you don't have a car and have access to something like the Blue Line, that's always convenient - and I do go out of my way to be helpful.

Well, I've probably said enough to guarantee that I receive not even one response, but it's been a great exercise in typing! Thanks for reading....... Having gotten through this, you're now primed to begin reading every article in Wikipedia................ Again, my sincere thanks -- and also my sincere assurance that my somewhat irreverent tone should offend nobody........ I just find it hard to be too serious unless circumstances call for it -- and CL should be a joyous place!

I am a Caucasian masculine male, also circumcised and my personal chemistry seeks the same only please. For the record, I'm Jewish.

I seek simplicity so if you are overly discreet that would require much more prying than I'd care to do. There is no reason to go back and forth with what I seek and you should feel the same as I do. If you respond, respond appropriately please. I'd like to see who I am communicating with initially.

Hi I am looking for a jogging partner to jog around the Silverlake reservoir 3 or 4 times a week. You don't have to be in fantastic shape just cute and fun. I like jogging 2 laps around the reservoir at about a 10 minute mile pace. Just looking for someone that will help me 
stay motivated that's all. Thanks for reading this ad.

I am a 45 year old male who is in decent shape. I use to be in amazing shape and would like to get back to where I was. I frequent the park pretty regularly.

I've posted here before but decided to take a break from it for a while.
Before you ask for a pic, I used to post a pic with my ad, but that became a problem. Too many people calling me fake and I got tired of it. So, if this ad catches your attention, message me and you'll eventually get a pic. To be honest, I am a good looking guy. In shape, athletic. Just so ya know. You shallow motherfuckers out there.

I'm back and got some down time today. I figured I'd post an ad on this site full of crazies because, well, I just love to be entertained by all those different types of personalities LA has to offer. I love meeting new people but not murderers or clowns, so if you are one...then...yeah. I don't mean like ignorant people, I mean like literally clowns. With the big nose and paint on their face ya know? Clowns are scary as ****. Just tell me something random about yourself. Anything. Let me go first. 

I hate olives. With a passion. I also hate people who don't clear the time on the microwave after they're done using it. I hate when somebody says ""I have to tell you something"" and you know it's going to be something juicy, then they say ""oh never mind"". I hate when I get in bed and I'm soooo comfortable, then suddenly, someone knocks at the door. I hate when you think you were charging your phone overnight but wake up and find out you didn't connect your phone charger all the way into your phone and have to start your day with your phone at 4%. I hate when people have to constantly grab your arm while they talk to you. Never understood why people do that. I wonder if it's because people usually leave during their conversations...

But I do love more than I hate. For instance, I love animals. One day I will own a red panda. You're like wtf is a red panda? Google it, then come back here. I'm a big fan of giving people high fives. You'd be surprised at how many people have terrible accuracy when giving high fives. It's a skill. So if you write to me, your high five skills better be up to par. I love reaching into the pockets of some pants I haven't worn in a bit and finding money in them. I love chapstick even though I've lost almost every single stick of chapstick I've ever owned. If you've gone through an entire chapstick without losing it, I salute you. I love when a woman smells fruity. I love the feeling of asking someone if they have gum and they actually have some. Let's face it, nobody ever shares their gum. Assholes. I also love when I catch a song I really like on the radio at the beginning of the song instead of like the last ten seconds of it. This probably happens once out of every 10 songs I actually like on the radio, but ohhhh boy do I cherish that one time.

Another thing...

If you do decide to write to me,

- WOMEN ONLY.
- NO MEN. (I'M NOT HOMOPHOIC OR ANYTHING. I THINK MY CAT MIGHT BE GAY ACTUALLY)

- YES I'M REAL. 
- NO CREEPS.
- SEND A PICTURE.

You can either write to me on...

KIK: tacosandbeersss
OR reply to my ad.

Don't be shy people and I'm actually very friendly and I smell good. Don't be a CL killer and don't try to go get me to eat some olives and we'll be just fine. Especially if you like staying in on the weekend, ordering some food and watching movies till like 3 AM.

Godspeed.

-Kai

Hello, this is actually my 1st time using a craiglist's ad, so I'm nervous about the outcome, bare with me. Lol!

My name is Brandon, I'am 23 years old and I live in North Whittier/Avocado Heights. I'am currently unemployed and in bit of a depression/slump right now and fighting it off to get myself back on my feet.

I have no friends within or around the 562 or 626 area, so I'm just looking for friends to hang out, talk, anything.

I'm into bars, food, traveling, video games, movies, art, photography, pretty much down for anything new, but I do have my limits.

I'm friendly, nice, sweet, outgoing, adventurous, funny, well rounded, open minded, and an awesome person from what I have been told.

I do not drive or own a car, that's my only downside.

Well, If you are interested, feel free to message me. I talk to everyone, so don't be shy. Send me an email or simply just KIK me, just let me know who you are and that you're from craigslist.

Hi. I'm Ori. 

I've been scrolling through cl and everyone wants something that seems a bit unattainable. Me, I just want to work. (Say what? A human being that still enjoys making an honest living... Who knew!) So yeah this isn't me looking for friends but more like business acquaintances. If you're living in a positive environment, you'll find my post worth understanding. Even if you don't respond. No harm taken. We're all on here trying to accomplish something.

I'm more like the left hand your right hand has no idea about. (Totally just made that up, use at your own discretion:-]) Need your house or apartment cleaned; email me. Have it done right by someone who deals with mysophobia. You won't be disappointed. Need help around the house just because you don't want to do it; email me. Tired of those kangaroo burgers and unidentified breaded meat chunks? Hungry but can't or don't cook; don't starve yourself, I'll fulfill your appetite. Now I'm no certified Iron Chef but Chef Ramsey can teach me anyday. You eat food made by strangers all the time and they don't wash their hands often, use gloves or worry about cross contamination. Why not have a personal chef to cook how you want to eat? 

If you trust people to do what you want you have to first give them a chance. 

It's 9:12 am. I am not spam or a robot. (In my robot voice) lol. 

Stress free individual. I don't bring negativity, nor do I accept negativity.

This is a non-sexual post. 

Ideally I'd prefer a straight guy or girl who's into the idea of practicing yoga or stretching together, naked. I'm trying to explore being more comfortable in the nude while also gaining more flexibility (I have a desk job, managing a lot of people so my days are stressful so I'm looking for a way to relax and regroup). 

A 1:1 setting would be best but I'm open to a very small group if we are all comfortable. 

I live alone and have a spacious flat. I'm white, fit (ex-athlete) and looking for someone in similar shape/fitness level. 36, 5'10, good looking, normal and very easy going.

I am a boomer male looking for a boomer female or traditional m/f boomer couple for a platonic relationship that will last 30 minutes then morph into whatever 2 or 3 consenting adults can come up with. 

We can play some disrobing poker. Or if we are feeling spiritual, we can visit St. Sealy's of Posturepedic and enjoy the sermon on the mount. Or we can do some provocative and teasing dance steps. Or trumping everything, we can debate each other and show off our oral skills. Or mutually prove our manual dexterity in gratifying each other. Or we could do nothing but sit around in our birthday suits. There is so much we can do!!! Then, when we are done, worn out and totally spent, we can do what other boomers in this country do: cuddle up and take a nap.

I am hwp, clean, ddf, respectful, a gentleman and fun to be around. I am totally straight; not bi, not curious, not interested in crossing swords or taking part in dueling pee streams. I am fine with being around other males, but no contact.

Let's get the friendship going, enjoy one another's company, and have some fun. I'm looking for this Sunday (March 13), anytime between 10:30am and 3pm. Picture is nice, if you are comfortable sending one. I cannot host.

Hi guys, I'm looking to get along with someone who's into casual cuddling with movies/chat sometime. I'm very new to the whole meeting strangers scene, but I've been really curious to meet new people lately and I'm trying to get out of my comfort zone- so if you're curious about possibly hanging, let's chat, see if we have similar interests, and go from there! I believe companionship can just be casual. Sometimes when it's lonely you just want to enjoy someone's company you know? So yeah that's what I'm looking to explore. It doesn't have to be platonic though, we'll just see what clicks for both of us of course, but looking to be friends/get comfortable before trying anything. 

I'm an open-minded, 20/Asian/6'0/200/DDF. I'm REALLY into Pokémon, SmashBros4, Mmorpgs, lots of cooking and baking, horror movies (which I can't watch alone), and ALWAYS trying new places to eat- but feel free to talk to me about anything because I'm an open book! Looking forward to make new friends to chat/explore with. Please be drugs/disease free and hygienic as well. Send your stats and a pic please! Let's go grab a bite or something, ttyl :)

Hi,

I'm just looking for a Caucasian or Hispanic girl who likes the Cheesecake Factory (as well to try new places...and maybe Souplantation lol), but wants company so they can eat in when no one's down to go. I'd like to make a Caucasian or Hispanic female friend because I don't have any female friends and the friends I hang out with are Asian. It's a plus if you're of the said ethnicities with experiences dating Asian. It would be nice to learn from someone's experiences. Just to be clear, we will be doing separate checks since we're not dating. Maybe friendship will lead to that in time, but that seems unlikely though lol I'm looking to meet someone 20-40, easy on the eyes. Just in case. You never know.

If you're homeless and need a shower, some food, a bed to sleep in for a night or two message me. I just want to hang out with somebody, or talk to somebody. I do not do any drugs, except an occasional beer and cigarette.

I enjoy art very much, I like binge watching tele shows, love cartoons. Reading anything about history and philosophy along with myths and legends. My taste for music is classic rock, old blues, opera and classical. I'm a very friendly guy. I'm not, at least I think I'm not ugly. I just don't really leave my house all that much. I guess its a social/crowd anxiety. I don't need a picture of you, if you want one of me than that's fine. If anyone is interested in chatting feel free to message me. I can talk about anything and don't get bored listening/talking with people.

I'm an introverted guy. I'm tall, dark, alright shape -- I'm probably the kind of guy you'd think would go out to bars and pick up girls. I can understand the misconception, but you cannot judge a book by its cover, whether I drive a Mustang or not. 

I was thinking couldn't two people just get together, hang out, and cuddle? Apparently there are already dating type sites already doing this. I just figured hey, wouldn't you like some good company, cuddle, watch a Netflix without the ""chill"" and just feel comfortable with someone? Who would like to try this? 

It may sound odd, but I want you to understand I'm truly serious about this. Nothing more than cuddling. You can email me, find out where I work, my background -- all of that jazz. Just want you to know I'm serious about this. It would be nice. I'm an excellent cuddle buddy and I know you'd enjoy the experience. 

If you're interested in cuddling with me tonight, send me a message. I don't expect you to stay over or anything. If you're a night owl like myself, you can leave whenever you like. We can cuddle, talk about whatever you want to talk about, and just be. Two people holding each other. That's it. 

Probably the least sexual thing posted in personals aside from actual dating, but I want to see who's up to try it. 

Send me a message.

Hi There,

So first of all, I know I'm posting in the ""strictly platonic"" section (and what I'm looking for is ""mostly platonic""). By posting here it's my hope I find the right person to share this with (someone who isn't typically in the ""other"" personals section of craigslist. Lol).

I'm looking for a cute, fun, single and very disease free girl who is, first and foremost, a great friend, but who also loves receiving oral sex and who loves the idea of having a handsome face between her thighs a few times a week. We would definitely hang out. We'd grab drinks, catch a movie and go on adventures together. However, you could also call me during those times when you'd like some oral relaxation and a little late night stress relief.

As for myself I'm 31, completely drug and disease free and single (in all meanings of the word). I just got out of a long term, committed relationship and I'm not ready to start dating again (but I do miss this form of physical intimacy with someone. I've been craving it actually.) I'm extremely playful, talented and I'm looking for something sexually exclusive and ongoing (by keeping things physically exclusive, I feel it keeps things fun and worry free for both people. Hopefully, all of this sounds good to you and you share the same sentiment!).

In the subject heading of your email, please write the phrase you see in the picture above. I look forward to hearing from you, chatting and making plans for drinks to start.

- Tyler

This is a serious post, even if it seems ridiculous I am serious about it. I have always had a fascination on vampires and I believe them to be real. I would like to meet one just so I myself can know that they exist and be able to feel the satisfaction of meeting one, it would be an honor. I've red many books and learned lots of things about them, some a bit to fictional and some that may fit the criteria. If I could just talk to one and ask him/her questions I would be more than happy.

If you have any negative things to say please be kind and don't reply.

Hey girls, 

I understand this may be a totally odd request but here goes nothing! I'm 23 and currently living in San Francisco. I'm looking to move to LA in the next month or so (The sooner the better). Because I'm over 400 miles away, I'm not always able to stop by apartments to take a look and I'm still not all too familiar with LA either.

I'm looking for a Studio apartment or even better, a 1 Bedroom. At least one reserved spot is a must, considering I will have two vehicles with me. I'd love to stay in Hollywood but I'm open to surrounding areas: WeHo, Los Feliz *, Echo Park.. Somewhere centrally located. I want to stay away from the valley as much as possible. I really love Franklin Village and cute areas that are relatively safe. My budget is $1400.. With that, I'd love to have SOME utilities included. Water & Trash mainly. 

Basically, what I'm asking if for someone to help me with my search. I'm constantly on WSR and Craigslist, Apartments.com... Ect looking for places. But some apartments aren't even posted on there. If you have any leads.. Please let me know! If you're down to check places out on the weekends for me and text or email me about it... EVEN BETTER! I'd greatly appreciate it, this transition has been rough! 
Of course I'd also love to make friends so we can grab a bite to eat, hangout, get drinks, whatever! This is all new to me so I'm open to new friends and new opportunities. 

Thanks so much!

I've posted here before but decided to take a break from it for a while.
Before you ask for a pic, I used to post a pic with my ad, but that became a problem. Too many people calling me fake and I got tired of it. So, if this ad catches your attention, message me and you'll eventually get a pic. To be honest, I am a good looking guy. In shape, athletic. Just so ya know. You shallow motherfuckers out there.

I'm back and got some down time today. I figured I'd post an ad on this site full of crazies because, well, I just love to be entertained by all those different types of personalities LA has to offer. I love meeting new people but not murderers or clowns, so if you are one...then...yeah. I don't mean like ignorant people, I mean like literally clowns. With the big nose and paint on their face ya know? Clowns are scary as ****. Just tell me something random about yourself. Anything. Let me go first. 

I hate olives. With a passion. I also hate people who don't clear the time on the microwave after they're done using it. I hate when somebody says ""I have to tell you something"" and you know it's going to be something juicy, then they say ""oh never mind"". I hate when I get in bed and I'm soooo comfortable, then suddenly, someone knocks at the door. I hate when you think you were charging your phone overnight but wake up and find out you didn't connect your phone charger all the way into your phone and have to start your day with your phone at 4%. I hate when people have to constantly grab your arm while they talk to you. Never understood why people do that. I wonder if it's because people usually leave during their conversations...

But I do love more than I hate. For instance, I love animals. One day I will own a red panda. You're like wtf is a red panda? Google it, then come back here. I'm a big fan of giving people high fives. You'd be surprised at how many people have terrible accuracy when giving high fives. It's a skill. So if you write to me, your high five skills better be up to par. I love reaching into the pockets of some pants I haven't worn in a bit and finding money in them. I love chapstick even though I've lost almost every single stick of chapstick I've ever owned. If you've gone through an entire chapstick without losing it, I salute you. I love when a woman smells fruity. I love the feeling of asking someone if they have gum and they actually have some. Let's face it, nobody ever shares their gum. Assholes. I also love when I catch a song I really like on the radio at the beginning of the song instead of like the last ten seconds of it. This probably happens once out of every 10 songs I actually like on the radio, but ohhhh boy do I cherish that one time.

Another thing...

If you do decide to write to me,

- WOMEN ONLY.
- NO MEN. (I'M NOT HOMOPHOIC OR ANYTHING. I THINK MY CAT MIGHT BE GAY ACTUALLY)

- YES I'M REAL. 
- NO CREEPS.
- MUST SEND A PICTURE.

You can either write to me on...

KIK: tacosandbeersss
OR reply to my ad.

Don't be shy people and I'm actually very friendly and I smell good. Don't be a CL killer and don't try to go get me to eat some olives and we'll be just fine. Especially if you like staying in on the weekend, ordering some food and watching movies till like 3 AM.

Godspeed.

-Kai

Finally giving this a try - i am in my mid 30's, happily married with 3 wonderful young kids, only problem is i have a lot of trouble finding nice, normal girls/women to be really close friends with. 

I have a lot of friends, but no true best friend and to be honest it feels like the only thing missing from my life right now. It's hard to quantify but there's just that small difference between being the 3rd wheel in a group of woman getting coffee as opposed to having coffee with a best friend. It's hard to explain and if this doesn't make any sense to you than your likely not the right person. 

My guess is i am looking for a 25 - 40 mom of little ones who feels the same way. Looks don't matter, race, orientation, none of it matters other than you are a good person and we have things in common.

Hope to hear from you if you are looking for the same thing, let me know a little about yourself and we can take it from there. No need to respond if looking for anything else i will just instantly delete.

This is the perfect weather to snuggle and cuddle with a good friend. If you're cute and hot, that's just a nice perk. I'm pretty cute. Or so I'm told. Hehe. Let's cuddle up, snuggle up, share a couch, or ideally strip down to our underwear and share your bed. I've been through a whole lot in the past 12 weeks, and my heart just needs to be surrounded with affection. And I would love a wonderful cuddle session with a nice, sweet, cute friend. I'm in North Hollywood and can travel to you in Burbank, NoHo (especially), Valley Village, Valley Glen, Glendale, even parts of Hollywood, BH, the canyons, or WeHo. Please send a reply with your stats, a photo, (please send a recent face pic for mine). Don't ask me to send my picture if you don't send yours. 

Hope to hear from you soon, buds. 

Absolutely no drugs, no smoking and no alcohol (within reason). Not 420 friendly. 

NoHo and Burbank are the ideal areas and you must host.

My work has been slow lately, so I thought I would try a little social experiment and see if there are any Black Females or Asian Females that might want to exchange e-mails to break up the boredom of our respective days. I don't care whether you are married, divorced, in a relationship or not in a relationship as we will not meet face to face. Here is a wish list in what I am looking for, but obviously you do not have meet every requirement (or any of them really). Intelligent, have your own opinions, polite, adventuresome (or at least adventuresome enough to answer this ad), sense of humor, non-racist, and pretty much just have your life together. So there it is ladies. Are you up to accepting the challenge, or will you just click on the ""back button"" to see what the next lame CL ad might say figuring some other woman will send an e-mail to this clown. But maybe I don't want some other woman's e-mail. Maybe I really want to hear from you. If you read this far, obviously something caught your attention. Yeah, you can admit it to yourself, something did catch your attention. How many of these other ads caught your attention. I'll tell you, none of them. They mostly just disgusted you. So why not do the right thing and hit that reply button. You might make a new friend.

Hi. Thanks in advance for reading my post. Hope it found you well today.

To get to the point, I need a good person in my life. Perhaps, someone who is in the same position and understands the importance of what I am asking for.

Right now, it feels like I am missing someone special because everyone around me is just not getting it. I have a strong personality with a lot of confidence so people use me as a crutch. I have no crutches in my life and sometimes it feels lonely if not scary as well.

I'm a young executive with too much power and not enough experience. My inner circle needs to be upgraded with good people who genuinely care about me and feed me good words/thoughts.

After the foundation of trust is built, it could evolve into something bigger such as being my trusted business partner. Every business needs more than one set of eyes watching it.

I would prefer to start with someone young because I need longevity if this works out. You must also be female. I don't open up to males well. I am a little too alpha male.

I don't expect to find that here but I will sleep better knowing I tried and started somewhere because time is not on my side. That is my excuse for why I am here. . . I work a lot and don't socialize a lot. However, I have a strong personality with a lot of confidence. So if you are a CL nut or troll, bring it on. I like a good laugh here and there.

About me: I am not a broken person with a bunch of baggage or personal issues. Quite the opposite. Allergic to drama. White male in my 30s. Athletic. 5'10""
Best attributes: sense of humor and intelligence.

Again, it may seem like I am asking for a lot but I am not. For right now, I am just asking for a good friend and let nature run its course.

Thanks again for taking the time to read.
Make your day great and smell the roses.

Imagine you are walking by on a busy city street and you see a person in need. They make their need clear and through obvious means, but they aren't bothering anyone.

You are in the position to easily change their life by giving them a bit of what you have, that you aren't using, that isn't going to change your daily life whether you give it away or not. Regardless of how much work you've put in, you aren't going to miss it, since it isn't doing anything sitting in the bank or in a stockpile somewhere.

You aren't giving to them because they are sick or have some kind of defect or because they are poor. This is above that. There's no pity or emotion. This is about giving because you are in the position to do so, and because you can. Nothing more.

You have the power to make a difference in this person's life. The small action of slipping some money into this person's hand has the potential to change their life - a check for an inconsequential amount to you, but possibly more than a lifetime's worth for them. 

By doing so you would leave it to fate to see what happens, with no regrets. This act of kindness (or a gamble as some may see it) would just be between you and the One upstairs. 

Who knows - you may see this person again someday, but it's more likely they will fade into the background never to be heard from again. But you can rest easy knowing you've done a good deed and given someone a chance - an opportunity that you know you would have taken if it had ever happened to you. You would be giving back to the universe as it has given to you.

Regardless of your decision, you will walk on and continue with your life. This is just another day, and life is good. The person before you will continue to be in need. 

The act of giving would make a world of difference and change someone's life. It is in your power. You can turn the wheels of fate. Regardless of what anyone says about possibilities and chances, anything can happen, as long there is a will and action is taken. The rest is all about choice. Nothing changes if nothing changes. Nothing happens if nothing happens.

I'm an athlete getting back into racing shape and been training a lot. I also work a stressful, demanding job and my body has been taking a beating. 

I don't generally get massaged. I work a lot and don't spend my spare time around people. Therefore, it likes being touched a bit too much - which is why I don't do this. That said, I do want to be naked. So I'd like a massage from a straight guy who gets how the male body works and won't take an erection the wrong way.

I don't care if you are clothed (though naked would level the playing field) and won't be bothered by contact - in fact, I enjoy the touch and body pressure. 

I'd prefer to pay a little something to keep it professional - unless we swap. I'm certified and can share some techniques.

I prefer a session without watching the clock, so please let me know what that would take. 

I'm happy to host, and have BioOil. Or I can travel to you. Just please reply to me with full stats, a photo, experience (if any) and what you have in mind. Cheers.

Hey, I'm making this post to see if there are any chill gamers who are looking to start a serious MOBA team or just talk about and play video games together! I've been playing the last couple organized tests for Paragon and now am in the Early Access and even though some MOBAs have deeper variety in moves/item builds, aside from the great graphics, I think the 3D movement and jumping/height playing a huge factor into gameplay actually makes it really unique with a lot of new potential! I've also played Overwatch in an early test and Blizzard usually does things solid even with the Activision merge, I've played a good bit of Heroes of Storm and think that's a fun one too, but from what I've played I think Overwatch has the edge over Battleborn for FPS/MOBA hybrids, even if it's a little similar to Team Fortress 2 in ways...but that's another one I want to get serious at lol, and already I've been rambling about a lot so you sorta get where I'm at!

Anyways, I'm down to chat about games and stuff and the connecting universes (cartoons/anime/sci fi) but I'm a fairly serious gamer so I'm really looking for people to practice with and/or form a MOBA team for ranked stuff and maybe even tournaments. If Paragon or Overwatch really interests you, or you're already playing in Early Access and want someone to team with, I'm definitely aiming to focus on those the most but I grew up on original dota and warcraft 3 so I'd be open to jumping back into dota2 if you play a bit, or Smite on PS4 I could probably play for fun every now and then. Also huge Pokemon fan and really excited for Sun/Moon, and actually gonna try and excel at Pokken Tournament too if you're interested in that too - I'm a bit better than a casual at Smash but nothing amazing lol, but Pokken I really wanna try to get good at for sure. 

So yah age is open and race or shit shouldn't matter so whatever you look like or are is ok with me as long as you are really interested in these games and gaming in general too! Have PS4/Wii U/3DS Steam on a Macbook and really aiming to play a MOBA on PS4 and core Nintendo stuff on Wii U, but I know Paragon has crossplay with PC and I assume Overwatch will too so that's fine with me if you only game on PC but are serious about one/both these games. If you'd like to know more about me I'm 22 and tall and skinny and mixed race, generally upbeat and goofy kinda guy but serious about the stuff important to me and trying to make the world a better more loving and connected place and all that jazz, and if it's not your thing no biggie but definitely 420 friendly if that can add to the mix.


Finally, this part will probably scare away anyone who managed to get this far lol, but my girlfriend and I have been trying to find a chill fun young woman to both have some sexy time with. She's fairly older than me and Bi, curvy white MILF type, and not really good at video games at all lol (but tries in certain things for me), but she's super sweet and smart as hell and sexy thick and if you're a sane clean woman who thinks it might be really awesome to have fun with a couple, we can definitely talk about that, with the gaming stuff or just separately if you happened to find this and are only interested in that lol. And if you're not interested in this part at all but totally want to game together and chat, completely disregard this and say nothing about it and I'll never mention it or make it weird if you won't!

Yes this post is real just gonna add that, don't know how anyone would think this isn't. March Madness just started and Yale won for like the first time ever.

Figured I would give this a shot....

I am 48.. look younger. Rocker type. 

Look for something on chat only. Someone I could send pics to and get pics from. Clean and dirty.

Send random texts throughout the day...etc.

I don't want to meet. I kinda like the mystery and it turns me on. We can use kik, Skype, etc...

I had something like this before and I really enjoyed it.

Wanted to see if there was anyone out there who thinks they would like that too.

I don't care if you are attached, married or whatever. Not my business.

Age, race...no biggie either.

Hey guys,

First, I know that posting this on this site is a bit of a shot in the dark. But I'm pretty desperate at the moment. I'm a 30 year old looking for some temporary housing for the next few weeks (potentially a month).

I just got a job in Glendale, but because of some circumstances I'm not able to afford the whole deposit and first/last months rent for a place. 

I'm hoping that someone could give me a break and let me crash/stay with them for a maybe a month or a month and half.

I'm nice guy, pretty down to earth, Disney fan, volleyball player, etc. I'm clean, willing to wash dishes, do laundry and all that.

I'm really looking for someone to give me a hand and help figure this out.

If you're interested, I can totally give you links to my Facebook or Instagram, etc.

Again, I'm looking for a break over anything sexual.

Thank!

Dick pics? ... NO, absolutely fucking NO!

I read all this bullshit on CL that get's posted by both men and women and it hurts my head just to read it! Why are there so many people looking for the same thing but can't seem to connect with each other on CL? Truth be known - it is entertaining for me to read, but I want more than just to read. I want to actually communicate with a real person, and yes I want that person to be female.

I'm looking to make friends. I recently quit my job because it's not what I wanted to do long term, so I'm looking for another. I live near Long Beach, I'd like to go grab some coffee, bar, or somewhere we could talk and get to know each other. 
Thanks for reading :)

I am looking to sell these shirts too... because they're a bit tight on me. I'm not a hardcore juggalo, but I used to be a big fan, only reason I haven't heard the new stuff is because of work. I'm half a decade behind I think... Last release I really listened to would be I think twizid's man myth mutant cds... So i'm behind. But still would love to find a juggalette or just a fan of psychopathic to hang with... i don't smoke or toke, but I don't care if you do... Yeah, just send a pic if you want to start talking.

Hey Crazy Craigslist.
I just bought myself a ticket to go see this lovely band; but I have never been to a show by myself! So a Concert buddy would be really nice. 

So about me in a nutshell. Im 25, kind of introverted. I've been told that I am a dork. I'm silly and a bit clumsy. I'm also artsy; I think that self expression is incredibly important. I'm athletically declined and I have 3 cats! I absolutely love music as well. If you're 420 friendly, that would be super cool.

I'm usually up pretty late due to the shift that I work. (I'm a cook working dat pm shift.)

I have photos of myself if you wish. Also, don't send me your dick. For the love of the baby Jesus, no penor pics. thanks.

Hope to hear from some fans out there :) and if not, check them out and chill out!

As title says, I have tickets for a pre-screening showing of the upcoming Batman vs Superman movie. The movie will be played this coming Tuesday in the Burbank area in a movie theatre (duh!) Haha.

I'm looking for a nice, ""sane"" girl to take along for the event. You don't have to be a super fan of comic book heros knowing every single little detail, but being a casual fan, a geeky/nerdy girl type would be a major plus and what I'm looking for, someone that would actually enjoy the movie.

I am open to this being just strictly platonic or if there is a bit of chemistry some hand holding/kissing may be in order. I'm not looking to maul someone who is feeling super uncomfortable, but I always like a bit of closeness with someone.

With that in mind, if this is something you are interested in doing, message me telling me a bit about yourself, and why I should select you to come. Ideally I would prefer a face pic at the very least to know whom I am potentially taking.

As for myself, I am single, 6 foot tall, a mix of Caucasian and Hispanic, 30 years old, have a career, place, car and all that good stuff, no drug use. I would say age wise at max 10 years apart from my own age, and non smoker, I just can't stand the smell. Otherwise I have nothing else I am really picky about. Good luck ladies :)

Are there any cute leprechaun girls (or women) -- of any legal age -- who might like to kick back today, have a toke, hang out, meet someone new, and sure, MAYBE even get naked, although the last part is not required?

I'm a guy, basically easygoing, intelligent, even fun. I'm fairly flexible about what we do, but generally just hang and yes, maybe get naked, although that is strictly optional, just an idea to enhance things and get your attention. On the other hand, if you're wearing green panties today, you should feel obliged to show them off. :) Maybe talk, or we can listen to music, or watch a video (I have several very good ones on hand). go for a walk in the park -- sure, any of that MAYBE naked (except the park, of course). Tell me your ideas, I'm open to whatever. I would simply enjoy the company, regardless of what we might do, and it doesn't have to be naked. Hey, maybe we even will make a new friend. Or more.

I'm older, middle age, so you have to be OK with that -- whether you're older, younger, it all works for me. Either way, even if an age difference, I'm sure you would be comfortable with me and enjoy, I'm cool enough. We should trade pics when I hear from you; again, I think you will be satisfied.

So there you go. Get in touch -- the day is getting older.

Hello, I am a part time model-actor-masseur living in Hollywood I am looking to connect with other GL masculine gay or gay friendly guys in the Hollywood area between the ages of 21-38 for potential friends & or workout buddies. I am looking for someone who is really into fitness & nutrition, and can help me with my fitness goals. I think it is fun when you have someone to workout with if we don't go to the same gym I'm sure if you're really into fitness you don't just workout at the gym and there are some other alternatives like maybe going hiking, running, biking, swimming, working out at a park or at the beach. I am a member at the Golds Gym in Hollywood on Cole street. I can always get guest passes, and I'm sure you can get guest passes over at your Gym that's if you don't already go to my Gym. I find it when you work out with someone that is really into fitness I feel like we can push one another to the max, especially in areas of working out that I feel I would need someone's help to push me even further with my workouts. My body goal is to reach 3percent body fat, to have 6 pack abs, and some nice defined biceps, but an overall proportionate well defined healthy and strong beautiful body. If you think you might be interested in meeting and see if we connect where we could possibly be friends and workout buddies then don't be shy and send me a message thank you!

For those that were curious to click great, and for those that actually read this post and genuinely give consideration, thank you.

I'll try to be concise, I am on the path of becoming a certified personal trainer. Not a big accomplishment if that's all I was seeking. I want to hear stories of short success, and failures. I want to hear core beliefs and rationale. I want to observe patterns and habits. 

My offer is straight forward I will help you with your fitness goal, no charge. In return we can engage in dialogue about past attempt, get feedback, and if you deem me great in my approach, maybe I can keep you as a reference.

I only have the weekends and truly my approach requires a weekly visit, no more. I seek only a few people 2-3 max.

I am out of Woodland Hills, but I can make a trip to cities near by.

The title pretty much sums up what I'm looking for at the moment. Someone to talk to...share moments with...wins and losses. Obviously, much of this will be dependent upon the connection achieved via communication. I'm all about connection - in all areas of life. However, I find myself working a lot lately and I am craving those really great conversations. 

If you enjoy reading and learning, we will likely get along. If you enjoy pushing your own limits and don't recognize the word ""can't"" in your vocabulary, we'll probably hit it off pretty well. If you can teach me something new and interesting (and are willing and open to learn from others), we 'll most likely have a good time. If you can look at life and not be jaded by the media, politics, religion (basically have an open mind), we'll get along just fine. Outside of getting along...I guess that's where chemistry comes into play. 

As for me... I am currently separated and in the process of divorce. I'm not really looking for a relationship. I have no expectations of this post other than to possibly make a new friend. But, I also believe it is important to keep an open mind, so while I am keeping expectations to a minimum, I am also open to possibilities - whatever those might be. I don't care about age, race, height/weight. None of that matters, really.

If you are at all interested in knowing more, please respond. Priority will be given to those whose responses have some substance. 

Looking forward to some great conversations!

and Love going to Magic Mountain : -------> Looking for same to hang out with .

i am willing to use my ""bring a friend pass"" for YOU to come along with me and
ride the rides and see maybe one of their shows at no cost to you.

BUT if your a true chub , then you'll want to spend some of your own money
on their foods for lunch and or dinner ,
I'll get you in but you pay for your self on anything extra.

OR

Bring a lunch like i am doing in a clean cooler with ice so when i/we get hungry , we'll have our healthy foods or cold pizza to eat . Which is Just as good cause your gonna burn some calories walking the park.

---> Here's the plan ,
We meet first for a coffee ,
then carpool or drive separate cars to Magic Mountain and get there by 9:00 am.
If you carpool with me , then parking is free ,

if you drive , then parking is $20 bucks for you to park for the day per car.

Park is open from 10:30 am to 8:00 pm

We get in line , then enter the park by 10:20 am,
Cause season pass holders get in 10 minutes before the rest of the public ,
which means we run to the best rides and hop on with in minutes ,,,, 

If your interested in going , let me know . This offer is only for SUNDAY March 20th .

Good intentions here , So no flakes. if you know you can go , your ticket is ready.

Thanks for reading , Nick...

Are there any cute little girl (or women) leprechauns -- of any legal age -- who might like to kick back today, have a toke, hang out, meet someone new, and MAYBE even get naked?

I'm a guy, basically easygoing, intelligent, even fun. I'm fairly flexible about what we do, but generally just hang and yes, maybe get naked, although that is not required, just an idea to enhance things and catch your attention. But if you;re wearing green panties today, you should feel obligated to show them off. Maybe talk, or we can listen to music, or watch a video (I have several very good ones on hand) -- any or all that MAYBE naked -- or go walk. Tell me your ideas, I'm open to whatever. I would simply enjoy the company, regardless of what we might do, naked or not. Hey, maybe we even will make a new friend -- stranger things have happened. :)

I'm older, middle age, so you have to be OK with that -- whether you're older, younger, it all works for me. Either way, even if an age difference, I'm sure you would be comfortable with me and would enjoy, I'm cool enough. I'll bet I even could make you laugh -- whether at me or with me. We should trade pics when I hear from you; again, I think you will be satisfied.

So there you go. Get in touch -- the day is getting older.

Hi there, Im bi wht male in my early 40s. Open and open minded, sincere, genuine and fun... Id love to find a cool open minded woman to chat with, maybe even get to know. I posted this in the strictly platonic because I am genuinely looking for friend(s)...Dont care if you gay, st8, pan, bi, trans, in a relationship , married , etc...nor am I terribly concerned with age, race, or looks... now with that said, yes Im single and am always open to letting a relationship take its natural course whatever direction that may be...but really Im just looking to maybe make a new friend... or even a chat/text buddy... And since I'm now coming to the realization that guys may very well be even more perplexing to be in a relationship with then women... would be great to have a ""girl - friend"" that I could easily talk to. I am educated, professional, work for myself (and alot), love good music, good food, my dog, and new adventures. I am a night owl by nature, hence its currently about 4:15 am. 

So if your open and up to it, drop me a line and say hi. Of course its always nice to put a face with a name...and if you care to send a face pic, ill gladly reply with one as well.

I tend to make friends with people who only contact me if they need something such as help, advice, money or someone to listen to them vent about their problems with little to no concern for how I am doing. I am looking for someone who I can trust and who is loyal. 
I am a pet lover with two cats and a puppy so if you have a dog it would be great if we can have play dates. I am a chill person who is not into clubbing or getting drunk/ high. I am a foodie, i love diy projects, nature, relaxing, and I am working on starting a non profit business.
I am the type of person to call or text just because i want to see how you are doing or if you want to go get coffee. Just looking for someone who has the same mentality. Age doesn't matter, Old or young, im just looking for a friend but. around my age would be preferred. I have a girlfriend so you must be friendly and open to the lgbt community and open to equal rights or at least be open to live and let live.
I hope to find someone out there and I hope I do not sound too particular, lol.

This is a straightforward post...if you are in town for business and would like company to grab a cup of coffee or a light meal in the Cerritos Area, shoot me an email. Your other option is to stay in your room, and relax! Which sounds nice, but every now and then we need a breather.

There is a reason why this post is in the platonic section - it's for non-romantic, non-sexual, friends only. In this case, acquaintances only. Don't read between the lines, there is nothing there. 

Important: I prefer well traveled, educated, healthy, and fit individuals. Ideally between the ages of 35 to 50.

It's tough.

Its been about half a year and I find myself still going through what I feel is depression and some anxiety.

I am 35, Korean, 5' 11"", fit, and have a degree, career, mortgage, and transportation. I guess these things are important because I do have my $%#& together.

I've been having a rough time dating honest and regular girls online. When I say regular, I mean women with jobs and transportation, and who take care of themselves.

Im am seeking a friend who is single or is going through a breakup, so we can relate and help each other and enjoy time together when life is sour and darkened by a previous bad relationship.

I enjoy hiking(i do), fishing, going out and making it an event eating out at trendy places, I love film, have a cat, an aquarium, skinny dipping in my pool, and working on BMWs. I want a female friend, someone who will compliment me and brighten my life.

I wish to fall in love again.

But simply, I am looking for medicine for my broken heart. 



send me a message, I would love to chat, text, or friend you on instagram. 

If I cant find love(lol on CL) I would love to find some good friends atleast.

I will leave this up until I find you.

Hey Everyone. I'm a good looking, fit, 27 year old male Dominant here. Have a ton of experience as a dominant. I play with females and males of any ethnicity, size, desires. 

I specialize in tickling and bondage play. But I do have experience with many other kinks / fetishes ... all dependent on the sub. 

I have a lot of experience with couples as well. Either side by side submission, or double teaming a partner. 

I do tickle dom for males, but I am straight. Though that has no bearing on the type of session. 

I do own most of my own equipment. This session can be STRICTLY tickle play, with no sexual expectations or desires. Again, dependent on the sub. I have had multiple sessions with lesbians who were seeking tickling play and others. Again, sexual activity is not expected from a sub. 

No reason to be shy. If you have ANY interest, message me and we can further discuss. More than willing to meet a local coffee shop for a drink and further discussion. 

More than willing to trade pics via emailing!

Looking forward to hearing from you all!!!

Hi there, So I decided to give craigslist a change and maybe make a new thin
and caring Female friend. I've been shy most of my life. I only have a few
friends in my life and no siblings and no parents either :( . Almost an orphan

Quick facts about me: I live near downtown LA, I'm caring, considerate, thin,
single, I don't have any kids, have helped thousands of people in my life (maybe
Millions), I don't have a car & don't need one, Height is not important or age

languages.i just did my background check March 2016 . Clean record. no felonies.
Type of friend I'm looking for: Live in the LA area, no kids (not even 1 and
no dogs either), thin, considerate, and really nice
oh and I recently went homeless because my roommate was insane and tried to kill me so I called the cops and she went to jail for a week and I packed my stuff while she was in jail and moved to a downtown shelter. No big deal
Oh I also create Websites for a living.
CALL me.
Music I listen to: Mostly Love Songs, Katy Perry, Blank Space, Mariah Carey
and relaxing music. 
Other of my hobbies and talents: Creating amazing Websites, Doing Special

I am looking for someone who values or appreciates art, or who can use some of my other skills to help me to get back on my feet. It would be nice if this person might also become a friend, and that we could cultivate trust and understanding.

About me:

I am a beautiful person inside and out, very talented, and I make beautiful art and music. I have always been very driven in pursuing my dreams and have run my own small businesses. For the last 2 years however, life just changed. Finally, I came to understand that I was suffering from PTSD. I was suffering a lot and I didn't recognize myself. I spiraled downwards into a crippling depression. I was looking for help everywhere, and as you may know, it can be very hard to find support and affordable therapy for anything related to health, especially mental health. But the good news is, I did find some answers and some awesome therapy. But it didn't come cheap.

I guess this is how the cycle goes. I am doing therapy and feeling greatly restored, but I am diligently trying to hold onto my peace. I took loans to pay for my therapy, as I was desperate - and now those loans are due to the tune of $5g. Yep, I should not have gone to a loan shark. Desperation can make you do stupid things.

I am starting my life over again. I am sober and well and getting my pep back. I spent the last 6 months painting for my own meditation. My work is beautiful. I am looking for an art lover/appreciator who could buy my art and help me get back on my feet. I can also do commissions. Other skills I can offer are interior painting and decorating. I am a great decorator with great taste. Another skill I can offer is styling. I used to have a make-over for men business - again I have great taste and am great at dressing men.

I am beautiful, fun, funny, smart and a great person to hang out with. I have had an incredible life with great stories to share and I'm a very good listener.

Maybe there is someone out there who has the means and interest to have a mutually supportive friendship with me.

Please write to me for photos of me and my art if you are interested. And please only respond if you are serious. I am a real person and I have been through a lot. It takes faith for me to do this.

Peace and gratitude~

I'm a 31 y/o Asian/Spanish mixed married guy with way too much down time at work. There are other things to pass the time, but sometimes I just want to have someone to chat with or trade emails with. It makes the day go by so much faster plus love getting to know someone new. If you're married, you might understand the situation of things feeling routine at home and a loss of passion and spark. I know it's something i'm missing and trust me i've tried to improve things on my end.

Anyway, whether you're in the same position and want to rant, or talk about anything but that to keep the mind off things, I would love to spend the time. Would love to meet one day if it ever comes to that.

I'm on the geeky side of things, I enjoy music, going to concerts, graphic design, pop culture, and whatever interests bring me happiness. I like to think that I can get along with most anyone. I'm on the chubby side but have been working on losing weight (and so far so good). 

Looking forward to having a chat and wasting the day away together.

Hi, 
I'm posting this in hopes of finding a best friend or more than one best friend. If anything, if I get one good friend from this, I'm a blessed person and I am grateful. I'm looking for a person who is serious about wanting a friendship. Who wants it a lot like me, and is willing to put in effort. As I am. Like any relationship, it takes effort, takes some of your time, emotions invested, heart, your support, your respect, loyalty, and you. No one sane can expect relationships of any kind to just happen and be there always without those traits. It's impossible and just not how life works. I know this, and can give it to someone who feels the same way as well. If you don't agree, then we aren't a good match. I need and want friends who get it like me.. Who is serious for a friendship. My life has been stressful for a long time, and lately I can't handle it very well. Having support helps. 😊Someone who cares about what I'm going through as I would care as well about what you're going through... I'd like to at some point soon hang out after getting to know you some. Getting out, and talking to someone in person is a healthy way to escape stress. It's also more comforting to be near the person who cares to hear what you have to say... I don't lie, don't disrespect, and I expect the same from you as well please.... I hope that there's a level of respect and understanding for each other's feelings. I don't want my feelings hurt please. As I hope that you'll be like family to me some day. Well, I thank you for taking the time to read this. I appreciate it, and appreciate you for doing so. I hope that you're having a good day my friend. Take care. 🙂✨

Ps. Please realize this is for Platonic only. There's a different section for something more..

Group therapy is an effective, powerful way to learn more about yourself and to achieve personal growth. Interpersonal group process can provide a sense of belonging, and an opportunity to connect with others and develop intimacy.

It can offer some relief for depression and anxiety, and be a safe place to explore and process self-esteem, shame, internalized homophobia, dating/relationships, sex/intimacy, coming out, and much more. 

This group will be run by a lesbian female therapist. All members of the group agree to honor confidentiality. This will be an open-ended group, where members can work at their own pace and leave when their particular needs or goals have been met. 

If you are ready to explore connection, intimacy, authenticity and personal growth, please be in touch.

There is a low fee per session. The group will meet Wednesdays from 7PM-8:30PM starting April 6th in Los Alamitos. If you're ready to make a change, please reply, and I will get back to you within 24 hours. I will answer any of your questions/concerns, and we can arrange an intake interview.

Finding a friend is my goal, to share conversations, which may become endearing, adventurous and downright fun.

I don't know why certain people are placed on your path, coincidences, fate or sheer happenstance but nevertheless, I have always cared and valued everyone I have come into contact with. 

You know what I really miss, I miss having my phone make that beautiful noise notifying me that I have a message, text or email, how my heart races and my breath quickens in that split second when I look down and see it's you. Are you the one this post was meant for, I sure hope it's you ;-)

If looks, age and marital status matters to you then, please don't bother to reply, I may not be the one for you. None of the above mentioned should matter if friendship is truly what you seek.

I wish you all the best and thank you for taking the time to read my post.

Hello I am a Hispanic Female in my mid 20's who is currently residing in Huntington Park and literally have zero people to chill with. A bit about me... i am happily in a serious relationship and not looking for anyone or anything!!! This is STRICTLY PLATONIC!!! I am straight, very outgoing, easy to get a long with, down to earth and a nice friend. I enjoy going to concerts, theme parks, mini road trips, getting my hair, nails, and brows done. I am girly but im not stuck up or full of myself. Dislike people who are like that. I LOVE music, movies, eating junk which im trying to cut back on. I can enjoy a glass of wine or occasional 420. Some of my favorite shows include Sunny in Philly, Bates Motel, OITNB, The Office, American Horror Story and so on. I love shopping for clothes and makeup... It would be nice to just find a cool chick that i can get along with, invite over for dinner, go watch a movie, go hiking together and just spend time together and in whatever we are doing just have fun and build a cool friendship. I don't care what your story is but as long as you make time for hanging out and actually want to be friends then its no problem. Please no men, no couples and no one looking for anything else than a nice solid friendship. Please be local (by local i mean not too far).

This is a straightforward post...if you are in town for business and would like company to grab a cup of coffee or a light meal in the Torrance or Long Beach area, shoot me an email. Your other option is to stay in your room, and relax! Which sounds nice, but every now and then we need a breather.

There is a reason why this post is in the platonic section - it's for non-romantic, non-sexual, friends only. In this case, acquaintances only. Don't read between the lines, there is nothing there. 

Important: I prefer well travelled, educated, healthy, and fit individuals. Ideally between the ages of 35 to 50.

I think average person's body can feel about 33 percent pain ,33 percent of pleasure and 33 percent of numb. If you want to have a child then you may expect a child to feel around 33 percent of pain , 33 percent of pleasure and 33 percent of numb too. Therefore you may be responsibility for causing that 33 percent of pain in a child. 

Someone may say if I want to live along with that 33 percent of pain therefore I bet that my child will think that way too. But I think that person should to keep it to herself and not put it on a child to think that way too. 

What if a person has 99 percent of pain and 1 percent of pleasure then will it still be okay to have a child with 99 percent of pains ? I think even if a person have only 1 percent of pain then it is still wrong to have a baby 

Let me make up a fake story so you will understand better. 

If a person has supernatural power then that person see a rock on road and say to herself that rock must be feeling 100 percent numb because it is a dead thing so she decide to use her supernatural power to change 100 percent of numb to 33 percent of pain , 33 percent of pleasure and 33 percent of numb on that rock 

Therefore the rock no longer feeling numb but both pain and pleasure. That rock seems not happy anymore because being 100 percent of numb is much better than feel pain and pleasure at same time. 

For small or big pain can ruin everything so it is very important to leave that rock alone. 

Likewise do not try to have a baby because before a baby was born, it may feel numb. The numb is more peaceful than feeling pain and pleasure same time.

So I'm looking for someone who might be interested in joining me to the gym (USA Fitness) on Friday, Saturday or Sunday and maybe just a friend in general. I'm pretty friendly, I may seem to be a bit weird but aren't we all? :p Anyways.. Things I like:

Learning Interests: Sciences, Psychology, Philosophy, Healing Arts, Physics (Hyperphysics), Esoteric Knowledge, Magic, Psionics among other fun things..
Research, Art (Favorites: Digital/Visionary.)
Music: Trap, Progressive Trance (Goa), HardStyle, Deep House among others..
I like to do Arts and Crafts.. 

It'd be nice to find someone who has similar interests.. I don't go to College, I research because i find that there is an infinite amount of knowledge that one can learn from through the internet. Plus researching is fun.. I'm 24 y/o & 420 friendly for sure.! 

Please be humble.. Message me if you think we'd be good friends.. :)

Do people talk anymore?

What has happened to the conversation of the past? People listening to the actual words you speak, ask questions for clarification, agree to disagree. At times I feel you will get a better response from your neighbors dog than your neighbor.

I must say that I love E-mail and Texting ( if your not speeding down the freeway ) but there is a time and place for that kind of communication.

A phone call when you know the other person is smiling, the simple things.

A little bit about myself, easy going, quick witted, sarcastic, at times have the vocabulary 
of a drunken sailor and up on most current events. Born in the sixties, prefer jeans and tee shirts over monkey suet.

Please tell me a little something about yourself; not just HI!!

Since most if not all the responses I'll get will be spam; to help me filter them out please put the color of the sea in the subject line of the E-mail.

ok. Using exactly this line some years ago I got ONE conversation going. Which went fine...

Nothing special, I tend to be more comforable within my peer group, which means similar in age, political leanings and economic outlook. (Oh wait... that's not going to play....)

How about a reasonable human being who hasn't seen a movie and wants to ? Or perhaps hold a decent conversation. I won't claim to walk on water, in fact I'm a bit of an asshole... just ask anyone.

But... I'm real. not clickbait and definitely not a scam. (of course.... they all say that.)

YMMV.

2016 is slowly creeping up on us and I decided that it would be great to make a few new friends. I'm in a really great place in my life right now and I'm looking for other women who are just as positive, balanced and looking for a laid back friend to occasionally meet with over events, dinner and drinks or just go for a walk with.

I'm straight, in a long term relationship and live in Queens. Even though I'm 30, I feel younger at heart but don't mind if you're older or younger. I was born and raised in Queens by very European parents.. so if we have that in common- great! Just to put it out there: I'm not interested in going to clubs or loud lounges. I'm past that stage in my life. I prefer dinner and drinks or going out for some art galleries, fashion shows, concerts, musem, lounges, restaurants and similar Fancy Classy activities. I've met some great women off of CL in the past and know there has to be more of you out there! Looking forward to hearing from you all. 

PLEASE tell me a little about yourself if you decide to reply With your number. Let's keep it real. I will call you so we can talk.

Hi guys, We are a gay couple--together for four years. We have been offered jobs in LA with the Fund for public interest and we are looking for a place to stay. We currently live at our house in Running Springs near Lake Arrowhead. We are 35 and 42 years old and open to many situations. We are primarily looking for a roommate situation possibly with benefits if the vibe is cool. We can also offer our roommate time to spend in our mountain home as well. We will be working to educate the public on the importance of protecting the honeybees from toxic chemicals. No drugs and no drama. We look forward to hearing from you. Talk to you soon.

Regarding an unusual subject: Male chastity

This is a type of lifestyle I've been very interested in exploring for awhile now and I wanted to get perspective from women as far as how they view this subject.

Keeping in mind that I really don't have any interest in Cuckolding or some of the heavier aspects of BDSM, I am wondering:

1) Would it affect your view of a man knowing that he willingly wanted to be locked in chastity? If so, why/in what way?

2) Is your view based on prior experience in being a keyholder?

3) While I know that one can't speak for the majority, do you believe that most women would be receptive to the idea of keeping their partner locked in chastity?

4) Would the thought of not having a cuckold type of relationship in conjunction with chastity be more appealing, less appealing, or have no bearing on your interest level?

Please no men. Again, I'm attempting to establish dialogue with a woman/women to get their views on the subject.

Thank you.

Looking for another guy to chat with online or via email off and on. Maybe eventually meet up in person etc, but since this is the internet playing it casual online for now.

I'm a dad of two with less and less time now a days. Software developer by day, be intimate with my wife at night, and family activities with kids on weekends. Into video games, card games, board games, Disney, anime, and manga, though I find I have little time to keep up with the absolute latest. Used to have annual passes for DL but with family growing and prices continuously going up, we're taking a break from the park for now.

If you're a programmer, don't mind talking about that either. Or if you're looking for a mentor or are experienced and looking to be a mentor. I work in C# and primarily back end of websites with some experience front end as well.

Wouldn't mind having a buddy to chat with about whatever, including my wife on occasion. She is not a hotwife, I am not a cuck, and we aren't into swap or anything like that, but I'd be cool to have a friend in the know on things I'd like to open her up to do. 

That last bit puts it in the territory of between Strictly Platonic and Casual Encounters, but this is fully NOT in the territory looking for action and anything even remotely related in person would be after gaining a comfortable friendship. (Note that is not a call out for eventual NSA sex or anything like that so don't bother replying if that's what you're hoping for.)

Please be clean, DD free, respectable, and patient. We personally do not drink or smoke, but I don't hold it against anyone as long as only casual/social drinker.

Transportation is included along with the ticket. 
I'm a safe, happy and sane person that does not smoke or do drugs.

Hello there, yes, i am real and today is 3.15.16
PLZ, DO NOT judge that Im married, and do not think im some low-lifer. read then you can judge later. and if you're going to place a judgement, then i URGE you to ask yourself if you're an Angle. if not, then move the F on.
I was browsing cl, and the amount of prostitution is unbelievable. This is why I decided to post on the platonic section, although I'm actually looking for more. 
I am a Arab-American, born and raised in Orange County-now in Downey . I've been married for 5 yrs, no kids, and intimacy has gone and i think its due to my career. communication wise, there is none. We are pretty much roommates but we care for one another, and im not looking to leave her.
I am a former military and a former cop and I can smell BS from miles away. so, please, if you decide to reply, all I ask is be who you are and respectful. I am 35 yrs old. I stand about 5-9, 188, lb, in good shape, fit, light skinned, brown dark eyes, military clean cut. I'm self-employed, well-off and well-educated. not to sound cocky but darn confident and i wouldn't need CL.
I earned everything myself through my education and career.
I am a dominant male who is RESPECTFUL and yet down-to-earth. I pretty much am looking for the same except the dominate part. and when I say im dominate, please don't think im some jerk or pervert man who can not get laid. believe me, if I just wanted to get laid, I can. but im looking for more than just sex. 
If you are in the same boat and interested in just chatting and MAYBE meet up for dinner, then you should be somewhat FIT, DRUG-FREE, mature, and have something going on for yourself. 
If this is you, then please reply with (In the same Boat) in the subject so I know you read this. please no one-liner. 
No, i will not ask for a pic. i respect privacy and i take it very seriously. 
looking forward.

Hi, it would be cool to meet people that enjoy searching/reading about spirituality such as new age ideas about auras, and consciousness. It's been hard to make new friends because of my introvert personality. I'm really only looking for female friends that are open minded to talk about anything from what we're going through and do simple fun activities such as go to the movies, beach, or grab coffee and walk at a park. Someone local would be ideal and around 22-30. I would like to make friends close by to the areas of: East Los Angeles, Downey, Southgate, Downtown LA, Bell Gardens, Montebello, Monterrey Park, Los Feliz, Echo Park, Huntington Park, City of Terrace Central Los Angeles, and Mid-City. If you can tell me a little about yourself with a picture and I'll do the same. I'm straight by the way. Hope you have a nice day.

Hello, how is everyone here doin? Great I hope, if not then let's fix that. I had to read thru some of the ridiculous posts to see how stupid shit sounds around here. No, I don't want to take you shopping for 'sexy clothes' no I don't want to watch movies naked spoon and cuddle in a hotel, no I don't want to do hardcore drugs, sorry I'm not going to exchange fully naked massages, and I'm not going to obsess over your feet...and that's randomly scrolling thru the first page, at this random time. 

Okay so what the hell is it I want then? I know it doesn't exist anymore, but anything as close to along the lines of an actual genuine friend. Someone who I can respect and likewise, someone who I can converse with, hang out and do whatever, because just each others company should be enough. You know simple stuff. 

If you'd like, feel free to drop me an email, I don't mind after that giving you my number, kik snapchat to talk. Any questions at all you have about me or for me or want to know go for it, hear from you soon!

Posted before and got nothing, so here goes again. I'm from Michigan and I'll be in LA from March 30 - April 2 for a conference. I'm coming with some fellow classmates, but I'm not sure I'll see them much. I'd rather not spend the few days all to myself, so I'm hoping I can find someone who wants to join me for readings and book/writer things around town. The conference costs $50 for students to attend and if you're into writing at all, it will be well worth it. If not, there are other things around town that I'm interested in that we could do as well. If I do find someone willing to meet up and drive me around town, I'll buy you dinner/gas and provide good company as well. (:

I'm an attractive guy, athletically built, a few tattoos and piercings, easy to get along with, fairly shy initially, but I warm up easily. I'm not looking for anything sexual, but hey, let's face it: We're all at least ""looking"" right? If things go that way, they go that way, but I'm really just interested in finding a good soul to hang out with for a few days, someone to talk writing and life and common interests with. I'm also pretty itinerant, so it's nice to know people I can come visit every now and then. If you're interested, introduce yourself and we'll get to chatting and see if this will work. (:

I'm posting here because I'm not looking to really meet but if the chemistry is there, who knows. Finding a friend is my goal, to share conversations, which may become endearing, adventurous and downright fun.

I don't know why certain people are placed on your path, coincidences, fate or sheer happenstance but nevertheless, I have always cared and valued everyone I have come into contact with. 
You know what I really miss, I miss having my phone make that beautiful noise notifying me that I have a message, text or email, how my heart races and my breath quickens in that split second when I look down and see it's you. Are you the one this post was meant for, I sure hope it's you ;-)

If looks, age and marital status matters to you then, please don't bother to reply, I may not be the one for you. None of the above mentioned should matter if friendship is truly what you seek.

I wish you all the best and thank you for taking the time to read my post.

Hello, 

We are an educated, sane, respectful married Latin Couple that have a demanding career and family life. We are very secure, fun and outgoing and look forward to our monthly date nights. 

We have realized that we are really social beings and we enjoy the company of others. Unfortunately, they see our kindness and the wifeys flirtatious and playful attitude as odd and, well, unacceptable. Obviously we are very open minded. 

We have also realized that we tend to get along better with men who are Latino, Educated, respectful and very humourous, not to mention flirtatious or receptive to the wife's attitude of pushing the envelope. 

So, we are seeking the following: 

YOU MUST BE: Latino, educated, between 35 and 40 years old, respectful, receptive and open minded, at least 5'8"" tall (wife is 5'7"" with heels!), must like to dance, Clean cut, easy on the eyes, and not afraid to pursue as a long term friendship. We dont care if your married, attached or single, we can practice discretion. Although you must be able to get out on Friday or Saturday nights for some dancing, happy hour/light drinking or coffee/tea meet. 

Wife is 40 years old, 5'4"" tall (5'7"" with heels), very small curvy BBW, size 10, loves heels, loves to dance to 80's hip hop, freestyle, KROQ 80's, Rock in Español and Salsa. She is well educated and is into deep yet humorous conversations. Loves to be able to message throughout the week (email only, will explain later, no phone # exchanges so please dont ask). 

Hubby is STRAIGHT, Latino, 42 years old, Educated, sane, and very open minded. Im very respectful and enjoy a night on the town with the wifey. I enjoy watching her dance and grind with a male friend and seeing the relationship evolve into more than just bar hopping or club dancing. Im best described as an observer. 

Please send us a G-rated, clear face picture, a worthy introduction (she will be reading the response and replying), your current situation, experience and age and height. On the subject line of the email, please enter or type HEELS so that we know you read this ad thouroughly and understand it. 

Planning to go out sometime soon for datenight, would like to correspond before then so that we may meet you in person. 

Once again. Reply with a G-Rated clear Face or Body picture, on the SUBJECT line type HEELS and include a worthy and catchy introduction. 

Hope to meet you soon ;)

Hey there how are you doing? I am 36 years old, married, with children... I find myself more and more bored and lonely as the days pass by. Yes the marriage life is OK, but life has become just to mundane, routine, complacent, just pretty much gets too boring... I can't help but think of the days when we first met when I would have butterflies or the excitement of picking her up to go somewhere. I'm not exactly sure what I am looking for, but hopefully can develop to a friendship where I would tell her things that I wouldn't tell my wife. I am not judgmental, since I am on here too, but hopefully we jive a bit and can just talk and go from there...

I'm a gay guy who recently just moved to the Westwood area and I'm just looking for a chill female friend to hang with that brings no drama to the table.

Just so you know I'm a pretty shy guy at first but I'm kind and get a long with most people. Would love a new friend to chill and smoke with. I work at UCLA and live by myself, so I'm independent and looking for someone who is similar to that.

If it sounds like a match please reply by email and we can exchange face pictures and more information. Thank you! :)

Hi there!

I feel like I need more fun in my life. Recently quite a few of our good friends have moved away (sad face). This time last year we were having an epic Pi Day party and yes, there was a pie eating contest! So I though to myself.. There has to be other fun people out there who like to do silly things. Here are some things I like to do.

Theme parties for no reason
Walking dead nights 
Going to Disnylady (pass holder)
Wii dance
Scrapbooking 
Upcycling 
Game nights
A workout buddy would be fun too

I'm sure there is more but that's a good start. Here is a little about me. I'm 32, love a good punny joke, married to an awesome guy, and am a loyal friends. We don't have any kids.

...at some point, you realize it would be nice to share the company of a woman. For conversation. For perspective. For the chance to get out of yourself, and to hear someone else's thoughts and feelings.

Because the act of reaching out is a necessary first step in any endeavor. 

Because to continue to do the same things while expecting a different result is insanity defined.

So if you're single, age-appropriate (I'll let you decide what that is), and interested in meeting a gentleman in his fifties, who's in excellent physical, mental and spiritual health, perhaps you might want to respond. I ask that you be articulate, in-shape, and understand the value of basic human interaction. I have posted here in strictly platonic not because I have no interest in sex (quite the contrary), but because that is something I have no interest in rushing into. If I can't speak with you or don't find it enjoyable, how great can the sex be?

Send a picture along, if you're comfortable doing so. If not, just send a thought on what I am suggesting. Why?

Just because.

Hello, I'm a 37 year old professional Caucasian guy going through some drama right now...going through divorce with kids and it's getting ugly with the Ex. We've been staying together, but it's not working anymore. She keeps destroying my property and took just about all of my money out of my account so I can't even get a motel for a few days until I get paid. Anyways, I'm looking for a place to crash for a few days. I work M-F, so it would really only be to literally crash, I'd be gone all day. I prefer if it were with a female, because I just get along better with women, and I don't trust men I don't know. (Probably has something to do with being raised by my mom and her 4 sisters.)

I'm respectful, honest, and handy to have around. I can't offer much $$$ for reimbursement for letting me stay at your place for a few days, but I can offer my time and skills. I can fix or build just about anything, I'm a computer whiz, I can build websites, I can do your taxes, I can organize your life, I cook, clean, and just about anything else you can dream up. I'm also a great friend and person to talk to.

I get paid the end of next week. I can give you plenty of cash at that time if you need it. So if anyone has a couch, a spare room, a camper/trailer or any where I can rest at night, please shoot me a text at 661 two0two 0eight5seven Thank you, and have a great day!

I'm new to my area so I don't know anybody so I spend all my time at work or at home usually quite bored. I'm posting this because I am shy so I have a hard time meeting people in public, and I don't really have anyone to text with to keep the day interesting. You can either be married looking for someone to chat with or single looking for the same. We can talk about anything, no topic is off limits. Playful flirting is welcomed but doesn't have to be anything sexual, though if that's what u wanted to talk about it can be fun. The only thing I ask is to be between ages 24-40 so we are around the same age. I am hoping for something long term not something to last a day or two. Be prepared to exchange pics it's good to have a face to see for the chat. If interested please respond and change subject line to whatever the date is. Look forward to chatting with u :)

I know, I'd laugh if I were you too but I am only resorting to this because I am in desperate need of some help and I figured, why not?

I got a speeding ticket for $430 and I am hoping this message reaches a generous human being who can afford to help a young and very hard-working creative person get out of a bind.

I've recently started my own creative business which is doing great but it is costing me so much to start and this ticket could really make or break my situation. My band mates and I also have unique opportunities with Grammy award-winning industry professionals and all we need to do is find our own recordings, which our connections will then use as a product. I did the honest and right thing by starting my own business because cutting hair wasn't cutting it (lol I know) and it has been going well but this ticket is really stressing me out! And I need to pay rent and feed myself. 

If someone kind hearted and interested in helping out another kind and decent human being is reading this, please help me. I am not looking to exchange sexual favors for money, I am only putting this out into the universe with my best foot forward and hoping something positive comes back.

If you need to see photos of me just ask.

Hello, my name is Ray. Im a simple 29...turning 30 years old guy. Im lost for some reason. I make money but not a lot, and im still lost. I enjoy meeting new people in my jobs, and im still lost. This can go on.

-I cant put my finger on it to be honest. I have been broken over many years from girls coming and going, bills that wont go away, friends that dont stick, and just never finding my peace that i desire. I put on a face to people that are around me, but inside i feel something is missing. I do not live my life in a depression state. I like bike riding, walking through the park, going to theme parks, and exploring places. Im mostly friendly, fun, funny, mature, and like a good conversation.

-The thing about seeking a Japanese speaker is because I plan to take a trip to Japan in September on my own and i desire someone to teach me Japanese until that time. I use to learn Japanese a few years back for fun believe it or not haha. I just want someone to teach me than learning from books mainly. 

-I just want to get away from everyone and everything for a bit and explore a different country on my own with no travel agency or such. Just catch a plane, get a hotel and go off on my own. I wouldnt mind i guess if someone went with me for a bit more fun.

Well if you are interested, then lets talk about price and times we could meet. Im free everyday after 2:30pm and free all day on Thursday. 

-Have a nice day and I hope this reaches the right person:) I do not mind how old you are, just as long as we get along well and enjoy each others time. Im pretty quiet and into Asian culture seeing as I mainly only date Asian women...anyways im talking too much, have a nice night:)

I'm looking to get to know someone who is into looking for a relationship but wanting to start out getting to know each other. 

I would like to know someone who is mature (attitude wise not age wise.) secure and just an overall good person. For example if you're a dude who acts like a dick to waiters or your into making people do things they don't want to do...yeah I don't want to know you. I'm only open to real people who are genuine. 

A little about me, I'm 27 years old Hispanic chubby and cool with it. I work full-time and I'm for the most part responsible and at times impulsive. I love rock music of all genres and other music. I'm trying to learn guitar and I'm a at home gardener. My other interests is drawing, history and researching anything that interest me. I'm looking for someone like minded so if interested please email some info about yourself. A Pic Would Be Cool Too.

Late-20's to mid-30's friend group is seeking a new addition to the squad. We are mostly artists - filmmakers, musicians, painters, and there's a few start-up tech, attorney types too. 

We like meeting new humans, and though we are typically known independently to strike up and instant-buddies with strangers, the idea of finding a pal on Craigslist is intriguing as well. 

We BBQ. Hike. Drink. Smoke. Go to concerts, movies, bodegas, taco gems, coffee shops, et cetera. One of our favorite spots to hang out at over a bottle of wine is The Americana (not ironically). 

If any of the above sounds appealing to you or weirds you out in a way that you're kind of down, hit us up. Any amount of info should do...

I am tall about 6'3 or 6'4 and would like to have a buddy that's the same height as me or very close to it. I'm open to the simple things nothing complex and keeping it light.

Please be in your 20's or early 30's and know that I am ready and open to something new and fresh.

I joined a writer's group via Meetup and enjoy it for its motivating me to write without requiring that I ever share my work. The meetings are each Sunday in Los Feliz, but I'd much rather just have a (somewhat) weekly ritual of walking over to a cafe off of Pico, or even one in Ktown, and doing my thing there. If you're picking up what I'm laying down then reply with your favorite show as the subject line.

Hello there and yes, I'm a real life living, breathing female. I'm not a pro just looking for someone to play with. I feel alive when I'm dominating man. Perhaps this could turn into something more long term if all goes well. I'm only into safe, sane and consensual play! 

I'm into:
giving: spankings, pain, biting, pinching
using: bondage, restraints, toys
Have any questions? Just ask me. 

Tell me about your kinks or fantasies and let's see if we have chemistry. I only play in REAL LIFE, no web cams. 
Please be around 30s-43 years old and know that I'm absolutely not attracted to men who are short, balding, obese or skinnier than I am (so you need not reply, if this applies to you)
Serious replies only!

Hello--

I'm pretty sure there aren't many posts like this. I'm not looking for any kind of dependent relationship. I hate clingy people and I am definitely not one of those.

But I am reaching out without any real expectation of results. I am recovering from heroin addiction. I am in the entertainment industry and value discretion above all things.

As I have began the journey of recovery it's been really eye-opening how people I thought were friends--both addicts and non-users--have dropped contact with me. I can understand in part their reasons, but still for someone like myself, who has always loved and accepted people unconditionally, I feel a deep sense of abandonment and I am running out of places and people to whom I can turn.

I am not a 12-step person so I don't do those groups. I have had some benefit from my participation in some non-12-step settings.

If I were to express what I'm looking for it could be: (1) as simple as the time someone wrote me a brief note of encouragement, (2) someone willing to engage in occasional, limited contact support via text, email or other electronic means of communication, or (3) perhaps there is someone out there willing to engage me in a limited, no commitment role of support at first, yet willing to explore a deeper and more intimate degree of emotional support (within mutually agreed upon boundaries) after a solid degree of trust and confidence has been established.

All replies and communication will be kept in the strictest confidence and the expectation is you will likewise honor my privacy and confidentiality.

Submit replies via CL. Replies that are respectful and cast no aspersions or judgments are welcome. Anything that does not reflect a tone that is positive and constructive--or is in any way detrimental to the process of my recovery--will be discarded without acknowledgment.

Hi,
I'm looking to make some friends for gaming and for hanging out in person. I play a variety of games and platforms. It's hard to explain it all. I'm not a fan person because they are close minded to one company. I like them all, and complain about the company that is doing wrong when it's deserved. I tend to cuss when I play, because I really get into gaming. Not angry though. I'm a passionate person and am serious about the things that I care for. Though not too serious. I won't be upset at anyone if we mess up in game while being on a team. Hey, I tend to be the person who screws up. 😖 I just cuss a LITTLE out of frustration. I'm human. 😋🎮 Being friends, we are here to help and support each other in game and out. I'm happy to lend a hand if you need help in game or moral support. I'm kind, caring, loyal, considerate, ect. That's my personality. I really hope anyone likes my AD and considers me a friend to game and hang out. I hope you're having a great day my friend. Take care. 🙂 Xxx

Hello, I got a great sofa using craigslist so why not someone to just talk to! Let's have an anonymous connection, I won't know your personal details and back. We can just virtually hang out, tell me about what's bugging you or I'll talk to you about a very weird movie I've seen, discuss how good steaks are and how McDonald fries are the best. Do you like mountain climbing, or racing? I do too, but heights and unmanageable speeds are still scary. 

We can talk about our daily lives, recent problems, achievements, procrastination, and anything. The point of this is just to have someone to listen or talk with because we're all stuck or in circles, sleeping under a busy crazy world in the endless cycle of the day job. Whichever way, let me know, maybe we can be great anonymous penpals.

My birth year: 1990 and I've just gotten out of a conservative Asian background. I feel old... It's like I am stuck, I can't rev up the jeep, and things are in circles. I still have no idea what to do, and I am trying to figure it out, how about you?

Would she enjoy a soothing, relaxing massage from a very safe, and discrete man?

I would like to give her just that. I will remain clothed at all times and ensure that she gets nice and relaxed for you. . .. I am not a professional but have been taught several things from a certified masseuse and will do all I can with my hands to work her neck, shoulders, back, legs, feet, and or anything else she may want caressed and massaged. My thick, strong hands are very capable of working the places that she has the desire to be touched.

I will not ask for or expect for anything in return, this is for her and about her. I am not using this as a way or scheme on hopes of getting more than this, it is not. I just truly enjoy giving a woman pleasure and relaxation with my touch. 

I promise total discretion and once you are done with me, I thank you and leave. Unfortunately, I am unable to host, but will be more than happy to travel to you. By all means, if you have any questions, feel free to ask and see if I might be someone you are interested in.

Some of you might asking why I am looking for a couple to do this with and the answer is this. I have always wanted to massage a man's wife while he watches. It is erotic and pleasing to do it without that aspect, but I think it will only be more so, if he is there watching. 

I am a very clean cut, masculine white man, late-forties, and like I mentioned, VERY DISCRETE. If you do choose to respond, please put ""massage"" in the subject line. If this posting is up, I am offering this for you later in the evening.

Have a nice evening.

Thanks for viewing.

I am heterosexual with no ulterior motives. I feel our society and people within it have become increasingly degenerative, selfish, inconsiderate, and lacking of qualities that would define one as a decent, salt-of-the-earth human being.

I don't claim to be perfect, nor do I expect that of others. I'm simply in search of true friendship, and those that have ability to reciprocate someone else's goodwill.

I was raised outside of Los Angeles, and will be drawn to someone possessing the core values of their upbringing/environment.

I am mixed culturally, identify as a black woman (overall), and defy my ""real age"". I take care of me, physically and mentally. I don't smoke or drug, but have no problems with a nice drink or two, (smile). I don't have children.

If any female relates, and could use a steady female friend, I'd love to hear from you. Photo appreciated, and will get mine in return. Too private for the Internet.

Hi,

Long story short I am looking for a women to baby and diaper my husband...we are going to be married in a few months and i want him to experience this now before we are married..We both asked what kinks we wanted to get out, I did mine and this is one of his...I am not doing this for him because I had a bad experience with adult diapers years ago..I do not think this is weird at all, we are all a little strange lol

Ideally he would want someone to treat him like a toddler and put him in diapers, which he has. ANR is more than fine with me...I would want platonic with this...if anything more we can discuss it. He always wanted a mommy and I am trying to find him one for the time being.

His schedule is flexible and this can be a one time thing, a one day thing or even more. I asked him what his preference is and he said anyone that will diaper him lol doesn't matter how young(must be over 18) or how old or skin type or body type

I am looking to play tennis in Burbank/Glendale. I live in the Rancho (Equestrian) district. I used to coach boys AND girls high school tennis (3 years) and played 2 years of Division II & III college tennis. It's been years since I played but I just bought two new tennis racquets and am antsy to try them out. 

Although I have been divorced 19 years and NEVER intend to marry again, I am still a semi-attractive, educated, funny, man to spend time with. You are welcome to bring a friend to meet me or watch us to make sure you are ""safe"". I AM single but... this is strictly platonic!

I prefer playing at a Burbank public muni court first before plopping down any cash on a club court for someone I haven't even met. Afterwards, I can give you directions to a safe place you can freshen up at in Burbank so you can continue your day without having to go home. Most of us with actual jobs practically live out of our cars in Los Angeles and travel extensively away from our residences so it's not important to me that you LIVE or WORK in Burbank/Glendale. 

I own my own calendar and can meet anytime of the day, any day of the week if I have a little forewarning. Let's keep it to about 90 minutes. NOTE: I prefer playing with physically attractive people. I don't mean to be cruel, but I maintain myself. This is NOT an offer to help someone lose weight, or learn to play tennis for the first time.

Thank you.

So, it's been said that men and women can't be friends. I don't believe that's true. But certainly a straight man and a lesbian can be friends. Yes? Know this--I have not desire to try and change your sexual preferences or desires. I don't even think that's possible. I don't want to watch you and your girlfriend/significant other makeup or have sex. You know what I think when i see two hot women being intimate? ""There go two hot women who have zero interest in me."" Also, I have NEVER attempted to be intimate at ANY degree with someone who didn't want me as well. 
Female energy is different than male energy and perspectives are also different.

I would like to share some if not all of the below.
1) Regular meet-ups for coffee and or lunch for deep intimate conversations. Intimate--read personal, substantive depth. I'd like to create a space where we can say what's on our minds without judgement. I don't believe honesty needs to be brutal.

2)Creative collaboration--I write, act and want to get into photography and drones. I'm writing a book at the moment--it's cathartic. I really would love a writing partner to write screen plays.

3) 420 and number 3. Only the good--not stress. Don't worry i got you.

4) Golf. I am learning so you know I love and hate it. If you already play--you need to be patient.

5) Workout. Maybe just make sure we show up at the gym rather than actually working out together. WHAC? I also want to start taking yoga classes. I am in the Woodland Hills area and probably not going to travel very far to a gym or yoga studio.

You will find be to be very good listener and generally in a good mood. I don't do a whole lot of complaining. 
I lean left politically even though I am former law enforcement. I don't judge--please don't judge me. At first discretion will be important--not because we are doing anything wrong--I just don't feel like having to explain how we met. If/When we establish a solid trusting friendship then maybe our significant others can be let in--but this is really for me.
I am also interested in Metaphysics, witches, psychics, Tattoos ( I have only one but want one more)Western and vedic astrology.
I have no tolerance for bigots or racists. I am not hung up on age but I can't handle immature--so let's say over 30 and as long as you can get around, I don't care how old you are.

I like watching just about all sports.
You don't need to send a photo but if you must have one of me (why?) then send yours. No time for b.s so write ""Rachel Madow"" in the subject line. I love her!

We're looking for a woman to join us for a little platonic fun. We are interested in chemistry moreover age, nationality, or physical size. We both enjoy the company of a bigger/thicker girl (bbw) however; it certainly isn't a deal breaker.

If you're curious, open-minded, and interested in reaching out to discuss some possibilities, yet have little to no experience with couples. . . We are always willing to invest the time, compassion, and positive reinforcement needed to embrace your curiosity resulting in what can be an unbelievably beautiful and empowering experience. If the chemistry is right, we're also open to exploring a more intimate arrangement.

I am Caucasian, 5' 4"", brunette, blue/grey eyes, and thick. My man is also in his early 40's, 5' 8"", Hispanic, and husky. We are drug (420 ok) and drama-free.

If interested, please place 'Best Buds' in the subject of your response so I know you aren't a bot. As a courtesy we ask that you please provide a pic with your response. Any responses without an image will be ignored. If our post is up we are still looking.

Hello,

I have a daughter turning 8 who would love a consistent friend or two (boys welcomed!),
to have playdates on a regular basis. She is homeschooled so we are flexible. 

We live in Torrance. Let me know if you're interested in a park playdate for starters! Thx.

Looking for a lovely lady who wants to party and get wild.

People say they want to stay up and party all night but rarely there are those who actually do. If you're looking to party and have the time of your life, then we should talk.

If you want a truly psychedelic experience, you came to the right place.

I'm a single, white, professional male in Santa Monica. I am presently single, and the thing I miss the most about relationships is having someone to cuddle with. So I figured, why not take it up a notch and see if I can't find a few friends to cuddle? It should make it more comfortable for you (i.e. not immediately alone with a stranger), and it's just that much more awesome snuggling for me!

Ideally, I'd like to find ladies that are around 18-40, preferably single (don't want to get into any drama), hwp, naturally easy going, affectionate, and fun. I'm a laid back guy, always smiling and laughing, and very cuddly and affectionate. I'm open to hanging out just a few hours or overnight, which can be great if you live nearby, like hitting the beach early, or want a cool place to crash after a night out on the Promenade or at the Pier. 

So, if this sounds like you (and possibly your friend), drop me a note, tell me about yourself, and let's trade some photos. Hope to see you soon.

So it turns out guys have biological clocks, too, and mine has been ticking louder and louder. Thing is, I don't know anybody looking to settle down and start a family right now-ish, so maybe that's not the way to go about it for me. So, I've had a few ideas for how to have a kid without necessarily following the traditional rules:

1. Ships in the night. Under this idea, we would only have to hang out long enough to get the job done. I'd sign all the papers up front saying I'd never try to find you (and vice versa), you raise the kid free of interference, and I rest easy knowing at least I did my part to pass my genes into the next generation.

2. Co-Parents. Under this idea, we become friends and work on making the baby from the outset with the understanding that nothing else has to happen. We will not plan on being anything more than two friends who have a kid together and both participate in raising him or her.

3. Fairy-tale ending. This would obviously be super, but not necessarily the most realistic. Under this plan, we try the whole whirlwind romance thing while simultaneously working on making a baby, and try our darnedest to live happily ever after.

Obviously, I've got a little bit of a sense of humor about all of this, but I'm very serious about wanting to try out having a kid. So, if any of these ideas appeal to you, drop me a note.

About me: single, white, professional male, hwp, brown hair/eyes, healthy, history of long lived ancestors and no serious illnesses. I'm reasonably open to who I might do this with, but please be healthy enough to have and care for a child, not heavily overweight, and not into drugs or alcohol. 

Looking forward to meeting you!

I've been single for over a year now. After a few long term relationships changed course for various reasons, I took some time off from romance. I've been celibate by choice for a while. 

For the most part, I'm happily single. Lately, I wake up every day with morning wood. Hell, even the thought of regular phone sex with a wild and willing partner sounds like FUN. 

Bottom line: I'm open to honest intimate discussion with open minded friendly ladies, to a no strings purely sexual casual encounter, or a new long term romantic adventure.

Now with Spring in the air, I feel a call to connect with a lady again ... whatever form that connection takes. Bottom line, I miss female company. I can use a woman's touch.

I love women of all races, shapes and types: petite, voluptuous, BBW, dark, light, lean, curvy Anyone with a twinkle in her eye, a lust for life, and a spark of passion in her heart. 

I like open-minded, honest, intelligent, funny, sensual, creative, strong women, who can throw me down on a bed and show me a trick or three, or handle a good old-fashioned manhandling. 

I appreciate simple pleasures:. I like laugher, art, music, books, films, sports, animals, nature, massages, cuddling, artistic foreplay, gentle love making and wild animal sex, (in no particular order). 

We can email, text, talk on the phone, or of course ... connect up close and personal. We may get to know each other before we meet, or feel a spark and hook up for a sunset stroll on a whim. 

I'm curiously passionate and passionately curious by nature. I enjoy open-minded discussion about human nature, spiritual evolution, politics, the exotic and erotic. 

I'm an artist, in search of a muse, a free-spirit at heart, a rebel looking to be tamed by the right gentle touch.

I am curious to hear YOUR passions, pleasures and wild desires. Tell me what YOU want! Send whatever photos you deem appropriate. I'll do likewise. Anything you want to know about me, just ask. 

Meanwhile, I wish you all the best in your search for sex, love and happiness. I'd love to hear from you. Either way, enjoy a wildly colorful life.

I am a male CMT with specializations in deep tissue, acupressure, trigger point, and Swedish massage. Over the years of helping people with massage therapy, I realized a massage works when there is a connection between the mind and body of both the therapist and client. I created the Body and Mind Synergy Bodywork (BMSB) model solely for this purpose. The BMSB model is a combination of four modalities aforementioned, and it seeks to enhance the cognitive process by applying a range of muscular manipulations, from very deep to light touches, deliberately and appropriately. The kneads and strokes are applied slowly and continuously. The result is relaxing, yet invigorating.

If you'd like to get a private BMSB massage, contact me for more details. Incalls/Outcalls welcome.

I have an abundance of enthusiasm for things I care about, and believe in leaving the world in a better state than how you found it. Being open-minded and accepting of others' lifestyles and cultures is very important to me and is a big driver in how I interact with people around me.

Some might call me a wide eyed idealist but I don't mind :) I stick to my convictions and believe that open and honest communication could solve almost any issue.

I am addicted to traveling, and fell in LOVE with Africa last summer. Someone once said to me ""We have money, they have life"" and it couldn't be more true.

Hi ladies. This is a very real ad, by a very real and respectful man. I know there can be a lot of creepers on CL, and I honestly don't understand why it has to be this way. I've made some phenomenal long-term friendships via Craigslist. I'm consistently blown away by the wonderful friendships I've made.....some single women, some married, some that bring their husbands. As long as you feel safe, then I feel good about it.

I am a handsome, in shape, and respectful man. I'm very well educated, caucasian, clean, and can host at my upscale condo. I would insist on three things before we meet. I would need to see a G-rated picture, a little communication via email or phone prior to meeting, and one coffee date before we decide to move forward. This is for both our protection, just want to be safe and want you to feel the same. 

I am a massage therapist, have a table, along with scented and unscented oils. I will NEVER do anything that you wouldn't want me to do, and give me the green light to do. It is truly my goal to deliver you a relaxing and sensual massage. If you decide halfway through the massage that it's not for you, then we will stop. I always always always have your best interest at heart, and always want you to be relaxed, comfortable and feeling sexy and beautiful. 

Please put today's date in the heading of your email so that I know you're not spam, along with an email and what your expectations are. I will respond with a picture, and we can discuss further. Good luck in your search.

Hello everyone.
How are we today?

Let's get started with the post.
I am in search for a girl 
a friend;someone who I can share anything with without judgment and vise-versa. Someone around my age (21-27) since I am 25. Someone just to have fun with and have a great time.
I am a bit of a geek so someone in that human spectrum of geekiness.
I am not looking for a relationship but I am not opposed to a relationship if the chemistry is there; but again mainly looking for a friend and that is the main priority.

A bit about me
Like I said I am 25. I live in Los Angeles (You can ask me where exactly when you answer the post lol). Again I am a bit of a geek and like comics, movies, shows, music, video games. i claim to be an a photographer haha so on my free time I love to take pictures of random things, I like to read and play my guitar. Oh almost forgot I love to travel haha seen many places around the world but still have to see much, much more. I am a big boy I do have a job.

I will leave it as it is so we can have something to talk about.
I am an open-minded person so When you answer you can ask me anything you would like to know about me and I will most likely respond honestly lol

Well that being said If you guys have a kik and decide to answer you guys can reach my kik at jondoe297.
And you guys answer via email please put your favorite character as the subject, a bit about yourself an a picture would hurt. I am not shallow but would like to know who I am talking to. In return to your generosity I will also send a picture.

Haha thank you for your time baring with me and reading this post and hope to hear from you soon.

Hi for those who do not know what ABF stands for adult breastfeeding and ANR stands for adult nursing relationship and breast worship is pretty self explanatory. So if that doesn't sound appealing to you than you should stop reading now. So I'm looking for someone who is either lactating or would like to lactate in the near future. I do not care about your weight, size, height, ethnicity or anything like that. I am only interested in your breasts, the bigger the better in my opinion but I'm open to any size. If your interested in talking more send me an email with the title ""I got milk"" or ""got milk"" if you have kik contact me at the address in the picture. People who have No experience and new comers alike this before are welcome to send me a message. Hope to hear from someone soon.

Verify: It's Apr 2016!

Thanks for clicking on my post! I hope I'm what you're looking for!

I'm currently looking for a 100% no-strings-attached relationship with an older Asian woman, preferably over the age of 30. I find older women attractive not because of the cub / cougar fantasy, but because of the experience that older women have. It turns me on to meet a woman who knows what they want, how they want it, and won't confuse or mistake sex with a relationship.

I'm currently 21 years old and a business student at USC. I'm Asian (born and raised in LA), roughly 5'7 - 5'8, and fit. Been going to the gym 5-6 times per week, so I'd consider myself in pretty good shape! I also don't smoke anything (but am 420 friendly). I'm passionate about life, and love to approach things one step at a time. I have interests in all sorts of things from superhero movies, sports, food, and more. I think my best trait is that I'm very easy to get along with, and I guarantee you that I'll be able to make you laugh with my humor :)

Once again, I'm seeking a 100% NSA, discreet relationship with an older woman. I'd love to be your boy toy, one that you can call and I'll come to respond to any of your needs right away (granted it doesn't conflict with classes, etc.) Sex-wise, I wouldn't say I'm the most experienced -- been only with 2 people -- so I'm hoping to learn different techniques and explore some fantasies with you.

My only requirement is that you're easy-going (and clean/DDF of course)! This will be a completely discreet relationship, so I don't care if you're attached or married, etc. I'd prefer you to be easy-going, as I'd love to have a FWB relationship with a person that I actually get along with away from sex. It'll be great to sometimes meet up just to talk over a cup of coffee!

If what I'm offering sounds of interest to you, please don't hesitate to reach out! To weed out the spam, please put your city on the email subject line. And then tell me more about yourself! What are you looking for, etc. Plus.. a picture of yourself is greatly appreciated! (It'll let me know you're real)

Need a friend? 

Ever consider writing someone in prison? They are quite possibly the best friends you could have. You can request anything as a requirement and such as age, sex, race, location, crime, sentence, get someone you'll genuinely enjoy corresponding with. The best part is now a growing number of facilities allow you to simply email inmates. We have been in the business for a few years and have put countless friendships together that last for life and we even have had relationships blossom. Everything is free of charge. Email us today to simply ask any questions about what we do. If you would like to sign up and allow us to connect you with some new friends include the following.

A picture of yourself along with a brief description of yourself and what you want in a pen pal as well as how many pen pals you would like us to send your way.

This could be the beginning of something beautiful!

Hi there, I'm looking for a kick ass guy friend. I'm a single mom so stop reading if you have a problem with that.

I am looking to get toned up and get in shape and it's always better with a friend. I'm confident, sassy, and fun to be around. I don't get out much so it's hard to meet people that don't assume I'm already taken. I'm not. I have a membership to magic mountain so if u do too that'll be a plus. I want to get on the new ride there coming out soon. I have 2 children so if u have kids and we get along good as friends then it may be cool to do other adventures with the kiddos down the line. For now though it would be nice to talk to, text, and joke around with another adult. Please be between 31-37. I'm 31. Talk to u soon and Send a pic so I know whom I'm talking too!

Friendly, discreet, attached man seeks to correspond with ladies interested (at least at first) in a platonic relationship. I'm not looking to leave my marriage but would love to chat with ladies in perhaps a similar situation as I'm in and hopefully form lasting bonds, through which we can help, advise and be there for one-another.

If you want someone to listen to you and perhaps someday meet, let me know...It would be helpful if we could be geographically close to one another, ideally in or very near Burbank (California). Please be at Burbank or fairly near Burbank as I'm not looking for long distance relationships. I love walks and conversations and prefer to do so in person but texts/emails may do if that is what you'd prefer.

My arms are open and our minds should be as well! If you are willing to reach out and take that first step, I assure you that you won't be disappointed! Remember that the journey of a thousand miles can begin with that first step! Also, please note that if you want to see a picture of me, you should share yours with me--ladies first--as well! I understand that looks can be part of the chemistry that some people look for in a relationship and I can certainly respect that. Concurrently, what really draws me to a lady is truly what is inside her and what she can bring out of me. Let's bring out the best in one-another as friends and perhaps as more down the road!

Before you ask more about me--than already stated above--would you be a dear and tell me about yourself as well? I'm truly interested in getting to know you and that is only possible if you share about yourself too.

I don't need a picture of you or anything because that's not important when it comes to having a conversation with someone. Personality and a connection is what matters most to me. Same thing goes for race, I like all races so that's not an issue either. 

I love food, I love watching MMA and I'm also a big time wrestling fan of the late 90's into the early 2000's. I love to draw, listen to music, I'm an old school nintendo fan (nintendo 64,gamecube, wii). I'm also a fan of marvel movies and DC shows such as arrow and the flash. Hell I love talking about sex too if that's what your into as well lol. I'm great to talk to about issues or problems and I love to listen and give advice especially women with man problems.

Hello , 

Thank you for stopping by . Please let me introduce myself . I am a 42 years old gentleman in Rancho Cucamonga , California . Single with no kids . I am honest , sincere and trustworthy . I do not smoke or drink . Clean and drug disease free . Thank God . Would you be interested in a trusted company , a loyal follower and a humble servant ? I am extremely submissive and a servant for the lady by nature . I need the discipline , guide and control of a loving dominant woman . I am so warm , giving and caring . I am a sweet subservient man who you can feel comfortable with and treat as if he is a girl or a maid . I would never show male aggression or ego . If even you happen to be naked in front of me I would cast my eyes down in respect . I respect women highly . Regardless of how old you are (as long as you are not a minor) or how you look like or anything else . I would always act in humility and speak to you with a lot of respect . I would never ever dare be rude or disrespectful .

It is my pleasure to serve , obey and follow a lady's instructions . I serve with heart , honor , grace and pride . I would be honored to serve and please you . I would put my all into it and would not save an effort on my part to make you happy . I would obey you in everything you say . I will be at your beck and call and at your finger tips at anytime . I work independently and I am very flexible with my hours . I would accept discipline , scolding , humiliation and any form of punishment you might decide to impose on me for any reason with acceptance , grace and humility . I would honor you , respect you and fully submit to you . I would be your trusted personal servant and personal assistant . I would be your maid , your houseboy or as you want and wish for me to be . I would be loyal to you no matter what and would always make you a priority . I would cook , clean , massage you , do your nails , wash your clothes , wash the dishes , wash your car , organize your stuff , run errands , drive you places and do everything you need , assign for me or instruct me to do . I would listen to you , be there for you and even be like your best friend when you are in need . I would not seek for sex or any benefits . I would not ask for anything in return , but your care for me . Your guide , your lead , your approval and your acceptance . 

There ought to be at least some chemistry and some sort of a connection though . We ought to get to know eachother and that it be an ongoing thing not a one time encounter . It is also worth mentioning that I kindly would not be able to contribute financially or pay for any expenses or costs of any requested or demanded service . Sure that would not be the case if a unity and a true loving relationship develops . I am intelligent and well educated . I am a true gentleman who has confidence and self respect . I though long to serve , please and belong to a woman who is caring , trustworthy and special . A snap of your fingers and I would be humbly kneeling at your feet . In case there's a possibility and things develop for more I would very much be open to a true loving D/s female lead relationship . 

With all respect ,

Thank you

I wake up to a dread sense of loneliness and a sense of isolation, I wander down dark and lonely mental roads. I wonder if the voices in the back of my head would shut up and leave me alone. I want to cry, but cannot, though I feel such unbearable sadness, I remember how my mother would beat me as a child and tell me crying was unmasculine. Its funny the way childhood conditioning affects us as adults, like the way you cannot chase away ghost because they ultimately live in memory. One cannot exercise memory, so in that way one can say free will is a lie. We react ultimately out of the negative parts of ourselves, our own psyches work against us in dark alley ways of the minds. A conspiracy of ego, id and superego. Or which ever way the mind works: it's a Freudian model of human consciousness now discredited by modern psychology but still pertinent to modern American pop-culture, and perhaps both at odds with and congruous to Christian religions: because of the Father, The Son and The Holy Ghost, both being modeled off a Platonic model of human consciousness. But it leaves the question can mankind truly understand itself or is it like a glove, you cannot understand the interior surface of a glove while you are wearing it, once a glove is off understanding the interior works over the human hand is a lie. There are no perfect gloves. The feeling of the hands is lost, or warmth of its interior is lost in the attempt to understand the concept of glove, therefore our reality is an illusion, we are ghost inside a bad movie, only there is no Neo to save us.

Hello ladies, 

I am posting here because I would like to talk to more women, just as friends. I like talking to women to help me view things in a different view. Not only that there's just something about hanging out with a woman that is just a nice change of pace, than when hanging out with the guys. I live in the Van Nuys area but we can talk through facebook, text, or snapchat. if you are willing to hang out that's a plus but not necessary. Another plus would be if you are willing to hang out with my group of friends and you can invite your group of friends, we are trying to add females to our group. We feel that we are missing a woman's touch to the group, but if you rather just talk 1 on 1 that's fine as well.

A little about myself I am 22 years old. I will be turning 23 later in the year. I am salvadorian. Here are a few of my interests, I hope to hear from you soon.


Shows:
Anime (Dragon Ball Z, Hitman Reborn, Naruto, Naruto Shipuden, and many more) South Park, Smallville, How I Met Your Mother, The Simpsons, Family Guy, American Dad, Futurama, Family Matters, Full House, the Cleveland Show,WWE, Lucha Underground, sometimes TNA, Gotham, The Flash, Arrow, 3rd Rock from the Sun

Music:

I live in Orange County 

Grew up in Kansas Until I was 16 

I've lived in Arizona and NorCal 

I'm almost 25

My career and passion is in golf but I like to keep that to myself and have my love life separate from work 

I'm a nerd and a dork, I love dragon ball z and collecting Japanese toys and other memorabilia. I hope I can show you my drawings and collection. 

I have 6 tattoos
the band Yellowcard's logo, along with lyrics from their song ""Way Away"" (I'd love to tell you why I chose the lyrics I have, it's a deep meaningful story for me)

A bull to represent my grandfather who like me, was also a stubborn taurus

11 year old Gohan from the Cell Saga in Dragonball Z in his Super Saiyan 2 form

An astronaut to represent how as a kid I wanted to be the first person to hit a golf ball on mars, and to just never forget how small I am compared to everything else and not to let my ego get too big. 

and I also just have an awesome Tiger on my left arm. Tiger represents a lot of different things for me. 

I'm a big fan of Kansas sports teams 

Most of that stuff comes from being lonely and not having a lot of friends despite being likable I'm just not someone people like to be around because I'm always trying to be smarter and better at everything and it turns people off. I'm also kind of jaded I suppose by past relationships and never have a father figure so I've had to earn my way through life without any help so when I get criticized I can take it personally and it sucks. I would love to have a girlfriend who is able to soften me and give me someone to lean on. 

I've started to accept that I've been too hard-nosed at first with girls so this is me trying to open up so that I can find a girl that will give me a real chance, and get me excited to date again. 

This doesn't mean I'm going to be excited to the girls who just email me with a ""hey what's up"" because I'm not. This is who I am basically, if you like it and want to know more and my origin story along with who I want to be, that's what I want to be able to talk about on a date, not online anymore.

I hope one of you understands :)

if you don't want to text me you can Kik me at : kscaliforniaboy

Hi my name is Killian. I am looking for friends. Hopefully a friend who I can make a great connection with. I am definitely in need of someone to share happy, sad, and fun moments with. 

A little bit about myself- I am a trans masculine. I am a little kid at heart. I enjoy anything Disney. I am a huge huge Pokemon fan. I also enjoy video games. Most kinds at least. I also do enjoy ""feminine"" things. Only reason I quotation that is because I do not believe things that are considered feminine have any real basis in gender specifications. So if you like make up and clothes or anything of that nature please still feel free to get to know me! I also am very opinionated and I try my hardest to be knowledgable. I believe I am smart and I do enjoy intellectual conversations. I like to sketch sometimes and do other crafty things. I LOVE animals! With an extreme passion!

Also I am 23 but age is not necessarily a big deal to me. Please feel free to send me an email and we can exchange numbers and what not. I am looking forward to meeting a potential new friend =) Plus I have a significant other so please do not message me looking for anything more than friends.

* I am a good listener, and a great friend, I can make you laugh, listen to what you have to say, and be flirty, and fun towards you. Who knows, maybe you might even enjoy my company and we can both become friends.
&maybe even something more :) &
+It would be cool if you could just be your self and I could be mine, so we don't have to try to fake like we are something we're not, you know?
+Hopefully we can keep it real together, since I am very accepting. I definitely DO NOT discriminate from
xxxRace, Age, Hobbies, Music, Interests and ways of living.xxx

I am a musician, I have been playing live and touring with bands since I was 15, so music is a big part of my life. I love Every type of music but I'm mostly a rocker kid at heart :)

I work, currently in the film industry very temporarily so I'm not anything too special. 

I live with my best friend and love animals and just nice people. 

Well that's a little bit about me please share something about yourself also. I would love to get to know you.

Hello to all,
Why is it that trying to find a cool female on here is like Job Searching:)??? I'm pretty patient though Trust me. You have to have some type of patience on here because there is tons of spam, females on some other shit selling stuff:) and just females looking for a Sugar daddies. I'm not knocking the hustle, just saying you gotta have patience on here due to hella flakes. But enough of that, I'm 37yrs young, I live in the L.A. area, very respectful, honest, drama free, employed, mobile, and really hoping to find a female that's tired of playing games/wasting time and wants a LTR. I'm not just looking for sex or a one time fling, I'm basically really for the next woman to be the last. For real!!! I work 6 days and really looking for that bestfriend that could lead to a LTR in due time. Love going to Hermosa beach and Manhattan beach in the evenings after work sometimes and have a drink at a bar/restaurant and watch the Sunset or just walk around. Rare guy here that's super chill, easy to please, and just wanna be happy;) I really miss being in a committed relationship without the drama and BS but I'm pretty confident in my search:) Wish me Luck Ladies, Lol 
BTW, Race, Age, Weight, Height, & Religion doesn't matter. 
Good Luck to All in Life and in your Search;) Take Care ladies;)

What's up guys, I'm creating this post in hopes of connecting with some other like-minded individuals (or maybe not, if you want to debate with someone with differing perspectives i'm down) that are interested in general intellectual progressivism, but specifically participate in or are interested in the fields of or related to: Atheism, Anti-Theism, Anarchism, Anarcho-Syndicalism, Altruism/Selflessness, Existentialism, Existential Nihilism, Philosophy, Veganism, Human Rights, Animal Rights, Feminism, Pacifism, Ecologism, Anti-Establishment/Corporatism/Capitalism, basic equality, and generally changing the way we see things... 
These are the main causes I can think of off the top of my head, so really people who are open-minded, kind, displeased with popular American/national outlook and sociopolitical norms, displeased with current political state, and interested in seeking truth and the best answers through reasoning and rational thinking.
People with philosophical ideas based in rationale and possibly pursuing writing on these subjects.
People that are focused in socialism, communism, Marxism and other forms of government and economic policy i'd like to talk to too. Especially cool if you have or plan on taking direct action to combat problems.

Not sure if craigslist is really the place to look for people like this lol, but it seems the only other places would be punk concerts and universities, which are both easily hit or miss situations... And vegan restaurants too would work. I guess.
I'm also interested in art: 2d, sculpture, music, film, street art, tagging. My favorite music genres are sludgecore, crust punk, powerviolence, anarcho-punk, doom metal, conscious and hardcore hip-hop, reggae, soul, indie and a lot more, genres related to these I probably like. Pretty depressed music and movies are my favorites: City of God, Gummo, Kids, gang movies. Emotional, meaningful art of all kinds I'd likely enjoy.

As of now I want to establish a base so maybe in the future, friendships, possibly art collectives, housing co-ops, or other stuff can bud from this... I honestly don't know... 
So, if you're interested in any of these things, hit me up at my cell, texting's cool but if you can't I'll probably answer a call. We could talk over text or online or meet in person. I live in the 562 area but I can probably travel. If you email me put CRAIGSLIST in the Subject please, my email is oversaturated with notifications.
show contact info

(I'll link my FB to people interested)
You don't really have to be into any of these though of you feel we could still be cool. These really just set a preliminary idea.

If you think any of these things are cool, don't hesitate to hit me up.
Also, if you've got a minute plan, please email me instead of texting, I know them shits are expensive.

Tired of seeing all those TV shows (i.e. Burgers, Bru and Que, or Diners, Drive-Ins and dives). Lets put a group together and find out for ourselves, I am tired of seeing Guy Fieri stuff his face with what we should be eating (lucky dog). Well, if he has done the scouting lets do the eating start here in LA and move east, north and south. Won't be easy but how much could a burger cost? And we wont live forever so let's go for it. We are at the renaissance of burger heaven (ya even the high end places have burgers now). Not looking for some guy or gal just some friends to savor in America's finest hour and we can throw in some fries or onion rings to round things out. Beer is optional (or is it?), time is running out so e-mail me and lets get a strategy together. Outside of great burgers there are great friends so let us behold the adventure!

I am seeking a live-in position for elderly man or woman (or couple). I am a 48 year old female, single, no children. I'm educated, healthy, and strong. I'm also very easy to get along with, fun, energetic, and reliable. I'm a U.S. born citizen, speak fluent English, and possess excellent written and verbal skills. I have a valid driver's license, excellent driving record, and my own vehicle. I also have some medical training, as I went to nursing school, but quit due to breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. After I finished treatment, I no longer wanted to pursue a career in the medical field. I can explain that in more detail later, if you're interested. I can cook healthy meals, shop for groceries and supplies, drive to appointments and events, as well as take care of pets, and do light housekeeping.

Immediately after my treatment, I became a professional makeup artist and photographer, and owned my own business for the next 12 years (I also did this type of work while in school, along with my caregiver/companion/aide duties). I ran that business until 3 months ago, and due to the loss of my lease, I lost the building and the business. I have been a live-in caregiver and aide ever since. I am currently working with a large family near Palm Springs, and I am not happy here (I don't like being so far away from my neighborhood). We have an informal agreement, and I can leave anytime. I am very anxious to find another family/couple/single in my normal neighborhood, which is Toluca Lake (I lived in Toluca Lake for 17 years, and I miss it terribly). I will not consider any other neighborhoods besides Toluca Lake or Burbank.

During my schooling, I worked as a part-time caregiver for an elderly gentleman who was disabled. I worked for him for a few years until he passed away from complications of his paralysis. My duties included dressing him, lifting him into his chair, aiding in the restroom, bathing, and lots of driving. I did some cooking and cleaning, but mostly accompanying him to his family and social events. I was also responsible for getting him to and from his home on Catalina Island. He also had a very large home in Bel Air/Palisades, and I had my own private quarters although I did not live there full-time. 

Although I am not a licensed nurse or aide, I am still an excellent caregiver and companion. I can oversee/administer medication, maintain basic health and hygiene, and provide companionship, meals, and rides to and from errands. I have a lot of experience with the needs of seniors, and I am an excellent listener and friend. I love art/museums, music, and classic film. I am the perfect solution for someone who does not need a full-time nurse, but instead just needs someone to look after their daily needs, and keep them company. 

I do have a cat, and I am a smoker (who's genuinely trying to quit), but I will not ever smoke in anyone's home. I am a private person and keep to myself, unless I am asked to be present as part of my duties. I wake very early, and I am a very hard worker, and absolutely am NOT lazy. I do not have a social life, nor do I have a boyfriend that would distract me from my duties. I was 100% dedicated to my business before I lost my building, and I hope to get that business back eventually. 

So if you or someone you know could use someone like me, let's talk. We may or may not be a good fit, but it never hurts to discuss it!

I like to party, I like to listen to music and have a great time. Electronic music is good, but typical EDM parties aren't always the best environment, they don't last as long as they should, and sometimes they're too crowded. There are better and more underground scenes out there.

Smaller parties with less people that last longer are much more enjoyable. People say they want to stay up and party all night but rarely there are those who actually do. If you're looking to party and have the time of your life, then we should talk. If you're tired of boys who can't keep up, look no further.

If you want a truly psychedelic experience, you came to the right place.

Hi there. 

Sometimes, you just need a witty text, good conversation, or funny picture to break up the monotony of being at work/school all day. After a particularly long day, a good drink is the best way to unwind.

If you agree with those statements, you might just be my new friend!

I'm looking for friends to text while I'm at work and maybe hang out after or on days off. I'm also getting into Snapchat thanks to one of my friends from school, so if you use it, it's a plus.

Quick paragraph about me: I'm 25, light-skinned Latino, on the bigger side. I'm in a relationship, no kids. I work part-time (2-3 days a week) and I just went back to school. I drink socially, rarely smoke cigarettes/420, and just got into vaping. Not into drugs or partying. I like hanging out in Downtown LA, going to bars, trying new restaurants, and going on long drives. I enjoy the outdoors, whether it's the beach, mountains, or desert, and I like road trips. I have a Disney pass, so I go there often. In my downtime, I like hanging out with friends, reading, listening to music, going to the movies, and watching Netflix on occasion. 

If you're interested in getting to know each other, feel free to reply to my post with a little about yourself, what you're looking for, and a picture if you so choose.

Hope to hear from you soon!

P.S. if you speak Spanish, hit ""reply"" right now! lol. I'm a native Spanish speaker who hasn't spoken it much for years, so I'd like someone to practice with.

Hello, my name is Kevin and I am a traveling photographer who will be driving to the Southern part of California for approximately 10 days at the end of this month. If possible I'm trying to find a couple, woman, or man who has a spare room or couch for a well mannered, polite, ex-military, artist to stay on while in town. I'm southern raised where manners and respect are everything so I respect personal and house rules and privacy very well. I will be coming into town on April 22nd and leaving on May 2nd, and aside from going to San Francisco the 25th-26th I'll be in the LA area for personal work the rest of the time. I have shoots from Malibu to Newport/Crystal Cove so I will be out and about quite a bit, but I don't need much space, I travel light, and I am always well behaved. I do not smoke, drink, or do any sort of drug, I have no criminal past aside from one ticket for doing donuts in snow at my old high school a decade ago, and would be happy to help with cleaning or house chores in exchange for a safe place to stay.

I am a 27 years old, male, 6'1""-6'2"", 180lbs athletic, facial hair, blue eyes, brown hair, a couple tattoos that area easily hidden while wearing a shirt, I have worked in the fields of robotics, military, law enforcement, and currently the graphic arts.

If this is something you would be open to I would be extremely grateful and happy to hear from you, hopefully this will also be a way to make some new friends from half way across the country from my home here in Kansas City, Missouri.

Please put ""Available host"" in the subject line so I know you're not spam mail and please let me know what you're willing/able to do and any rules or requests if I were able/to stay with you. Thank you and happy Sunday.

I like to experience new restaurants being a foodie, bars, lounges, and clubs to dance and drink with friends/co workers but haven't had a chance lately, I'm a car guy so that means I like to take spontaneous drive/road trips/travel.

Greetings, G'day

Aussie Russian Frenchy here who is looking for a new pal. Hoping to meet someone for all sorts of endeavours from errands to walking and hiking to gaming to anything pals do. Someone to text/chat and later hang about with. I'm here for a few months helping a mate. I used to live in LA before though. Moved fro Australia age 13 and went to HS in Rancho. After HS I went back to Australia, France, UK and the PNW. Went back to UK and now here helping a mate. Close friends are far away and the loneliness is a bit of a drag. I'd want to meet new folks out and about but lately it's been pretty difficult for some reason. What the hell is it with people being so into themselves ey? Maybe it's just be but that is what I see. So I thought that I would give this a go even though I've tried making mates thru digital means only to end in weird failure. Flaky folks seemed to be the theme of the people I've chatted with. Right then, well I'm a good mate who believes friendship is something to cherish. In fact real friendship is bloody marvelous. I'm happy yet sad, you wouldn't know when the sad is about so don't worry if you think I'm a downer as I'm not. Rebel yet mellow, dark with light. I'm 29, athletic, sporting piercings, ink, and the attire ranges. I could be wearing a sport jacket with jeans or cargos, DCs, t and a hoodie (the norm for me). I travel heaps with a broad range of interests as well. As before I listed heaps of them here but now I will only name a few. Hiking, travel, listening to music (everything almost, from jazz and classical to the 70s, 80s and 90s punk. World tunes to electronica, indie, alternative, classic and modern rock etc etc blah blah) and creating it (love mixing eletronica and absolutely hate calling is EDM). I create electronica and love playing me didge, and piano. Vehicle related things as I'm a petrol head, being nostalgic, sitting on roofs, looking for E.T.s, chatting on about space, snow/skateboarding, reading, filming and photographing the world, helping folks and driving around listening to indie and going into your own world. Been a night owl lately so it can be a bit lonely. I'm looking for a good friend, easy as that, proud as punch. Not a friend on short term basis either. A friend for the ages. A GOOD MATE. Can't be to difficult to find that? I dunno perhaps it can.... Age range of friends is a pretty broad one. I know good people that I'm proud as punch to call mates ranging from 18 to 80s. If you're looking for a good friend as well, sit on a roof somewhere and just look at the view, talk and be proper mates, then please, send me a reply. Does not matter if you are tall short square round black white gay straight etc etc etc. Love ya all! I PREFER to chat thru kik, whatsapp, text or actual phone conversation and not so much email.. A few initial emails are OK however it seems that there are way too many flakes and bots thru email. Take care,
Ta!

Let's try this again. When I ran a similar ad recently I got answers from women in their 40s and 50s who thought I was looking for a mistress. I am not.

I am an old man, in good shape, hwp. I have been widowed for many years after a long marriage. I am not looking for love much less for a wife or live-in companion (or mistress). What I am seeking is a sensual, friendly relationship with an age-appropriate woman. I crave physical contact - hugs, strokes, cuddling. This is not the same as looking for sex. Whether it goes in that direction would only be by mutual choice and after some time.

The essence of the relationship I seek is a mutual desire for warm, comforting physical contact. Whether we find other interests in common, like music, movies, art, books, hiking, would remain to be seen. We might be very compatible physically and have nothing else in common. Or maybe we would. In any event, I am not offering or at this point in my life emotionally capable of being in a marriage-like arrangement so if that is your long-term goal I am not your man.

You should be at least 60 years old. Please do not answer this ad if you are younger! There is no upper age limit as long as you are in touch with your physical need for human contact. I have no restrictions as to your race or ethnicity. (I am white.) Within limits, I have no preferences as to your physical type. (I would draw the line at what is called SSBBW in CraigsList-ese.) The women who have been important in my life have ranged from skinny to Rubenesque; their shape has not been one of the most important things about any of them.

I live alone in downtown LA. I can host or travel. We could arrange a first meeting someplace public for coffee or a drink. I would like this to happen soon. Since I am retired I am free much of the time.

If you reply please put CONTACT as the subject to weed out CL spam and scams. If you reply I will respond with my name, photos, and phone / text #.

Hello!

I am a fun, educated and sensitive man who is having a tough time in his marriage..

It's really getting me down, and I think that I would like to find a like minded married woman for some strictly platonic giggles. 

It would be fun to go to museums, grab a coffee.. basically to have a friend who understands.

And yes.. I am an optimist (though fully aware that no-one will likely answer my plea)!

So, I'm.. well I suppose I'm young, but I feel quite a bit older. Things that happen you know. I go around in a blue... you know it doesn't really matter. 

Basically, I'd love nothing more than to find someone to go out and experience new and fun things with. Disney perhaps, but there's better things out there, mountains and deserts and far off places. I suppose I'd be a madman with a blue box out for adventure. 

So, if you understood that last bit, and you're interested, let me know. I'm out and about, and I'll get back to you. Time's funny that way. You think it's there and then it's not. Really it's like a wibbly-wobbly... oh nevermind, just post a response and we can chat.

I'm easing into the world of healthy eating, but I'm mystified by how to cook with the vast majority of vegetables. Most of my meals consist of sad-looking salad and over-steamed asparagus.

This is where you come in.

If you're a happy vegan and you know your way around a plant-based recipe or two, maybe you can teach me? I'm sitting on a cache of fresh ingredients, and I have a great kitchen with modern appliances and prep tools; I'm just missing the know-how.

Perhaps we can make dinner. And friends. (clever, right?)

I'm attaching a pic of one of the rare veg dishes that I'm actually proud of. It was green beans, broccoli, beet greens and golden beet root.

Hi CL!

After surfing this casual encounter section for the past few weeks now, I've decided to finally post!

To start off, I've noticed that there are a lot of ""bots"" and ""spammers"" on this website, so I'd like to let you know that I'm completely real.

About me -- I'm 21 years old, and currently a senior at one of the universities in Los Angeles. I was born and raised near San Gabriel, and grew up here in the city. I'm educated, smart, well-dressed, confident but not cocky, and funny. I love watching movies and TV shows, to playing video games, to reading books, to finding the best places to eat. 

While I'm looking for a FWB, I'd love to also find someone that I don't mind ""grabbing a beer with."" I'm 100% not looking for a relationship, but I would prefer that we get along intellectually and that we're able to have a conversation. I'm looking for someone who's not afraid of the ""friend"" in FWB, someone who's down to watch a movie or grab a cup of coffee on any given day.

Sexually, I'm pretty inexperienced. To be upfront, I've been with two people in my 21 years of life. I do prefer giving more than receiving, but that might be because I've never really experienced a great blowjob? Nonetheless, I love being between a girl's legs. Giving someone pleasure is definitely more fun than being on the receiving end.

Physically, I'm Asian, ~5'8, and athletic. From years of swimming, I've gained broad shoulders. I love to stay physically fit, and I do work out around 4 times per week. I don't smoke or do any drugs, drink recreationally, and have no weird piercings or tattoos. 

Ideally, you are older than 18 and fun to be around! I love people who are humorous and know how and when to crack a great joke. I'm attracted to women who are smart and confident, a la ""lady in the street but a freak in the bed."" I'm open to any race and any race. Please practice safe sex, and be disease free! 

Kink wise, I'm still pretty new to everything. I've mostly experienced ""vanilla"" sex, so I'm open to trying out new kinks. We can talk about this! :)

If you fit the above, I'd love to hear from you! Send me a message that describes who you are and what you're looking for. Want a quicker reply? Send me a photo!

Thanks for reading and I hope to hear from you soon :)

to be upfront, I'm looking for someone who's interested in being my mistress / lover. 

someone who finds it a huge turn on knowing that they're ""better"" than my current girlfriend I've been with for two years. someone who gets off on knowing that I'll think of how much better they are while I'm with my girlfriend. 

this sort of relationship might not suit everybody, but if it's something that appeals to you, I'd love to hear back from you! maybe you're single, or also in a relationship yourself - it doesn't matter!

I'm 21 years old, Asian, from Pasadena, and fit. I'm DD Free, and expect you to be the same as well.

No requirements on age (i think it'll be great if you're older!), and no preferences on race. I'll like you to be fit / in shape as well.

relationship is NSA, and if preferred, let's use fake names like we're spies 😎

Hello Men - I am seeking a good buddy to hang and do things with. 
I am 52 yo masc bear single successful busy and yet lonely for a good friend. 
My best friend of 14 years met someone online and has since moved to DC so I now find myself missing him and feeling very lonely for companionship.
We would hang on weekends whether one of us had a lover or relationship or not. 
We were just good friends, we fooled around a few times but not to where it would be awkward to still be friends. He had a key to my house and was welcome to come over any time he wanted. 
We would get naked smoke 420 and hang in my private pool or jacuzzi look for fuck buds together movies cards board games flea markets events outings concerts or just rent a convertible and take off on any given weekend just to getaway and experience new things. 
I miss him soooooo much and I doubt I could ever replace him but that being said, i am seeking a new friend to hang with and call my little buddy. 
Looks age etc not important. just be a good guy who is a good friend and be ok with getting naked or jerking off together - just hanging on weekends and having a great time. we would even sleep together at times. 
If you can relate and are looking for a good man to be friends with then please hit me up.
This is for real no flakes please and no bullshit - be an honest human being who knows how to laugh and have fun even if we never leave the house. 
Better if you are 420 friendly but not a big drinker as I don't drink at all i do smoke cigs also. 
I am not into the bar scene or the gay lifestyle and he wasnt either we were just two men who happen to be gay and became the best of friends. 

I am 52 yo 5 eleven three hundred pounds hairy masc bearded bellied and a really great guy with no issues and no time for drama. 
seeking a good honest friend for good times and bad one who will never deny me or me him and together we can enjoy life and times. 

if you can relate or are looking for a good buddy then please send me an email and put ""buddy"" in the subject line and include stats pics and what you like to do and we can take it from there. 

I have a private home and love to hang here and do home projects and get naked and enjoy my private yard pool spa etc. if you want to join me then let me know and lets become buddies. 

I am open to all types as this is a friendship deal and not a marriage proposal. 
please no other drugs then 420 no addicts no fems and no bullshit.

So I got back into gaming earlier this year and my Steam friend list is looking pretty barren. Searching for someone to play with and just shoot the breeze in general. I have loads of games (I can't say no to sale) and a pretty broad taste as well, though I prefer RPGs and indie games. I should mention that I'm not much into MMOs anymore, nor MOBA as I don't get into competitive gaming.

Should make it pretty clear that I'm not from anywhere nearby so this isn't a subtle ploy to hook up or any other creepy shit. I don't care if you're married or partnered or whatever, I just want some gaming buddies. 

S'pose it's customary to put a little about me here: I'm 33 and single. Gainfully employed. Open minded, good sense of humor. Obviously enjoy gaming a great deal, and other activities that involve sitting down. Reading, watching movies, listening to music. We can exchange emails (or whatever) a bit as well if you prefer. The internet is a weird place and I'm sure you'd like to confirm I'm mostly harmless and not gonna bombard you with pictures of my dick in a little top hat or something. Though you might get a lot of pictures of my cat. He's a silly sailor. But anyway, if any of this strikes you feel free to drop me a line.

TL;DR - Looking for Steam friends.

To whom it may concern,

There is nothing in life so essential, so healing, and as irreplaceable as the power of the human touch is there? Whatever your intention please have an open heart and mind. Be prepared to let go of yourself and disappear into the press of our bodies together allowing each other to nurture and caress or just held. 

I offer you my caring touch. As you surrender into my arms and masculinity, you are reminded you that you are amazing.

I invite you to surrender and be vulnerable to be more fully in that place where you will be held in my compassionate presence. Muscles are relaxed and tension melts away to prepare the body and mind to liven the spirit.

If this is something that interests you please respond. I will provide a pic upon request. I am by no means a stud but I am not unattractive or lack chemistry I am intelligent, respectful and passionate but know that boundries exist I am not seeking to make you feel uncomfortable at all.

I am an artist at heart. In the interests of honesty, I am seven years sober. I certainly indulged in every variety of drugs & alcohol over a wild partying career, so I have no judgements of anyone's habits.

I love women of all races, shapes and types, petite, voluptuous, dark, light. Anyone with a twinkle in their eye, a lust for life, a spark of passion, is a friend of mine. 

I enjoy intelligent open minded discussion by email, text, telephone, or up close and personal. I love nature, animals, all arts, cuddling, artistic foreplay and wild animal sex, in no particular order. 

I am single and open to ANYTHING! Feel free to share your personal passions and pleasures. Tell me what you want! We can be pen pals, chat buds, or connect however we find mutually convenient.

In some ways I am happily single and certainly patient. However I wake up every day with morning wood and wonder what a few play mate would be like? Or a no strings, casual encounter? 

I will gladly reply with additional honest physics description, and send photos. I would love to see yours and to hear your honest thoughts and feelings. Meanwhile, enjoy a wildly colorful life.

Hey! I'm just your regular guy that works 40 hours a week and gets the weekends off.. Usually after work, I go home and play video games and smoke, then walk around till it's time for dinner then shower, then sleep and do it all over again the next day... I'm booooored. 

I'm not desperate, just bored.. So if you're looking for a sugar daddy, look elsewhere. I'm actually looking for a friend that can contribute to life every day necessities. I think I'm so lazy cause I don't have anyone to go do stuff with. Maybe if I had someone to do things with, Id do more.. It's not just the doing stuff.. It could also be sharing a meal.. it's so hard to cook for one person. Or maybe just shopping for our weekly goods.. it would be nice to do normal everyday stuff with someone I get along with.

I have to mention again that this is for a girl/friend not a GF. I am not an ugly guy and if I wanted a GF I could easily have one. I am an attractive guy that attracts women who are usually ready to settle down. Or women with kids looking for a daddy.. Or women that are looking for a way out of their slum.. Those women don't interest me. I am not gonna save you, unless your burden is also boredom like me.

I am fit. I like to go to the park and ride my bike, or I'll walk and walk and walk for miles. I eat healthy mostly but I'm not a health freak. I eat meat. Um.. I'm not very picky, I mean this is just as ad for friends, but you still have to be able to keep up. That's the main thing, you need to keep up. If I decide one day to ride a skateboard on the boardwalk in Hermosa beach, I would like to be able to invite you along. Things of that nature that require some physical activity and plenty of sunlight are my favorite. 420 and good movie is also fun too ;)

Who wants to go ghost hunting with me? I love going out and searching for the unknown..

I used to do it all the time. going into spooky places, feeling the chill down your spine and the crawling of your skin when you see shadows moving across the hall, and hearing creepy sound. It makes your heart skip a beat. This is not for the faint of heart or those with a bad ticker..

I prefer female buddies as it gives me someone to talk about the experience. You should have a digital camera and a flashlight with extra batteries as sometimes the spirits drain the charge. This is no joke! You must have a sense of adventure. Also bring a recorder (some phones have this feature) to record EVP's..

I prefer non-smokers as it is very distracting and can foul up the smells you may pick up from the past. The lucky lady needs to be over 18 with proof as we are usually out very late.

If you love Chlorophyll Kid, Color Kid, Dream Girl, Fire Lad, Night Girl, Polar Boy, Star Boy, and Stone Boy, I'd like your input. I'm writing 13 scripts for a live-action summer TV series entitled Special Unit Bodyguards (aka SUBs).

In my version the Legion of Super-Heroes and the SUBs are adults, which the Science Police and United Planets would take far more seriously. Also, Saturn Woman suggests to RJ Brande that he should hire the SUBs since he might use their powers for his company's benefits. Also, Night Woman and Stone would make great bodyguards.

The series would be a family show with the Legionnaires and SUBs wearing their silver-age costumes. It will also be a bit of a throw back to both the Challenge of the Super Friends and Josie and the Pussycats in outer space. Dreamer foresees the team having adventures on different worlds where they will battle different villains like the Fatal Five, the Taurus Gang, and the Legion of Super-Villains.

If you fanboys want to learn more, please contact me. Thanks.

not exactly your thing? I can relate-but it would be nice to have a local friend/companion for occasional daytime activity such as music, museum, art show, or lunch. For example, there is a May 1 art show at La Chene that might be fun to see-maybe w/lunch [I'll pass on the escargots though.] You could even bring an energy bar if unsure of such a heavy commitment. I took early med retirement at age 60 so I'm leaning to someone within a few decades to facilitate conversation. Be good if we're on similar page re the historical, cultural, pop references from the late sixties to now. I esp relate to former teachers, therapists, nurses anyone sharp with or without college degree. 2/3 of my degrees are from CSUN and I was a 30 yr teacher/counselor for LAUSD. Folks who favor Trump, Cruz, Rubio or other ultra-conservative GOP types pls ignore this post. I lean to Progressive even Libertarian causes/candidates-which equates to Bernie this election cycle. I supported Hillary and Obama in the past but my patience for corporations owning/running govt is long gone. Christians ok as long as you don't proselytize, recruit or pray for me. I designed and built my own [w/c friendly]home near Magic Mtn; if you're close by-near Hasley, Hillcrest, Old Rd, 5/126 pls step up to meet a new friend. I've done over a dozen marathons, countless 10 ks, won trophies/awards in tennis, road racing and other sports but I'm slowing down to pursue more sedentary events like gardening, home imp and cooking. I have a huge and diverse cookbook collection-would love to make u Fri or Sat early eve dinner. I have a foto on facebook, 812 credit score but I don't do church except on very special occasions. Love to discuss current events. politics, pop culture- just need a local friend. My relatives and best friends are gone-geographically or physically. So, if u like the Getty, summer concerts, Thai, Indian Mexican food or sushi, bbq, Green Thumb nursery or occasional glass of vino while listening to oldies/rock/pop, Motown, Dylan, beatles, Clapton, rem, u2 etc pls take a chance-send me a note looking forward 2 mtg new local friend!

Hello. So my boyfriend got mad at me last week. On Saturday he told me he was ""bothered"" and needed space. I told him that was fine. So it has been one week and he has not contacted me. It's killing me not to call him! But I know if I do that, it's only going to push him away more. But honestly, how much of this space does he need? He's 36, I'm 31. We've been together about 3 years.

Thank you :)

Un-Married - Single and Available...I'm truly looking for a meaningful, honest, and respectful monogamous relationship...never just ""a one night stand.""

Let's chill and relax, and CUDDLE in our underwear. :-) at your place. Invite me over if you're interested and we can chat and relax. I'm very recently single, so not looking for anything sexual, etc. Especially and at least not at the onset. HMU, bros and let's go from there. 

Please be local: NoHo, Burbank, studio city, universal city, studio city hills, sun valley, valley village, valley glen, Van Nuys, Panorama City, Sherman Oaks, Pacoima, Arleta, Cahuenga Pass, Griffith Park. LMK, dudes. You can be gay (I'm very masc gay myself) straight, str8, bi, as long as you're a super cool guy.

Hi, it would be cool to meet people that enjoy searching/reading about spirituality such as new age ideas about auras, and consciousness. It's been hard to make new friends because of my introvert personality. That's why I only have a couple of close friends. But, lately they've been busy with things going on in their lives. I'm really only looking for female friends that are open minded to talk about anything from what we're going through and do simple fun activities such as go to the movies, beach, dancing/clubbing or grab coffee and walk at a park. Someone local would be ideal and around 22-30. I would like to make friends close by to the areas of: East Los Angeles, Downey, Southgate, Downtown LA, Bell Gardens, Montebello, Monterrey Park, Los Feliz, Echo Park, Huntington Park, City of Terrace Central Los Angeles, and Mid-City. I prefer this locations because it's hard hanging out when the distance is far. If you can tell me a little about yourself with a picture and I'll do the same. I'm straight by the way, I would prefer someone straight also because I know this is craigslist. Hope you have a nice day and best wishes with other posts.

Hi, 

I'm 29, and live on the westside. I realize that I don't have a close circle of girlfriends in LA anymore, most of them have moved away or are married and I really miss having them. I think I'm just a nice, normal girl. I'm NOT a huge partier, but I like to have fun. I like the beach, love to get drinks, go out to eat, hiking, outdoors etc I would love to make close friends on the Westside of LA who are close in age and compatible in interests and lifestyle as me. I'm not wealthy by any means, but can afford to go to restaurants, and do things. My biggest pet peeve with friends has to be flakiness and over dramatic girls. I'm pretty down to earth, loyal, and ambitious. If you think we could be good friends please send me a message with a similar bio.

Hey guys and gals, 

I just got my professional badge for San Diego Comic Con this year and I'm really looking forward to going, but I couldn't find anyone to go with. I don't have friends into this kinda stuff (lame, right?) and I was thinking as a Hail Mary I would see if anyone attending maybe wants to get to know each other and maybe hang out at the con. I'm really there for all the great comic panels, seeing all the great writers, artists and whatnot (not into the whole hall h fiasco) and of course I love shopping the floor and going to any of the other awesome panels I can get into. I love pop culture, movies, tv, books and obviously comics. I have other interests too, but we can talk about all that if you're interested in getting to know me, right? 

Anyway, I'm a 28 year old female if that means anything and I'm strictly (as this section suggests) looking for friends, but I've probably already doomed myself to a million dick pics just by posting here. So if you or your group of welcoming friends are open to a new buddy then send me a message!

This is an ad not for sex, but for some intimacy. I miss the warmth of having muscular arms wrapped around me. Admittedly, I feel a little lonely as well. Broke up with my BF 6 months ago and I am still trying to get over him. Maybe you are going through something similar? We can help each other heal or at least keep company?

Im here in search for one new friend. Im looking for someone chill, down to earth, honest, non party animal, deep thinker, who enjoys the lil simple things in life and admires nature. 
Preferably someone in her late 20s to early 30s. I dont mind if you do 420 . To each their own. Im not much of a drinker btw lol Oh and also I hope this is no deal breaker but I hope I find someone who uses molly on few occasions to relax and take mind off of things not really for party purposes. Ideally I'd like to establish a real friendship and be able to hang out whenever our schedule allows us. 

Anyway, this is a real post. Please no fakes or hidden agendas. Voice verify will be requested. This is strictly platonic! 

Until then.....chao! :)

Hello. I am someone who likes classical music and theater. People need to escape from the negative energy of the world. Doing so does not have to be a life-changing event, either. Having someone to talk to is wonderful. Being alone all the time is depressing.

Hey there. Or alternatively, as we say back east, ""Peace."" Heh. I keep mentioning my roots, but to level with you I've lived in L.A. on and off for years. I'm visiting a friend in Glendale(fyi, I'm Italian and German, not Armenian, lol). They have an impromptu accounting contract they're working on this afternoon, so that means I'm free-floating on my own for the remains of the day. 

Having had more than my fill of the Americana and Galleria over extended periods of time, I thought I'd head out here for the afternoon and see what kind of mischief I can get into. Looking for a partner in crime(getting tipsy) - you game?

And now for a few things you should know before you respond:

I'm 6'1"", a former bodybuilder who suffered a rotator cuff tear a year ago, so while I haven't worked out since then and indeed am ever so slightly stocky, I still have a decidedly muscular/athletic look. I would say unless you're strictly looking for a ripped dude, I will be decent enough to look at. I myself personally prefer fuller-figured but nothing sloppy in a woman's build, very feminine and a full face of make-up absolutely. No tomboys. 

I'm a bit coarse in my NYC-esque manliness and need a delicate little flower to properly balance out my surly/brawny energy. I probably look like a jock, but as it turns out I have the intellect to go along with it, so do not be fooled by the meathead look.

In a similar vein, and in being a tried and true city boy, to be perfectly clear, I am not paying your way today. 

Why? Firstly because this is L.A. 

Secondly because it's not 1950 anymore and I don't throw money at random strangers.

As an aside, the true alpha males don't need to resort to such things in order to garner the fairer sex's company. In other words, don't be broke, be independent enough to pay your own way, and show me you are of the quality ilk I'm seeking by not being a scheming little tramp. 

Seems pretty fair and reasonable in today's sordid world I'd say. Fair that is, to everyone except the scheming little tramps out there, lol.

Straight up - let's hang out girl. I definitely am a lot of fun, not looking to go to bed, and just would dig some chill company today. You want to swoon? Do you deserve such charm and grace? If yes, I shan't disappoint.

Above all else, don't be a kid. Secondly, don't think a cute face is enough. In my unique case, it's not. My rivers run concertedly deeper. I am seeking an element much harder to find than a nice smile.

Someone humble, well-mannered, emotionally open, and without 10 walls up. In short I need a real human being. Not a typically catty prima donna L.A. clone. 

If you are true quality you will be treated like gold. My word on that. -winks-

As another aside, I am a freelance web content writer and work exclusively and full-time from my laptop. I am not a plastic, sheltered, foofy person. I am blue-collar and highly mature by nature. I don't care if you work as an executive for a corporation or at the local diner as a waitress. A person is defined by their actions, not their career. Hopefully you -get- that. Only the wiser ones truly will I'd surmise.


Anyway, I'll be out here for about the next 5 hours or so, so if you can get out here or live close and don't mind walking(smartest option, trust), text me a picture and we'll catch up with each other in just a bit somewhere in Burbank. Maybe grab a bite, get a drink, who knows. We'll play it by ear.


In closing, everything above you've just read is as accurate as humanly possible. No tricks, no games, no lies. Make sure you present yourself in a similar manner is all I really ask. Much appreciated.


See you soon, 

DOMINICK

I've been trying to make a platonic friend here for a while. It isn't easy, and I think a part of the problem is that people have different interpretations of the word ""platonic"". That being said, I think a good way to go about actually making a truly platonic friend is to put everything up front.

To me a platonic friend has absolutely no romantic intentions at all. I want to find a friend that is just that, and only that. Just someone to hang out with and do stuff with. I want to hang out wearing my shorts and a T-shirt, find a hole in the wall joint to eat at, grab some drinks at a chill bar, maybe play some pool, catch a movie, go shopping... keep everything down to earth. As friends only. This means that there will never ever be any possibility of hooking up, dating, ect. Just like it would be if I'm hanging out with my guy friends. 

As your male platonic friend, I can look under the hood of your car and pretend to know what's wrong with it. If we really hit it off, maybe I can help you move some heavy furniture some day. But, one step at a time.

In all seriousness, I would like to meet more people to chill with. I'm really into independent movies, and by independent, I mean movies where the director as the strongest voice in telling the story. Some of my favorite directors are Paul Thomas Anderson, Alexander Payne, Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu, Richard Linklater, Ang Lee, Kubrick... I don't watch sports very much, but I do like to play tennis and snowboard. Some of my other interests include cars, the internet, and economics. I'm not into politics at all. I'm not religious, but I like a lot of eastern philosophy and believe in karma.

LA can be a difficult place to make friends. There are tons of people here, so it seems like the value of an individual diminishes in the vast pool of people who reside here. Plus, everyone is so busy and it takes forever to get anywhere. But, despite these obstacles, it's worth whatever it takes to find the right friend. Nothing in this world is worth having if there isn't someone to share it with.

I'm Asian & 40

Good morning... recently, I have been looking at the ""strictly platonic"" ads on CL.. I am recently out of a year and nine month relationship...and before that a twelve year marriage. After my divorce I started to date women because I was scared to be alone... and In the process I hurt people along the way.. Its been 3 years since the divorce and about 4 months since the breakup and I would NOW LIKE TO MEET a kind, caring person to have a friendship with... Someone that I can talk to, and someone that would listen to you when u need someone to lean on. Someone I can give advice to, and someone I can ask advice for when I get confused, or lost. Im not afraid anymore, but there is still a long way to go to understand things for me. Now Im an architect and considered myself pretty intelligent.. but recently.. I have started to believe I don't know A LOT of things...that maybe by this time In life... I should. Im 38 and live in Downtown LA. My seventeen year old daughter lives with me. I am employed as an architect and have my life somewhat set in motion...but lately have just started to question a lot of the fundamental beliefs I was raised with. If any of this makes any sense... or maybe you may have some suggestions for me... or ideally, your a kind, caring, thoughtful soul and are also looking for a friend...someone real, considerate, kind, caring and compassionate... thats what I am looking for... Im not concerned with age, money, part of town. superficial exploits... Just a real human being. U can look my facebook up at Lawrence Garcia, Los Angeles. I have nothing to hide... and I have nothing to fear. And that was weird for me... ! lol. Have a good morning everyone... have a great day... and god bless..

im in a committed ltr, have a small circle of friends i've had since childhood, have a close and loving family, and am involved in the community... but i'm being fake with everyone... i need to find people i can really be myself with.. i'm very opinionated and driven to explore the meaning of life and such.. and those around me are satisfied with trudging through the game and being distracted with frivolous reptilian stimuli, but i love them so i act like i care about the pointless things they're interested in, act like im not disappointed with their lack of ambition, act like i love them for more than an emotional attachment. 
i want friends i can admire, who inspire me, who have challenged life and come through wiser. 
im a heathen. i do believe in a higher power... its called physics. energy and the spiritual self are very real.. but believing in a conscious entity is laughable, so i cant take believers seriously. its like a gown ass adult truly believing in the tooth fairy. its far more likely that our reality is a computer simulation.
i love animals. my passion is to better the lives of domestic pets. i aspire to be vegan, i recognize the health benefits, and im tired of wanting to cry every time i eat cheese and think of the video of the newly freed dairy cows prancing on grass for the first time in their lives. 
on the same note, i'm trying to break my food addictions... sugar, bad fats, processed foods, animal products.. 
i strongly believe in population control for many reasons. watch the 'idiocracy' intro for basic context. 
i dont use or condone the use of cosmetics of any kind. its needless exposure to toxins, needless expense, and contributes to global pollution... all for the sake of vanity (same goes for tattoos). skincare is important healthwise, but to play into a fictional standard of beauty is hindering social progress.

so yeah, those are some of the more controversial reasons why i cant be myself with those i care for the most. i can put up an act to get along, but i'm THIRSTY for intellectual company!! people who are striving to do better because they know better, even if doing better is a pain in ass. i know this isnt the best place to find that... but hey, if im on here, there might be some other jewel rolling around here too :)

I'm posting here, because what I seek fits the definition of platonic. I want to enjoy friendship, companionship, and not have sex.

This takes the pressure and expectations out of a craigslist posting. I'm not gay, impotent, or crazy. I just know the stuff that comes with intimacy and I'm not interested in dealing with the ""why didn't you call"" and ""I think we should move in together"" conversations that usually follow. Frankly, it's not worth it. I'd rather avoid the drama and emotional roller coaster that comes with dating.

If I want to have sex with a stranger, I know how to find it. This isn't my first rodeo! I want something different. Less impulsive. More permanent. 

I'd rather see a movie or grab a bite to eat with a friend than by myself. Most of my friends are married or in committed relationships. I decided to post on CL to see is anyone is open to hanging with an educated, respectful, and fun guy who wants to regularly get together, but isn't interested in dating. 

Here's my ""wish list"":
1. No addictions;
2. No crazy exes that will slash my tires or my throat;
3. No anger towards men (like your ex) that you will take out on me;
4. No lying from the start unless you're absolutely certain that I will never find out. If I find out later, no matter how small, I'll have trust issues. Friends don't lie to each other - except for how fabulous the dreadful haircut or outfit looks; and
5. No photos needed until we exchange a few emails. I didn't post one and I shouldn't demand one in return. That's only fair.

I didn't post age, race, height, or weight for a reason. It's not because I'm ugly. I'm not, but that's not the point. This is a platonic ad. 

Oh, and one final point. I'm happy to exchange emails with anyone who makes an effort to communicate. One liners will be read, and then deleted. Hookers, trannys, minors, and bots need not respond. No, I'm not joining a web verification site! No, I'm not looking to trade ""roses"" for your company. No, I'm not interested in being saved and attending Bible or Scientology classes with you.

It's really a very simple concept. Could you use another friend of the opposite gender? I could. I'm in the market. That's why I'm putting it out there. 

Please don't respond if you're looking to get married, or want to move in together and/or start a family. 

Please do respond if you're generally upbeat, you're interesting and interested, and you would rather spend time with someone from time to time than sit at home alone wondering why, in a City this large, you can't find someone who is polite, respectful, and who enhances your life. Maybe we're a match -- as friends who will enjoy spending quality time together.

Interested? You know what to do.

I'm using this platform because writing to an ambiguous reader makes it easier for myself to thread these thoughts into a cohesive whole. If I were to sit down and just think about what bothers me, I would end up going off the subject. On the other hands, the expectations of these words getting to you, ambiguous reader, give me some pressure to finish.

I thought this whole growing up thing would be easier. I got to this point in my life focused on the idea that making myself a ""better person"" would, in turn, make interesting people gravitate towards me. That's why I learned how to play drums, or the history of western philosophy, or how to comfortable express my thoughts without any insecurities. 

I try to speak from my heart, without reservations, and I expect the same from others. But this road of making myself ""better"" has only granted me solitude. In the effort to find those of you who like to communicate, I have mostly seen indifference, and apathy. As if life wasn't running around us, as if we didn't have a limited time to understand all of this, as if our chances to really connect, and discover the world through the eyes of others wasn't a precious opportunity, I see how the smallest effort to be vulnerable and open is treated as a sign of weakness. I wonder if I'm the only one that feels so lonely, and if it is really accepted that everyone talks about themselves in the same way. We all like the outdoors, we all like hiking, we all would like to be in better shape, we all like to travel. What else is left to say about us?

I have tried to keep up, and be a part of the trend: Ive been casual, and Ive been vulnerable, Ive been dominant, and submissive, Ive tried countless times to see if inside the shallow shells we put on there's a sign of any intention to strive for a deeper connection, but I haven't been lucky. I will, nonetheless, keep trying to find that person who likes long letters, and random walks.

Looking for someone to enjoy a half an hour walk at 6:30 AM a few mornings each week at Trumps Gold Course in Palos Verdes. Followed by coffee and sharing the newspaper at the Deli there. Please be at least 57 and well educated. We will go Dutch.. 

I am trying to lose some extra weight so hoping a couple extra walks a week will help. I am very fit otherwise as I hike about 12 miles most weekends and am very active gardening and with other sports. I work from my home near by (why I am interested in walking at Trumps) and have to be finished by 8AM most mornings. I am an animal lover, have a decent mind (Harvard Ph.D.), lean slightly left politically and enjoy art and music. I'm not looking for romance - just companionship for my walk and morning coffee and to make new friends. 

Please just respond if you are looking for a walking partner only and can show up at Trumps at 6:30AM a couple times a week. That's really all I am seeking. I posted this same ad with a w4w tag before and go no actual responses so I thought I would try w4m. But to be clear I am just seeking a walking partner.

Have you ever wondered why our humanity has become so sterile, lacking the will to engage with others? The human connection and the need to feel wanted is the most basic of needs.

What I'm looking for is simple, giving you the time to get to know me, in return I, you. Not asking for pre-requisites, accepting you for you!

Here is who I am; I'm a man with no hang-ups on appearances, My genuinely wanting to become your friend, at your pace and in the amount of sharing of one's self on a level that is must comfortable to you.
I love my life, what I do for a living, the person I've become, being considerate of others, genuinely caring for your feelings and not pushing my beliefs on you. 

Respecting your belief system and practices, without reservation or judgment. I'm not materialistic, shallow, fair whether friend or egotistical, I don't care be the best or to come in first place. I am a good man, which nowadays people think it means, you're boring, old fashion, not being a man's, man.

If you allow me the honor to extend to you, an invitation to engage in a dialog, filled with meaningful, exciting and intriguing conversations. About what is important to you, not just some idled meaningless words, but something more concrete in purpose.

Then please feel free to write and express your willingness to connect. look forward in hearing from you and thank you for taking the time to read my post

I don't know if this is the right place for this post, what I'm looking for is a special friend that is looking for the same thing. There are times in your life when everything is going well, but for whatever the reason we feel melancholy and lonely. We don't have the same connection with your partner both mentally and physically anymore, but you still want to hear a kind words or compliments. Maybe share special moments and conversations, which may become endearing, captivating, adventurous and downright fun.

I want something deeper than just superficial intimacy. I want to connect on a level so few have had the privilege to achieve with that special friend. Finding someone to chat and share everyday things, talking about our life's journey and all the choices we've made good or bad. Having that person email, text or Kik message with during the day and evening whenever possible.
I don't know why certain people are put on the same path, coincidences, fate or sheer happenstance but nevertheless, I have always cared and valued everyone I have come into contact with. Are you the one this post was meant for, I sure hope you are, I know you're out there?

I relate well to all ages and have more than enough confidence in my ability to engage in great conversations with you. Age to me is just a number and another label society likes to place on us.
So take a chance and find out if I'm what is needed to help get you through a boring day. Remember we all need someone in our life's from time to time to make us feel alive. 

If age and marital status matter to you then, please don't bother, I may not be the one for you. I wish you all the best and thank you for taking the time to read my post.

Hello. Posting here b/c it seems like all the other areas are full of spam. smh. I'll first start out by saying I'm in a relationship. Have been for 5 years. But really getting that itch for something new. Nothing too serious. Perhaps a women in the same situation as me. A situation whee we can enjoy each other physically. It's important that you are desease free. Very important. I do get random compliments from time to time. So I am someone who women find attractive. I am Black, 180lbs, with have an athletic build. I'm putting this out there because I'm finding that race seems to be a bigger deal for women when concerning casual intimacy. Women will find a man sexually attractive and still refuse to engage intimately with him. lol

I know women are still judged more harshly for being direct about their physical needs, but I'm figuring there's someone out there in the same situation. Pic for pic. And please be an actual woman. Seems to be a lot of spam on here. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Do you miss knowing that someone is thinking of you, your heart races and your breath quickens with excitement when your phone notifies you when that special someone is thinking of you. Hearing amazing compliments, feeling wanted, sexy and still desirable. I am looking for that special woman that want to feel that way when I email or text them. 

I shall do my best to, making your synapses fire in a flurry of electrical and chemical reaction, stimulating your mind and maybe in certain areas of your body.

Exploring the world of images that forms in our mind that feel so real, so vivid it makes your body react in a way that puts a smile on your face.

I am not here to promise or pretend to be something I'm not, I'm just a real normal guy willing to invest my time into finding a friend, will you do likewise?

I don't mind if you're married, in a relationship or single, just have a beautiful personality, a positive outlook on life and not be hung up on looks or age and not mind that I'm married.

Thank you for taking the time in reading my post, best of luck in your search for a friend.

Hey there, thanks for clicking on my ad. I'm looking for a single, unattached, Asian gal-->ideally, you be Chinese and you speak Cantonese who'd be interested in being my food buddy for trying out new restaurants in the DTLA area, Alhambra/SGV area, and/or anywhere else where there might be good food to try out. Ideally, you have a steady job of your own with a steady income, can pay for your own meals, and have your own ride to meet up. If not, that's ok. Just be single, unattached, and open to the idea of trying out new restaurants. 

Bonus points if you enjoy watching anime, TVB drama, and/or reading so that at least we have some common interests to talk about while we eat. If not, that's ok. Just have something going in your life where you'd be okay with sharing. It doesn't matter what as long it's something you enjoy doing on your own private time. Socially awkward people are welcomed. Age: Please be 40 or under. 

Little bit about me: I'm not looking for a romantic relationship of any kind. Just a food buddy to hang out with. I'm single, Chinese, in my early 30's, unattached, fairly introverted but open to meeting and talking to new people. 

If this sounds like something you'd be interested, drop me an email and we'll go from there.

Are there any cute girls (or women) -- of any legal age -- who might like to kick back this afternoon, have a toke, hang out, meet someone new, and sure, MAYBE even get naked, although that is not necessary? 

I'm a guy, basically easygoing, intelligent, even fun. I can even make you laugh -- whether with me or at me, who cares. I'm sure I could make you happy. I'll bet I even could make you laugh.

I'm fairly flexible about what we do, but generally just hang and yes, maybe get naked, although that is not required, just an idea to enhance things and get your attention. Maybe talk, or we can listen to music, or watch a video (I have several very good ones on hand), go for a walk in the park -- sure, any of that MAYBE naked (except the park, of course). Tell me your ideas, I'm open to whatever. I would simply enjoy the company, regardless of what we might do, and it doesn't have to be naked. Hey, maybe we even will make a new friend. Or more.

I'm older, middle age, so you have to be OK with that -- whether you're older, younger, it all works for me. Either way, even if an age difference, I'm sure you would be comfortable with me, I'm cool enough. We should trade pics when I hear from you; again, I think you will be satisfied.

So there you go. Get in touch -- the day is only getting older.

hey guys ... i'm a married white professional guy here, 30 yo, looking to replace all my boring black and gray boxer briefs with some sexier underwear. i've done some research online and purchased a couple pair that i didn't like all that much, so hoping someone with a lot more experience with this stuff either has different kinds of underwear i can try on and/or can help me figure out some styles/brands i might like. was going to do this for my wife before our anniversary in december, bought the couple pair i didn't like much, and am back to the search. i wear XL usually, so if you have underwear that are L, XL, or XXL to try on that would be awesome. even better is if you're in the dtla area and could swing by my office sometime so i can try them on or something. let me know.

Ok. . ..I know it's more than crazy. . . but I would love to take Selena Gómez on a romantic dinner date ; )

First and foremost.... I'm not a crazed Selena fan.... or any sort of stalker... heaven knows she already has far too many of those. No, I'm just a regular guy who isn't afraid to shoot WAY out of my league... even though I should be. 

Every time I have seen her, I am amazed at how mature and graceful she is. It's as if she is an old soul in a young body. At the same time I get a sense she is quite sad.... and maybe wish I could be the one to change all that for her.

At a minimum I know we could have a super date..... and how crazy would that be, sitting across from her, at some candle lit room.

Anyhow...I'm a big goofball, and can't believe some of the things I attempt.... but nothing ventured nothing gained or so it goes.

One of my pictures is a link to my silly video I made for Selena...and hoping that someone with way more friends than myself, can maybe link it to their Facebook or Instagram, and help this poor barber get the date of all time ; )

Thanks so much girls. . . and best of luck to you all, in your search for LOVE!

I am fit and work out regularly. I would like to take my workout to the next level. Not having a gym buddy to help spot or encourage to go a little further has slow down my progress. I love reading about fitness and am pretty knowledgable. Looking for someone who is equally versed if not more that I can learn from or learn together. I would hire a trainer but don't have enough for one so this is the next best thing. Open to someone who wants to mentor too at the gym. 

I am funny (I do comedy) and work at a popular Hollywood bar. Fit and goodlooking and an awesome friend to have. We can hang in the gym or outside it too if we get along. I eat pretty healthy and love to go out for drinks once in a while. Always have an appetite for some good steak or a nice bowl of 420.

Quick facts about me: I live near downtown LA, I'm caring, considerate, thin,
single, I don't have any kids, have helped thousands of people in my life (maybe

I'm a woman with a desire to meet another woman who shares similar interests. 
Someone kind, local preferred with goals and a positive or at least an apathetic view on their not so healthy habits. I smoke cigarettes, 420 and often incorporate speed into my diet also. Regardless- I lack essentially all the negative qualities of someone who indulges in the latter. I'd like to find a friend who shares these traits. Just as these are important only in the regard of similarity, lack of judgment, kinship in the value of staying invisible to those who'd seek to reprimand a controlled lifestyle with barbaric, unnecessary and critical punishment- Please be someone with high standards for herself and her friends. At least a car, place to live and a sense of purpose brought about via your job, your hobby, your goals. I work best when someone has faith in my abilities and genuinely wants me around. If that's the case? I can learn anything, accomplish anything. I am highly proffecient in many areas of professionalism. From branding for major corperations, to driving and artistry. (Painting, drawing, writing, design, consulting, event planning, psychology, astrology etc) 

Be open to straight forward communication, be honest, be someone who is strong minded and well versed in how to be there for a friend.

Hi! I am 39 years old, no kids, have a boyfriend. I am down to earth, in shape, easy to talk to and nice. Looking for new girl friends. Miss having girl talk! Things you just can't talk about with your man. Most of my friends have moved away or are too busy with their families. If you would like someone to chat with, get together occasionally, and have a new, loyal friend.... please do hit reply! Put your favorite activity in the subject line. Pic is appreciated. Will voice verify. NO MEN.

Oh, and I am bi curious too if that is something you are at all interested in. If not, completely cool! I will not try to hit on you or anything, lol.

I enjoy boxing. I like working out, watching it and attending fights. It'd be cool to know someone of the fairer sex who does the same. Ideally for someone who actually likes the sweet science and doesn't mind conversing on it, practicing it for workouts and watching it at times.

im looking for a friend who's basically in the same boat as i am..just a normal gal (24-30) with similar interests who's also looking for a friend. it would help if you were local to the 818, 562, or in DTLA. i would prefer if you had a bf as well so we can double date, but single girls are of course welcomed either way!

Pretty much just bored & decided to give cl another try to make new cyber friends lol 
I have time on my hands to chat away for the most part so if you're seeking just someone to keep your mind occupied while killing time at work or what not I may be your pal! 

I am located in the valley so if by any chance you're open to making a new friend then that would be cool. I'm 420 friendly so if you are too that's a plus! I'm not here to be a pic collector so im not interested in swapping pics. One is fine so if you want one of mine attach yours first (:

Hi there! :)

I'm a fit and active Christian woman looking for other Christian Women and Men for platonic friendships only. Married or Single, that's fine. Just be ready and available to actually meet in person! (If you're a man, and you're married, DO NOT CONTACT ME.) 

I don't have children, so my time is my own. What I find very challenging in this city is meeting other people who share the same values as me. I'm a follower of Christ Jesus. I'm a born-again Christian. I don't smoke/drink alcohol or use any type of drugs whatsoever. I never have and don't find it interesting at all. 

I enjoy all outdoor activities. Shopping and dining out at CLEAN hole-in-the-walls, ethnic restaurants, Asian noodle houses & vegan and vegetarian restaurants is another favorite pastime of mine. I'm open to making new friends, so if there are activities that you enjoy, I'm willing to try them, as long as it doesn't jeopardize my well-being! :D

I'm a university-educated professional who is well-read and well-spoken. I have a happy and mellow personality. I'm easy-going, as long as people are respectful and cooperative, too. :) I'm a very good listener, have a positive attitude, and I'm a loyal friend.

My pet peeves: People who are inconsiderate, don't or can't communicate, and/or are constantly late.

If you're similar to me and you're a mature person over 35 (and under 60), please feel free to get in touch. Please send me an introduction that I would appreciate, meaning, if you send me a one liner, I will not respond. There is too much spam everywhere.

*****I prefer that you're a woman, unless you're a man who can be my younger brother. I'm looking for emotionally mature people who are followers of Jesus that I can fellowship with and do fun platonic activities with.

If you're a vegan or vegetarian, that's even better! :)

Thanks for reading and God bless you. Please be ready to speak on the phone within a day or two of responding. (Hopefully, our schedules will align.) I'm interested in talking on the phone and seeing if we hit it off!! :) Then, we can make plans to meet within a week or two. Thanks! :)


Cities: Culver City, Los Angeles, West LA , West Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Miracle Mile, Century City, Beverly Hills, Marina Del Rey. Orange County is okay, too.

Hi,
I'm looking for local friends to hang out and be actual friends with. Best friends would be even better!! Do things together, or just hang. I hope we can get to know one another first before meeting. It's awkward to meet strangers. Please be serious. Please don't reply out of urge if you don't plan on a meeting and being a friend. It's a waste of everyone's time. No couples please. If you're married it's fine with me. Who am I to judge? Though I don't plan on being someone's secret. So only reply if you can have friends, and can do friend things with me. I don't want my feelings hurt because of any drama in the relationship. I'm a very kind, genuine, and caring individual. I genuinely care for others and their feelings. I want to be there for you, as much as I hope that you'll be there for me. We need to emotionally support each other. We all need a support system in place for us for whenever we need it. Also, it's biologically our survival needs to surround ourselves with others that care about us. It's what makes us mentally healthy. Among other things. I want to keep a continuous communication going. Not, just for a week and it ends. How's that a friendship? 😁😞 I thank you for your time in reading my AD my dear friend. You're appreciated!! Take care. 😋❤️

Just looking for some one who is currently studying the CA CDL Handbook and/or is learning to drive.
Whether its just to learn to just have it or is looking to go into the Trucking field and just wants or needs a study partner. I'm going to be going into local runs just here in state working with a friends company, who also do some out of state runs and if it's something you like to look into while we study i can always introduce you to them. Basic this is just a platonic thing just to make it more easier to study and quiz each other and have some support going into the trucking life.

A little about my self im 27 with family and friends in the trucking scene. I go on local trips with my cousin who shows me the in's and out's of what i need to know when driving, parking, and doing inspections. He does own 2 trucks one which he want me to drive once i'm licensed and it would be nice to at least have a partner to just get experience with to start once licensed. Never know might end up working with them doing local runs and Port runs from Long Beach to the yard in Carson. 

So if your interested just drop me an email and well see how we set up our study sessions whether it be over Skype, Phone, or in person at the truck yard in Carson or coffee shop or park or wherever really. So just put ""CDL Study Partner"" in the subject line with a little about your self and how far in you are into the handbook or when you will be getting it.

If anyone wants to come over and hang out, maybe have a beer and watch a movie or something, message me. I don't care what you look like, or how old you are. Though I'd prefer a smoking hot girl in her twenties, all I'm really looking for is a friend. Send a pic if you want to see mine ...and no I won't sign up for your site, and, if you ask for my number and text me from an email address, I won't respond. I just want to meet and hang out with a cool person, and possibly cuddle a bit.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for but it be nice to spend some time with someone again. I've been single for a few years now and I'll admit I do miss talking hours away about anything, or simply enjoying a good film or tv show with someone and talking about it or even being introduced to someone that I can leave a good impression on or vice versa. I'm 29, Hispanic, sort of at a low point in my life emotionally as well as physically but it would be nice to meet someone in any capacity. Even if I never hear from you again, it be nice to meet someone new. If you could come over to my place, just hang out, maybe I can make a new friend, maybe not. I have satellite, Netflix, Hulu. I'm free most nights as it's been quite a long time since I've gone out, so if anybody is willing to hang out with me, be prepared to enjoy chatting. I'm as humble as I am modest. I love coffee, dogs, baseball, and well written films and tv. Not a smoker, occasional drinker. Hope to hear back :-)

I am looking for new friends. People who understand you do not have to spend cash to have a good time. Artistic creative people. 

If you are the type of person who wants to play a game of checkers and say we can't because we don't have a board. Get out of here. That attitude is pee-pee. You should respond. Lets grab some rocks and etch a checkerboard into the ground and play. That is how it is done. lol

I am not necessarily looking to date. I want friends and if things go from there that is chill as well.

So if you are down to meet up, chill, and draw some chalk. Hit me up.
If you want to know who I am ask. I'll send you a link to everything you would need to know.


In Addition: 
- Sending a picture gets you brownie points and I will send one back. 
- It helps if you live close by. It is not an issue tho esp if you travel. lol
- Helps a lot if you are single and without children.
- I will not download any special communication apps or programs.
- We should meet in person asap!!

Let me try this again. When I ran a similar ad recently I got answers from women in their 40s and 50s who thought I was looking for a mistress. I am not.

I am an old man, in good shape, hwp. I have been widowed for many years after a long marriage. I am not seeking love much less a wife or live-in companion (or mistress). What I am seeking is a sensual, friendly relationship with an age-appropriate woman. I crave physical contact - hugs, strokes, cuddling. This is not the same as looking to get laid. Whether it goes in that direction would only be by mutual choice and after some time.

The essence of the relationship I seek is a mutual desire for warm, comforting physical contact. Whether we find other interests in common, like music, movies, art, books, hiking, would remain to be seen. We might be very compatible physically and have nothing else in common. Or maybe we would. In any event, I am not offering or at this point in my life emotionally capable of being in a marriage-like arrangement so if that is your long-term goal I am not your man.

You should be at least 60 years old. Please do not answer this ad if you are younger! There is no upper age limit as long as you are in touch with your physical desire for human contact. I have no restrictions as to your race or ethnicity. (I am white.) Within limits, I have no preferences as to your physical type. (I would draw the line at what is called SSBBW in CraigsList-ese.) The women who have been important in my life have ranged from skinny to Rubenesque; their shape has not been one of the most important things about any of them.

I live alone in downtown LA. I can host or travel. We could arrange a first meeting someplace public for coffee or a drink. I would like this to happen soon. Since I am retired I am free much of the time.

If you reply please put CONTACT as the subject to weed out CL spam and scams. If you reply I will respond with my name, photos, and phone / text #.

Repostin! 

.... but with attention and new changes ~details on the 'Room~mate' part haha:) , as I find myself in a situation where I need a new place to live! For 2 years I was at a a mission house in Los Angeles, basically almost for free in exchange for a lill bit of volunteer work here and there. I went home for almost a year in NY to visit family and got word that this particular one is being closed. 

I hope to find a similar place again (they basically sponsored me so I could work full time on an unpaid Christian ministry for those in the entertainment industry ). . .but for now maybe someone truly has need of a Bestie, and would think it cool to try livin together 4 a few months? 
Maybe between like $200- 400 to let me couch crash until I can find something that will sponsor the work that I've been doin, again:) 
Or if we can find rooms in a New place together? (I'll be looking as well to find something about in that $200-400 range for both a friend and myself... to have our own separate rooms!! I already have a few leads:) 

I do need to figure this out asap, as I've made commitments that I would move back pretty soon,.. so my response preference might be to a bff interested in rooming for a while, yet it's not dependent on such. Again, . .it would be fine if it were only for a few month, non serious with livin commitment, trial type thing! 



~~~~
okk reposting on the best friend part!
(What I'm really after most!) (grin!) 
~~~~

'Ey there! ~smile~ 

I feel like it may a bit peculiar making such a longg post, but also imagine that life isn't gunna move forward in 2015 unless I really put out 'there' what my hopes are! 


I'm really looking for a (similar aged 28-35 maybe?) lifelong best girl friend, who is really after that ""1"" best gal pal, in life. That one sidekick who's been at it with you through it All- from youth's endlesss adventures, to where yrs down the line ya end up rockin a senior home together (that's not meant to sound too cheesy, haha) --still w that inpartable bond and that ultimately ""special "" relationship... as each other's life's best friends. :) That type of thingg? :) 

I thought I had that years ago, but she ended up moving + eventually stopped carin about what we had. It's been quite a while since I've had anything with true 'depth' w another girl .. 

I'm Hopin to find someone who **like myself (It's hard admitting this, but I don't have Anyone near this really. I don't even have a Sister! LoL), who's lived in that lack & Void; **who doesn't 'all ready' have their one go-to girl, or a network of their lifelong collected bffs? 
(This almost seems rare to come across I'm findin haha)
Just someone who's a similar 'lone wolf' maybe but wants that set apart specialness and depth with another girl... and like me just hasn't been able to quite find it yet


~~~~
Also throwin this out there as an ideal situation maybee?~ I'm in the entertainment industry (pro-model on and off for years... but getting more away from that in lieu of christian volunteer work) so it would be awesome to seek out the occasional work/ or gig with a bestie as well! I may want to get into doing some promotional gigs or background tv/video work ('clean' stuff in case anyone is wondering, as this is craigslist lol) 

I also live in a really really cheap/ (near free + pretty private) place on a church's grounds if that person would be interested in bein roomates. (Not to rush such a thing though!) 

So anyway more about me and or a potential fit for a best friend, ...(one certainly doesn't have to work in entertainment, in fact I feel like I connect w those who don't just as well, see below paragraphs.. haha)~ I'm 32, but still look early to mid 20s and hope to always have a extremely free and youthful spirit!. So between 27ish-35 may be a good age range? I'm single, straight, no kids, n may not ever have them. (just don't seem to relate to that way of life as some can haha...I might adopt a pre-teen someday tho! LoL) Since I'm single I'd really like to get back into a few girls nights out either at the local or Hollywood bars/ clubs ...but I'm not in the 21 yr old go out every other night state anymore, so just not all the time :p. I'm honestly reeallly Down to Earth and well normal, Grew up in the north east a bit hippie/ punk in high school, so I'm pretty well rounded and have all these sides to me that don't necessarily go together (grin), haha. I feel like sometimes I'm a bit rare & unique in that sense! 

I like arsty people and things, music festivals, anything sooaking in nature, random one of a kind hobbies (want to get into glass ~ blowing this yr), crazie adventures, trying to make a difference in the world, etc. 
I'm more Introverted in the sense that I need a Loot of alone time (** n this would be Reeeally key if livin under the same roof haha:), 

I'm about Depth/ and quality over quantity in relationships, (I'd rather have one or two crazy deep people in my life [say the guy soulmate and female best friend], than be keeping up w a lot of superficial relationships ) etc... *But I'm a really friendly (and socially w it, lol) introvert who enjoys getting out there, meeting people and seein the beauty life inevitably has to offer!! I've always been one to hang out with any ""type"" of group!! 

I also tend to get along better with people who are more contemplative~ of the same personality as well (and can also appreciate those who've suffered or ave been through a lot in their lives) 


Ok so in review!! (lol.) If ya think we may be a good match, hopefully write a good amount about yourself, and let me know that ya relate to my post? I tried this before in my native state & had no idea who to reply to as so many people wrote a line or two. Maybe just let me know u're on the same wave-length about being the type to have one top bff, rather than you being a 5-10 bff type person & that you may have need of one... Oohe guess I should say this upfront! haha... I currently am w out a car, but I doo hope to get one... . But maybe someone who sees the value in my post enough for that not to deter them... And if you have a car, I might be able to get us near Free Livin! I'm currently in the Valley but better near free living may be in Monrovia (or Hollywood, fingers grossed ~ I'm lookin to be down there more often N working on finding a room maybe 1 week per month) . Also anything like a fb so I can see you're real?, haha (grin) I really hope you're out there? ~ and we can make a supa fun life together in La~!!

Please possibly-Allow Us: to FIND work as an apt. management team to live rent FREE!

Aloha Human Honey,

I seek to team up with you and LOCATE apartment management work together! We can be partners as living-work-room-dream-mates to enjoy the benefit of FREE RENT if we collect it and account for it. Please consider my proposal to be my apprentice and associate to establish an apartment management and/or supervision team. 
You are welcome 2 co-exist; with me here in Temecula, CA: until we locate work. 
This is a career opportunity requiring honest happy intelligence; providing flexibility to develop other sources of income and achieve personal goals. Many positions require a TEAM to administrate and supervise maintenance. I promise: I can work and live together joyously; because the joy of a good job and luxurious living space predicate dreams of Love. I am trilingual Love/Spanish/English with 10 years experience managing apartments in the Southern California area. Your abilities and beauty add to our resume especially if you know another language.
Ladies are more compatible to me; psychologically, philosophically, physically, psychically, and politically: therefore; I seek a Lady work partner, to share living space because working together daily; is easy with pleasant personalities and an honest desire for lucrative longevity. Being a team mate facilitates acquiring work: as a Human Resource person advised me; ""I would hire you: BUT; our insurance doesn't want a lonely guy with the keys to beautiful peoples' apartments"". I promise to cooperate and handle our lack or enjoyment of a sexual reality with dignity; according to our eternal compatibilities and your desires. 
There are three ways we can prosper; 1. We locate work as business apprentice-associate-partners and employees to receive a salary and an apartment to reside in, 2. Contract work as Absolute Supervision my company to earn a percentage of; the gross collected rents we collect, 3. We buy with a zero $ down payment deal; we submit generous purchase proposals benefitting seller to acquire and operate apartment buildings. 
Every month our rent will be free plus a salary which depends on amount of units we manage and our responsibilities: or we develop a cash flow from buildings we acquire. It is easy to enjoy being rewarded for: executive honesty to collect rents and manage fairly/equally so tenants can quietly enjoy their apartment homes. Some positions have expensive building rents; therefore, housing is not included. Thus, we earn a generous salary, live off-site at an income property we purchase and own together.
All conditions are negotiable; and we shall respect the promises we establish.
1. We can exist harmoniously and enjoy life where we dream, eat, work and exercise. 
2. I shall respect your privacy and will abide by all living conditions we agree to.
3. I exist as a EVO-lacto-vegetarian; yet, I appreciate all appetites.
4. I am 420 compatible; I party with moderation to celebrate life socially
I am a dignified professional: upgrading my career, I shall excel with an effervescent partner. Our mutual cooperation will earn us a new apartment home with responsibilities to orchestrate a functional housing complex that enhances the community. I have the willingness to work anywhere in Southern California. I am well researched 'cultural vulture'; I co-exist with all cultures of people joyfully and I enjoy the best from all ethnicities to promote and establish world peace with prosperity. I an avid advocate and member of the US GREEN tea PARTY because: we must help our global village avoid extinction! Our World SOUL-U-tion; is #LOVEvolution: first end hunger, then dissipate hate, vanquish violence, dismantle nuclear reactor/weapons, and cure cancers! Thank you: your time and consideration are appreciated.
My offer for a live in apprenticeship: is contingent on our compatibility; I appreciatively consider all offers for barter, work, lodging, counseling, and especially Love.
JESUS, GOD and scientific Logic command: LOVE your neighbor; and bake Love-cake. 
Mahalo Peace and Love all ways: Robert aka mr-funsun.	
p.s. In my LIFE: seduction begins in a Lady's heart: thus; if you are not attracted to me, I can forget romance and excel at profitability while we help preserve oxygen and water to establish human dignity for all. I promise to adhere to our agreement and exist in harmony: because; I respect and adore ladies, my final sexual fantasy is to create babies. I produce peoples' dreams; not seduce people, I exist to help people achieve contentment.

Greetings!?
Spring has arrived, and summer is on the way - who else likes to go out in the sun and play?? I enjoy hiking, music-esp live outdoor concerts, discovering parks-esp picnics (with Scrabble & card games?!), movies, esp drive-in movies (they do still exist!). 
Yes, I am single, an unattached - you should be too (in case we happen to hit it off). No pressure for dating otherwise, just looking for fun company for this great weather : ) . I am from the east Coast, I love to travel, esp discovering semi-local gems. 
I work hard, and enjoy playing hard. You should be emotionally stable, down to earth, fun, at least somewhat adventurous, etc. A woman that is attractive, fit (at least working on it, or willing) and creative are a bonus, as I am that also. I am of color, though you do not have to be, I am open to race and age- just be mature, yet young in spirit. Pic for pic.

Hey,
So I Dont know what this is actually going to accomplish but I need friends. All my friends now are really busy with work or out of state. My family is too. 

I had a somewhat girlfriend but I Dont think so anymore.. She kinda just stopped talking to me and wouldn't say why. Anyways I'm open for new friends and just hanging out. I'm kinda just posting this wherever. 

I'm 22, 5ft8, athletic slim build. I try to go to the gym at least 3 days a week. 

I'm open to anything whether its friendship, benefits, Or actually leading somewhere. I don't have a busy schedule cause I do these gigs for one week a month enough to pay for a few months. I'm not involved in school. I'm really not a creep or weirdo. People who come into contact with me really likes me for the most part. I think I'm just a little heart broken ish and need time to repair. But I want to meet more people whether its just fun or friendship. 
I really like girls that are cute/pretty over hot/sexy. Shyness is okay as long as you are willing to open up a little. 
And for a while I've really been into latina girls. But I'm open for all types. Thank you!

I'm a great listener and have good advice (at least thought provoking) to offer if asked. Educated professional but real peoples. I'm laid back, simple and my life soul is lite. I see the humor in life and will definitely entertain you. 
Not looking to get romantically involved or any of those other acronyms I see on here. Just some good people sharing good times. I don't want to say I'm specific on a certain race or age or lifestyle. If we mesh, we're friends. That easy. I'm married and I love my wife but I'm a communicator and she can only handle so much (lol) but seriously, I just want to converse and share human essences.

Do you like watching Batman movies, live action and/or animated? Do you enjoy reading comics and/or graphic novels? Are you a film buff? Obsessed with music? If so you should message me, I'm looking for more friends, someone to talk to about comics, movies and well just random stuff. Aesthetically I'd say I'm decent looking, I'm not a bad person but I can be selfish at times, I'm working on that though. I'm not good at making friends at all so I'm mostly hanging out alone. Also I'm a bit of a stoner so if you smoke we can smoke and listen to music.

For the non-MTHFR going ""huh?"", no, it's not the insult abbreviated, it's a very serious and disabling health condition; this page will answer all your questions:
http://www.stopthethyroidmadness.com/mthfr/

---------

If you are dealing with this, or are a doctor who understands what we go through, I would be interested in hearing from you. I felt this week like I was literally going insane, as I started B's therapy. Felt better at first, then it made me worse, hypersensitive to everything and flying off the handle so I quit the B's and now feel better. I thought I was going to have a heart attack as I was getting stabbing heart pain. 

I don't know how to deal with this. It has destroyed my relationships. Now middle-aged. I can no longer cope with apartment living, surrounded by loud, inconsiderate neighbors smoking is polluting my place and destroying my health further. I can't cope with noise. I need to relocate ASAP, but I can't afford my own place, and I don't know how to handle a roommate when I can't cope with background noise and I am allergic to all odoriferous environmental pollutants.

If you understand please feel free to write I would like to talk to someone who understands, or is coping with the illnesses & many symptoms, but not interested in meeting as I am completely disabled and can't really go out. Of course, platonic only. that will not change. Thank you for reading, enjoy your health if you have it, and have a great day.

I felt that I couldn't meet anyone real, that nobody would be able to fill the void in my mind,

So before you start judging me, hear me out first. Ive just been busy working and working, paying down some debt, and never really focused on trying to get laid. And im not the type of jerk that will lead a girl on, thinking shes in a serious relationship just to have sex, then end it afterwards, when someone else comes along and you've grown tired of a person.

I know a lot of guys do that, but not me, yet at the moment im thinking maybe i should have been a jerk and do that, since they seem to enjoy themselves more, and enjoy there life. But i just cant feel right doing that. Im also not the type of person to just have random sex with a stranger in a bar, seriously, with so many stds out there, why would you think of doing that.

So what im looking for then, is someone i can talk to, get to know, and maybe occasionally see a movie, just to see if we get along. And if we do vibe well, id like to set it up where we can be open with each other, talking venting and maybe meet once a week depending on our schedules to release some stress together

So if you are like me, its been a while, or maybe your a virgin, i dont know, but just need a safe, disease free friend to release some tension and stress with, please email me. Thanks

Let's cut to the chase and describe the qualities that were both searching for: first of all, I'm looking to make a friendship with someone who aggrandizes the outdoors activities than clubbing. I enjoy hiking, camping, and if possible sailing. I'm also into painting and photography. I'm looking for someone who is open to weekend road excursions. I don't care about your looks as long as your charming, comical, and spontaneous then we could be good friends. 

If interest, please take the time and introduce yourself. Maybe some ideas for a first friendly date.

Hi there. I'm looking to find a female friend who has a sense of feminine style. Makeup, cute outfits, shoes, accessories, etc.

As I look around my office 90% of the woman here have guy hair cuts or did not spend any time at all making themselves presentable. Flat shoes and pants that look like they came off the men's table at Costco all around me.

It would be really refreshing to have a female friend that actually looks like ""female"".
Don't be intimidated and think I want a magazine model friend. If you're into designer fashion bonus points to you but all I'm really looking for is someone who puts a little effort in to excentuating their feminine side.

Anyways, this is probably a tall order to find on Craigslist but if you're the exception send me a message.

Jim Henson wrote the quote above. I sort of adore the guys legacy, his work on the whole.

So! I don't post here often but after some consideration I figured why not? I recently got out of a pretty serious relationship and I feel a little bit lost sometimes. We are still friendly but I based a lot of my plans around the idea of ""us"". My career is going great but I definitely need to jump start my social life.

I have many friends all through Los Angeles and the Valley but I want to make some friends more in my immediate vicinity. I live in Koreatown, more specifically around Wilshire & Normandie. I'm looking for partners in crime and fellow urban adventurers who I could hang out with on the regular. I miss that aspect of the East Coast. Friendship immediacy.

I'm really into music, television, hiking, video games, comic books, and art. I want to travel more and see the Pacific Northwest. Stuff like that. Long conversations. Late nights. Creating art together.

So yeah... if this seems interesting then hit me up. My therapist said try looking online so this is my good faith effort. I tend to get along best with females but guys are welcome too. No bigots, flakes, or far right conservatives. I got opinions on things that tend to irk those types. A great local best friend is all I'm asking. Too much?

I only mention this because if you are someone who prefers a homogeneous look among your friends i would like to spare ourselves the awkwardness of your uncomfortably. 
aaaaanywaaaay 
I look forward to hearing from you and cant wait to find treasure!! 
I highly doubt that this will get a response seeing as no sex has been offered! LOL 
but its worth a try right?


PLEASE NOTE:
After a few emails sent back and forth I will require at least one voice phone call
as should you! you never know who could be posting this ad and I dont know who is responding, 
so I must confirm that you are indeed a woman and you visversa. 

NO PREDATORY MEN!!

This is important to know, I suck at salsa dancing! Hence me looking for a potential partner around the Santa Monica area for lessons. We might even become real genuine friends. I'm 30, and tall if you care about not having a short dance partner. Hardly a woman too tall for me, unless you were like 6'3 haha. Let me know if you're interested, and I'll send more info about myself.

Hello my fellow LGBT,

Me and my partner are looking for a place to live in LA immediately! Our professions are both in entertainment and so we need to return as soon as possible and figured there is no one better to ask than the community! The ideal situation would be a sublet/temporary that would give us time to figure out the area and set up work properly. But ultimately, we are looking for an apartment or studio that we can lease for a year! If you know anyone, or you can provide this for us please contact us! We are VERY neat, quiet, and always on the go! Help us out if you can! Thank you so much! We also want to meet new friends in the process, so it's a win/win!

So just reply with a short description of yourself, hobbies and whatnot. Put your favorite movie as the subject line and I will reply with my number if I think you are a real person. :)

I have to say that trying to find a valuable friend is as difficult as finding a needle in a haystack as they say. I've posted a few times, chatted with great people and some not so great but I have yet to say I've had luck and found someone I can truly keep in touch with and remain friends. Many times I come across replies that start out sounding as a genuine response to my posting but sadly end up looking for something a bit more ""quick and intimate"" and well... I'm not looking for that kind of intimacy and definitely not that kind of girl. I'm 5'6, light brown skin, dark brown eyes, long brown hair, and Mexican-American raised in a small town South of Los Angeles. I could say that optimism is one of my strengths and remain hopeful of meeting someone to share a friendship with. Hope all is well.

Looking to text / email / kik ....etc.... with someone of any age, or relationship status.

What I am NOT looking for is;
-to change anyone's status or situation, 
-no really even looking to meet up (unless it is mutually agreed upon after getting to know each other quite well.) 
-for a FWB or NSA situation
-hookup or one night stand
-to solve the world problems,

What I AM looking for;
-someone who will carry on a conversation;
-someone who is interested in talking about almost anything, even if it means making a goof out of yourself or me,
-someone who is understanding that I don't wait by the email for the next one, but I appreciate seeing one from you
-someone who will make me smile when their email comes in because they invested some time in sharing about themselves while getting to know me
-age is no issue (as I mentioned) I can talk and relate to most people
-I will want to see who I am talking to eventually, so expect to share a pic or 2 (I do reciprocate)
-Looking for that someone who is looking for a friend that can be there to help them through things but will also be there to share in my experiences as well.
-Location doesn't matter to me

OK I guess I kind of rambled on a bit.
If you are interested in seeing if we click feel free to email me, I will reply to everyone who does email me because you never know where your next friend might be!

Have a great day, and change something in the subject so I know you are real!!!!!

Hello all you beautiful ladies. I'm Anthony single 45 Latino. I'm on here looking for honesty and someone real. I'm tired of not having that friend to go out and do fun things with. But at the same time I'm tired of all the lies and bs. I'm willing to take things slow. And maybe find that special lady that can be my queen. I know good things take time. And I really don't want to get hurt again. So I'm on here looking for honest friendship. I am open to age and race. I enjoy going to the movies. Nice dinners. Long walks. I also love to swim. And skinny dip whenever possible. I also give a great massage. And I enjoy using my big hands. I recently got into yoga. But wish I could find someone to join me and help me out a little. I also tried the nudist scene. And it was a great feeling of freedom. I just need a little more practice to get rid of my shyness. I am very open minded. And not afraid to go out on the town with you dressed beautiful or however you feel comfortable. I'm 6'3"" tall and in good shape. So if you want a true friend like I do. I'm here for you. Any questions please ask. And thank you for your time.

Ok heres the deal, i want to make friends of similar interests but im a bit of a shut in and so its a little hard for me to meet people because of that. Ive always been the quiet anti social type growing up. Playing video games imstead of going out. But since i moved back to LA ive tried going out on my own but always end up getting bored and going home to watch tv and have no ine to really talk to. Im just doing this to hopefully make some cool openminded friends who have stuff in conmon and get excited about the same things i do. 
About myself:
Im 28
I like to play video games mostly on the pc, mostly play League of Legends, WoW (on and off) and always get the pokemon games on release. I like anime (some of my favorites are naruto, tokyo ghoul, highschool of the dead, FML brotherhood) just to name a few.
Always been fascinated with asian culture. 
I dont smoke or drink or do drugs of any kind (i see it as pointless) but i have nothing against people that do, i just dont do it myself. 
Anyways thats all i can think of right now but if you would like to het to know eachother some more please find me on kik and hopefully we can be friends
I think im very easy to talk to and very open minded.

You and my bf began to eat her, I get up and sit you on the table next to her. I began to rub both of your pussies at the same time. He continues to thrust his dick in me from behind.

This may sound like a very strange request, but I'm looking for a fit / attractive person who wants to cuddle, or hang out together in close proximity. 

Watch a movie, have a couple drinks, conversation and just relax. No expectations, no pressure. Nothing sexual at all - really. I just miss human contact without it being in any way about sex. 

I'm settling back into LA after a couple years overseas. I work long hours with a very demanding job, and I don't have much of a social circle - and don't feel comfortable turning to a friend for this. 

I'm open to men or women - totally different dynamic with either. I'm the boss at work but want to just relaxing/melting with someone behind closed doors where I don't have to be in charge, which is why I'm open to male contact - if that makes sense. Straight preferred to avoid sexual expectation.

I'm very fit and an athlete, good looking, educated and normal - a catch, if you will. Not bat shit crazy, down to earth white guy who isn't looking for anything jacked up. 

Open to age as long as you're fit, clean, reasonably attractive and aren't boring. I'm very optimistic and love to laugh, so a sense of humor goes a long way.

Drinks, food and/or movie is on me. Just be normal, cool and not a pro looking to be paid, please. Thanks.

I am looking for the man in the attached photo. The picture was taken approximately 18 years ago (at least), based on the note in the back that says the picture was received in 1998.

He is someone I've never met but would be interested in meeting to find out about my past.

If you can tell me his name or any details about him, so I know you're not trolling, please send me a message!

Hello!

Like everyone else out there I'm just looking for some solid friendships. I'm not picky but it would obviously be better if we shared some common interests...I'm 25, in a relationship, mobile, and employed. I'm really friendly and get along with everyone!
Likes: the beach, hiking, stopping to pet every dog on the street, going out for drinks, trying new things, staying in and doing nothing, movies, dancing, comic books, collecting more action figures than I know what to do with, and traveling.
Dislikes: hardcore drugs, cigarettes, overly dramatic/negative people, self seriousness, people that can't take a joke. 

The search for true friends in this city has left me feeling pretty bitter. If you're feeling the same or think we would click, please send me a message!

I just got home from work about and been horny as hell at the register! I think a customer noticed my fat boner through my dress pants lmao

I am latino, 6'1, very clean, shower every day and stay organized, respectful of course, educated, free of any sort of std's and all that stuff, 

i love to eat pussy and been told i do a great job at it tho i gotta admit we gotta click for me to really bring it home not to mention it has to be clean and maintained! Lol for real tho
My favorite position would be doggy style or a girl ontop! Good Lord that's the best feeling! No one has made me cum thru that position tho (; just saying

All i am asking is that you are local and that you are ready to have some fun! NO drama or any of that stuff please!
Be clean of course ( no std's, nor HIV!)
take care of yourself (:
and that's pretty much it! Also its a huge plus if you are on the pill or can host!

Age, weight, race, ethnicity, etc is not an issue at all! I've only been with Latina's tho so trying something new and different would also be fun

hmu with some info and pics!! (:

messages just asking for pix will be deleted. i'm not desperate lol

I'll delete your email right away if you hit on me, I've been getting way too many emails like that and it's not what I'm here for.

The Situation:
I'm an LA native moving back after graduating university a year early. All of my friends are still in school or otherwise unavailable so I have no one free to live with me starting this Summer. I'll have a full time job and will be able to afford a nice but modest 2-bedroom and would love to live with a cool young person (gender not important) in a similar situation. I'm hoping to start looking at places sometime this Summer and want to get to know prospective roommates before then so we can bond and know who we'll be living with before jumping in!

Please include a picture in your message! 

Little bit about me:
Non-Smoker but 420 friendly. 
Queer
Cis Woman
Latina
Speak 4 languages
Have a house-trained dog, she's less than 10 lbs and super friendly, never bitten anyone in her life. 
I'm allergic to SOME cats, if you have one it's not a deal-breaker we'll just have to figure it out. 

Housekeeping:
I'm easy going and flexible but after living with absolute slobs for the past 3 years I like to keep a clean house. However I'm not your maid so pitch in and we'll be good! Messy is cool just clean your fucking dishes within a couple days not weeks pls <3 (my current roommate doesn't seem to get that dishes don't magically disappear after the first week of them being in the sink)

Self:
I love movies, I guarantee I've seen every chick flick you can think of but I'm also obsessed with Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. I like girl punk and indie folky shit, my music taste is all over from Sonic Youth to Kate Nash to Queen to (don't judge me) Bowling for Soup. I like drinking pink wine on my living room floor and having game nights as well as going out and listening to music or eating at diners around 1 am. I'm an anthropology major, passionate about social justice and feminism hoping to work for a labor union and eventually go to law school. We can talk about social theory and Foucault or 90s tv shows and our favorite Harry Potter DADA teachers. I've had a string of shitty roommates and I'd just really love to live with someone I could be good friends with as well. Let me know if you're the sort of magical unicorn that will mesh with my flavor of weird.

Ive posted once on here before but well I didnt meet anyone who I was able to have a nice continous conversation with. Most of the girls on here are just looking to hook up, not what Im look for so If thats your intention please dont reply to my ad. You will just be waisting your time....
Sooo anyways Im 18 and hispanic , Yes I know Im still pretty young but believe me I am very mature and I know what I want. Age shouldnt even matter but well everyone has there preferences right? Well Im just on here to meet new girl-lesbian friends. I dont have much of those ha. Im not looking for a relationship at the moment more like lets be friends and see where that takes us. I want someone who I can take out to the movies, hiking, or to stargaze at the beach. I LOVE the beach !! Age, size, race or any of those factors do not matter to me at all. 
During the freetime I have , who am I kidding I am free 24/7 :P , I go out and play soccer. But most of the time I just stay in and watch Netflix. Im not really the type of person who likes to party a lot occasionally I will but not often. I dont drink but ocasionally will same with smoking although I havent smoked in 3 months Ive been sober.
I think this is getting a little too long ha so Ill stop here I love to talk so If you love to talk as well dont hesitate to message me Ima pretty chill, laid back person.:) dont ask me for a picrure right away lets chat and get to know each other then we can exchange pics.

Hi Everyone!

Interested in going to see Ellie Goulding on Friday April 8th. 

Have not yet bought tickets. I am still looking for them. Not interested in getting the most expensive tickets. We would have to agree on a budget. The most I will spend is 75 dollars. 

For safety, meet at the Staples Center. 

Email me a little about yourself. I would prefer someone near my age so we can have something in common, but no worries. Picture for picture.

I am a happily married man just traveling alone for work for the first time. I am honestly not looking for sex. Travelling alone sucks though... and it has been a long time since I've had a genuine ""first date experience"".

Would like to meet up with someone and experience that awkward get-to-know-you experience... if for no other reason than to remind myself of how luck I actually am. Also, because I don't really like my job and would love to meet someone that has nothing to do with my work while I'm here.

That said, I'll only really have time to meet on Thursday night. I don't have transportation, so would love to get drinks with someone at or near Fashion Island.

About me... I'm just a guy, you know. Seriously though, nothing special. I'm a mid-30's, liberal, educated, fairly intelligent (because that's not the same thing), moderately nerdy (like I am a memeber of a regular pub trivia team style nerdy), mixed-race, beer apprecianado.

I generally enjoy people who are genuine, somewhat intelligent, self-aware and drama-phobic.

If you would be interested in getting drinks with a stranger, then please respond. Othewise... don't.

Thanks

Well, it is that time of year again. I did this last year and met a wonderful person whom I consider a very close friend and we had an awesome time til she moved away. I am divorced and it is Harley riding season, and all that implies, from being lonely to being with family, travel, vacation....alone. AND LAUGHLIN RIVER RUN IS COMING!!! I know all the ""naysayers"", critics, whiners, complainers, screaming copycat etc will have a heyday with this post. All I can say is mind your own damn business and get a friggin life. I'm tryin, so should you. Anyway, that being said....Am looking for someone to travel and spend time with. JUST friends. 
NOT LOOKING FOR: 
Sex, long term, psycho, drama, baggage, gifts, life partner, loud, clingy, money grubber, smoker, alcoholic (the occassional drink is fine), drug addict, bible thumper, opinionated/argumentative, liberal, politically correct, anti-Christmas, mean, rude, or any other form of fucking nutz. 
AM LOOKING FOR:
Please be height-weight proportional (not because I am shallow, but because there is only so much room on the back seat of a motorcycle!), single/available, between 32ish and 55ish (or at least mature for your young age or very young acting/looking for your older age), and interested/avaiable for the occasional movie or dinner, or RIDE!!. Prefer someone local; say, here to maybe Tehachapi. NO STRINGS ATTACHED, REPEAT--I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A ONE NIGHT STAND OR SEX. I am not gay, just fed up with meaningless-ness!
ME: I am about 5'4"", a VERY young looking/acting 50 y.o., GREAT blue eyes, brown hair. I am self sufficient, & self confident, NOT COCKY or arrogant. Just alone. I'm not concerned about religion. Please note that I am OPPOSITE of all the stuff above that I don't want you to have. Bear that in mind!!
There's more but I will keep it for the truly interested. Email me with a couple pictures of yourself and put ""Savior?"" in the subject line. There has to be at least a microscopic physical attraction, and I understand it must go both ways. So if I don't respond after seeing you, OR YOU don't respond after seing ME, let's mutually agree we have varied tastes. I will return you with a picture and then you will have a chance to run away!! I'm just making sure you are real, and not my ex! I know this is a longshot, but bear in mind that life is a longshot. So WTH. Right?! Have a great day!

Please read this ad carefully. I am a gentleman who seeks a lady only. However, this is about being platonic and recreational. We will not be dating. Besides, who really seeks strangers online for that purpose? It seems more like a TV script to me. Please be of drinking age. Other than that, how old we are shouldn't matter. If that's an issue, then skip my ad.

So, I am not using board games as subterfuge. You will be safe... Do not ask me for my picture, and refrain from replying if you have no interest in chess. No endless e-mail, either. Why should we waste our time?

A round of chess could be very fun. Oddly enough, I never see men and women sharing a game. When I was growing up, boys and girls were allowed to spend time together with simple activities, but alas, there was never enough time. It was a giant disappointment. We grew up and got very busy with so many things. Life should never be too serious.

Again, this is platonic as listed. However, no mystery ladies who never want to meet in person, please. If you know that you will always be ""too busy working,"" then refrain from replying.

Hi there!

I'm a 25 year old female looking for another gal to workout with! It doesn't have to be at a gym, we could go hiking, biking, walking--whatever! Age, race, and body type don't matter. If you'd rather work out in a gym setting I would pay for your membership at my local gym. 

Hope to hear from you soon! :)

Yo! What's up people? I'm hanging out around North OC to SGV looking for good conversation. I would like to chill and have some bud with a individual who enjoys sophisticated stoner conversation about life, theology, food... whatever comes to mind. This is strictly platonic. I am only seeking friendship. I am laid back and down to earth, non-judgmental, and just wanting to enjoy life. Age, race, etc doesn't matter to me. Ideally, I'd like to become friends that talk on a daily basis so we can get to know each other and encourage one another in times of triumph and sorrow. 

Well, I will leave the rest up to you! Go ahead and send me a message and we'll go from there!

To everyone out there, cheers!

Once again, this is for friendship only.

Hi girls! I am a female who is in her mid 20s, very fun, outgoing, and a very down to earth kinda gal. I am hispanic and know my spanish. I get along with any race as long as you're very cool and down to earth as well. Im not a club go-er, so i just want to get that out there. Im in a very happy serious relationship and im not looking for you to be part of something, or for me to be part of something! This is strictly platonic. I have moved around alot which is why i dont have any close friends. I would like to meet someone who is kinda like me and by that, i mean someone who will enjoy doing similar things or someone who has similar likes/ dislikes as me. I don't drink alcohol and i am 420 friendly but the last time i smoked was last year lol. I am very girly... Love makeup, shoes, clothes, handbags.... Im trying to get a bit into shape so if you're on the same boat that would be awesome if not its ok. I love music but mostly indie/rock. I love festivals, museums, concerts, theme parks, the beach, hiking, trying new eating spots, watching netflix, reading, cooking, and getting my eyebrows and nails done. Im not the kind of girl that uses a friend or rarely makes time for a friend. I am not a flake, please don't be one either. I am a good friend who is there through good times and bad times :) i have my own car, no kids, i work in the evening so i have most mornings and early afternoons free. Please be mobile and real. I will voice verify and ask to meet in a public place like a Starbucks where there is plenty of people around. If anything sounded interesting to you, please shoot me an email and tell me about yourself. Send a picture to get one in return and also no men no couples and no flakes!!!

Hi! So my friend and I are going to Disneyland tomorrow, and we also have an extra ticket. But we need a ride! If you're willing to give us a ride there, we are willing to just give you our extra ticket, at no cost to you but the ride. This ticket is a peak season park hopping ticket, and it usually costs $169. Obviously the tickets are 100% real and valid because we are using two for ourselves. We could sell it, but we would rather just give it to someone willing to drive us to Anaheim. You can use the ticket all day in both Disneyland and California Adventure until they close, and you don't have to worry about driving us back; leave at your own discretion. We stay in Van Nuys, and would like to be at the park by 9. Let me know if you're interested. Thanks!

Hello craigslist,

Ive gone through a bad breakup. Ive posted an ad for companionship and have gotten a few answers which has given me some insight on how to deal with my anxiety. 


I was having a very meaningful conversation but that ended when I was unable to reply because of the ten day anonymous email limit. You were shy and just used the relay email til it ended. 


I am hoping to find a friend whom I can spend time with going out and enjoy sharing about the simple things life. 

Ifor you're going through the same ordeal I think we could help each other. 

I love hiking and other activities and have a great sense of humor. I am looking for the same. I guess a car and a job would be cool too because I have those as well. 


I hope to find you.

Hello, I got a great sofa using craigslist so why not someone to just talk to! Let's have an anonymous connection, I won't know your personal details and back. We can just virtually hang out, tell me about what's bugging you, or I'll talk to you about a very weird movie I've seen, or discuss how good steaks are and how McDonald fries are still the best. Do you like mountain climbing, or racing? I do too, but heights and unmanageable speeds are still scary. 

We can talk about our daily lives, recent problems, achievements, procrastination and anything! The point of this is just to have someone to listen or talk with because we're all stuck, or are in circles, sleeping under a busy crazy world, or stuck in the endless cycle of the day job, maybe under a busy city that never sleeps or just a lowly countryside. Whichever way, let me know, maybe we can be great anonymous penpals.

My birth year: 1990. Getting out from a conservative Asian background. I feel old... It's like I am stuck, I can't rev up the jeep, and things are in circles. I still have no idea what to do, and I am trying to figure it out, how about you?

You are needing/wanting to give and receive affection such as: touching, caressing, hugging, massaging and all involving non-sexual intimacy. Honest affection and a little TLC is the gratifying component of male to male bonding. Cuddling and enjoying each other's presence is a great way to relax and feel good. This can be for 1 hour or longer if you desire. Looking for average, h/w proportionate, clean cut Straight/Bi-curious/Gay males looking for connection and kindness with no sex. All ages are welcome. That inner child wants to feel safe and cared for, and yearns to let go of that social image for a while. Simple human touch reduces stress and anxiety, is healthy for mind, body and soul, develops trust, and is a neat way to come alive. Having a good heart is what this is all about. Affection, Friendship, Caressing, Massage, Hugging, Comfort, Respect, Trust, In-Spirit, and Feeling Safe -- Wow Terms! Let me know if there is any interest in this. I am Caucasian, h/w proportionate, understanding, and discreet looking for similar. There is never a charge since it is mutually enjoyable.

But I'm saying I want that once again, if there's someone out there that also does, well hey let's have a hang out and see if we become friends, stick as strangers , or maybe something more? And no not talking in a sexual way, the lovey dovey kinda way.
Btw , I'm 24 in July , and very embarrassed I had to make a Craigslist page , but hey I was watching new girl, look how they ended up Craigslist, worth a shot right? Aha

I'm sincerely seeking free, discounted, or for-trade massage therapy assistance in the ESFV area. I'm a safe and sane, clean white male in my 40s. I am modest and respectful, and not a flake. I am in generally good health, but lately have been suffering from a very sore muscles. I'm not necessarily into massages, being undressed in front of strangers, nor a fan of lotions (and definitely not oils), but I've been on Groupon and CL looking at my options, because I'm enough pain such that I will happily plop down and let a qualified massage therapist go at me.

I'm mobile and available this evening. I'm not sure trading massage services would be a good deal for you. ;) Perhaps you need some handyman help or a fix around the house? A ride somewhere? A drink? A little cash?

Again, I'm looking for genuine massage therapy assistance. I will respect you, your time, and your hospitality, and will conduct myself maturely and appropriately in your presence. You're in charge.

Please contact me for more info. Thanks for your consideration.

I am 51, white and an easygoing older bear type who is looking for a friend in the neighborhood. I moved to West Hollywood last July. Most of my friends live in the Silver Lake area. I had a good friend who lived on Vista here in West Hollywood but he moved to the Westside last December. One of my other good friends just recently moved back to the suburbs. To cut a long story short, I don't have any friends who live close by. I know a lot of guys make friends at the bars, but I am not really all that much into the bar scene. Once in awhile I will go to the beer bust at the Faultline or the Eagle, but that is not something that I do very often. What I am looking for is a friend who enjoys conversation and hanging and who has a wide variety of taste in music. I really enjoy music and my taste ranges from female jazz singers and classic rock to 80's underground and alternative rock. I also enjoy groups like Audioslave and Alice in Chains as well as groups like Dead Can Dance and This Mortal Coil in addition to some show tunes, some classical music, some opera and a fair amount of Gregorian chant. I am a graduate of Cal State Northridge. I have a BA in history with a minor in language. I have worked mainly as a legal secretary and an executive assistant, but am currently unemployed. I am also a published author. My first book was published last May and is a collaboration between me and a friend of mine who is a visual artists. If you like music too and would like to get together to talk, hang, have a conversation or maybe a cup of coffee or even a beer or a glass of wine, hit me up and we can trade pics and get to know each other. I live with a roommate and cannot host very often, so it would be best if we met at your place or a public place.

Why, do we go through life always wondering what if? You get married and do what is expected, you hope love is enough but in the end, love is not. So you stay and say to yourself, things will change and get better but many, many years later things are still the same. 

Now, the years have passed and you want to have at least brief moments of fulfillment.
A friend that makes you laugh so hard you cry, but of joy, not sadness. Finding, that friend that shares with your thoughts, dreams, and moments of embrace. A friend to text or email you to you throughout the day.

Will that person be you? Will you look with your heart or with your eyes? Will you be my special friend in the end?

I don't have preconceived plans if there is chemistry and we connect great, only time will tell.

Looking for someone to have fun with! What it means? I'll try to be as specific as I can... 

Someone to go out with to an existing night out or a casual brunch/dinner. Someone who'll come over to catch a good movie with popcorn, a night swim @ the pool/Jacuzzi with a bear, a partner to come with me to the gym or a run @ the beach, someone who would like to join me for an adventurous cruise on my motorcycle and so on... Anywhere in the ages of 20 - 40 is fine by me if we share the same passion. 

A little about me: white skin, green eyes, don't want to say it on myself but been told that I am an attractive guy and look good. I'm a Virgo (not sure if it's good or bad so you decide) and I hate to compromise. I'm smart and clever, clean and educated. I can be a great listener and I enjoyed deep meaningful conversations. 
I live in a very nice & luxurious hi rise with an Ocean view that feels very much like HOME. I don't smoke and will drink only when I'm out and about with friends even though I can very much enjoy a night out just with myself. 
I like to exercise, I love driving my cars fast or riding my motorcycles and generally speaking I believe that life is too short to regret and we need to have as much fun as possible. 

I can go on and on but let's save something for later...

I don't have friends really. I'm rather anti social, I like to keep to myself. I'm goofy, smart, hmmmmmm this feels ridiculous posting on Craigslist.

Have you ever reached a point, where your mind is so crowded with thoughts, ideas, words, memories; that you start to feel alone in your own flesh? That words like ""detachment"" and ""disconnect"" do not make you comfortable. That you feel a need to connect, because deep down you know we are all searching for something, yet when we see a glimpse of it, we deny it?

Sometimes I wish I could be stupid, not have as much understanding as I do today. Not be as well versed, technical and analytical as I am. That desire would take over reason, and to just let go. I've done it and been happy, but torment myself afterwards.

I, as many of you, am searching for happiness, we know what happiness is. We know that blissful feeling of a warm embrace and of a caring word. We search for happiness in our work, hobbies, friends and relationships. Has the world gone mad? I believe it has. Because no one cares to be really happy anymore. Instead we replace happiness with things and we ignore the glimpses and swipe left, block and unfriend, just because.

My reasoning is complex, and I do not expect to be figured out. How boring would that be. I want to engage in a passionate conversation that will leave us wanting more knowledge and carefully know when to stop and lay on a park under the stars and enjoy the silence.

Please hit me with your best shot. If you read this far, our minds may have something in common.

I'm Marco.

This is for men, woman and couples. 

We all have those moments where we want to take some discreet sexy picture or nude pictures for someone or even for our personal pleasure, but we just can't ask a friend or family member because we are to embarrassed with their reactions or questioning. We want it to be as discreet as possible and we want to be the only ones to know. 

Well that's where I come in to play. You contact me and we set up a time and place to take a few photos of you, this can be nude, lingerie or just regular photos for your pleasure. You provide the memory card and keep all original photos. I don't keep any copies at all. 

I'm not a perfesional photographer but I like to take photos, I have a basic canon DSLR set up for beginners. My camera takes great pictures. I can also use your phone if you would prefer that route. 

This will be discreet and for your pleasure. I offer this opportunity just so that I can practice. 

If you are interested, feel free to contact me, send me some info about you, let me know what type of photos you are looking to take and let's set something up. 

About me; Hispanic professional male, respectful of all your privacy, no drama, easy going and very open minded. You will feel very comfortable around me and can be yourself without being judged in any type of way.

Just being up front; but I'm thinking about having an affair. I guess Craigslist is the best place to bring this up haha. But I'm not sold that it's gonna be worth it or what it will even be at all. So I'm curious if some other married woman out there is in the same position as me. Maybe I just need to talk it through with someone.

Very bored at work so I'd love to text someone about it today. Maybe we'll click.

I'm 28, mixed race, average build. I have a affinity for older women, so if that sounds good to you I'd love to chat & see where we're at. Or just talk about where we both are on the matter.

I mean really, who does? Do you really think you know what makes you happy? 

I though I knew what I wanted. Thought I knew what made me happy. Somewhere along the way I've just lost sight of what's important. Do you ever feel that you aren't good enough, even though people have told you otherwise? That's me. Crazy thing is I'm in the best place I've ever been in, great job, great place to live, yet something is missing. I have friends, but I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to. I know, what guy needs to be talking about things, well I'm no regular guy. Conventional is probably the best word lol.

I do feel like I need to talk to new people. I don't know where to start. I'm the shyest outgoing person there is. It's hard for me to talk to people I don't know, but once the wall is broken down, I think I'm great to get to know. Maybe someone out there on CL is looking for someone to talk to? Who knows. 

If you don't like 28 year old guys who are grown but still have a young fun side, that are Latino but don't speak great Spanish , teddy bear type guys with a beard and a whole variety of likes including different types of music, sports and movies, you probably shouldn't message me. I'm not here to prove anything to anyone, nor am I here to judge.

Anywho, have a great night

Uhh hi, how are you? Good I hope. 
So umm, yeah okay, gotta get this started. 
The title, what I mean is do you think you can leave everything here, in cali, scratch that, in south central for a sec? Just go, get out of here, tell your family and friends that I'll be back, just gonna take a road trip. Yeah? Well I have, I want to travel, see different lands, visit historic places, laugh with different people. I love my family and enjoy my friend's company but its always the same thing. Do you feel isolated, institutionalized of the way of this life? The cali life? Do you believe that you should be free? Be the phoenix and soar? I sure as hell do. I'm sorry, I'm just rambling on and such. What I'm trying to say is: Would you like to go on an adventure with me? 

This is what I purpose: A road trip, a nation-wide road trip, going to state to state, city to city, visiting historic places and seeing new faces. Eating at amazing places like that guy from Man vs Food and taking pics while we are at it. Do crazy shit while we are young and have awesome memories to our friends and family.

Who's in charge of what: I take on the gas money and the hotel rooms we get, I pay with my own money. 
You take on the car, driving to any place which means you are in charge of the map, the food we eat meaning that you pick the restaurants or diner that we go to, if the car need some repairs while on the road then we split the pay. 

Of course, we can't do this until we get to know each other very well. What makes us happy and sad, what triggers us, basically becoming good friends before we do this. So what do you say? 

You wanna go on an adventure with me?

Divorced 33, Mexicano some what white washed. Don't think thats bad.
Dad to a beautiful lil girl 10 BTW. Yes I know cliche Hispanic working construction
M-F sometimes Sat.

Well on here to try to meet a lady as I work with all dude's. For friends or if leads more naturally cool. So I feel younger than I should. Yes what means is that I'm still into theme parks bar's and the occasional dancing to hip hop,reggeton,and of course rock en Español. But feel like a creep going without a date. Yes all my friends are busy with families as they should be. 

To pass the time I try to stay in shape know most of hiking trails in or around LA. Hit the gym herw and there and trying to get back into crossfit. But not obsessed. Into old school muscle cars and riding my motorcycle so if you ride well get along if not I don't mind a passenger. 
Don't do drugs (yes 420 is a drug) or smoke. Liquor is good enough for me nothing better than having a Michelada after a long day of work. If you don't know what that is is your missing out. I'm a big foodie and willing to try almost anything 

So if you think we could have some stuff in common want to talk the shit. Or want to drive down to TJ or Ensenada for tacos. Hmu @

I am a 26 year old girl who loves to dance. Preferably to Banda music. I am seeking a dance partner (strictly platonic) who is also in their 20s, who is light on their feet and knows how to lead; someone who would consider themselves a good dancer. I am looking for someone who lives locally (in the LA area -- preferably within 15 miles of 90242) and is up for going out to dance whenever I have some free time. I am 5'7"" and a half, so I would also like someone taller than me. I prefer older Banda music, such as Julio Preciado and Banda El Recodo. If interested, please reply with your name, some of your favorite Bandas, any local places that you know of that plays good Banda music and a photo. Thank you!

Hey there. Or alternatively, as we say back east, ""Peace."" Heh. I keep mentioning my roots, but to level with you I've lived in L.A. on and off for years. I'm visiting a friend in Glendale(fyi, I'm Italian and German, not Armenian, lol). They have an impromptu accounting contract they're working on this afternoon, so that means I'm free-floating on my own for the remains of the day. 

Having had more than my fill of the Americana and Galleria over extended periods of time, I thought I'd head out here for the afternoon and see what kind of mischief I can get into. Looking for a partner in crime(getting tipsy) - you game?

And now for a few things you should know before you respond:

I'm a bit coarse in my NYC-esque manliness and need a delicate little flower to properly balance out my surly/brawny energy. I probably look like a brawler, but as it turns out I have the intellect to go along with it, so do not be fooled. I am well-versed on many an obscure topic. I am definitely not the typical, safe, Burbank conversation.

Straight up - let's hang out girl. I definitely am a lot of fun, not looking to go to bed, and just would dig some chill company today. You want to swoon? Do you truly deserve effortless charm and grace? If yes, I shan't disappoint. Just make sure you don't either. Very important.

Above all else, do -not- be a kid. Secondly, don't think a cute face is enough. In my unique case, it's not. My rivers run concertedly deeper. I am seeking an element much harder to find than a nice smile.

Someone humble, well-mannered, emotionally open, and without 10 walls up. In short I need a real human being. Not a typically catty prima donna L.A. clone. Of which there are a plethora in this coffee shop alone.

If you are true quality you will be treated like gold. My solemn word on that. 

As another aside, I am a freelance web content writer and work exclusively and full-time from my laptop. I am not a plastic, sheltered, foofy person. I am blue-collar and highly mature by nature. I don't care if you work as an executive for a corporation or at the local diner as a waitress. A person is defined by their actions, not their career. Hopefully you -get- that. Only the wiser ones truly will I'd surmise.


Anyway, I'll be out here for about the next 5 hours or so, so if you can get out here or live close and don't mind walking(smartest option, trust), text me a picture and we'll catch up with each other in just a bit somewhere in Burbank. Maybe grab a bite, get a drink, who knows. We'll play it by ear. Just don't be broke and unable to pay your tab. That's not my speed in a woman. 


In closing, everything above you've just read is as accurate as humanly possible. No tricks, no games, absolutely no lies. Make sure you present yourself in a similar manner is all I really ask. Much appreciated.


See you soon,

I'm starting all over and looking for a few gal pals to connect with. 

I've had my share of restarts. 
After college? Check! 
Career change? Check! 
Significant other cheated? Check!
Baby? Check!

It has been a wild and wonderful life but at the end of the day, I miss having some gal pals. So what happened? The usual. Friends moved away. Interests changed. In a rare case or two, I simply lost touch. 

One would think that technology has made it easier for people to connect. In theory, this would be true. In reality, it is far from correct. During my spare time, I sing with my eyes closed and the music turned up loud. Yes! That really happens. Favorite music? I'm all over the place. From Taiko drums, to the magnificent voice of China Forbes. <-- If you haven't discovered her, google her. She speaks a few different languages and her voice is like silk.

I also am a gardening enthusiast. <--Sounds granola, I know. I'm motivated by the delicious pleasure of eating something right after it has been picked from a tree or pulled from the ground. My green onions would make Hulk Hogan weep. I am kookoo crazy about NASA and all things related to SPACE. 

I have a 4 year old daughter who owns my soul. Although my daughter will never know this. I am a tough disciplinarian who doesn't believe in spanking but instead relies on Dan Siegel's ""No Drama Discipline"" to navigate the woes of toddler. 

I'm throwing this out there. If it doesn't work, maybe I'll find a bunch of groups to join like the dude in Fight Club. Worked for him, right? 

Age: Almost 40 and proud of it. Most people think I am an my early 30s and I am quick to correct them. Every day is a blessing, and I can only hope to live to 100. 

Ethnicity: That is an interesting one. Guess.

Looks: I can't believe this is even an issue. Attractive enough to still be asked out by men (and sometimes women) even though there is definitely a ring on this finger.

Favorite food: Hah! That is easy, potatoes. Fried, baked, in a soup? I'm there. Poutine is my favorite way of eating potatoes.

Drugs: Eh, not for me. No judging. I'm serious about living to 100. One bad trip or getting something that is laced will totally ruin that effort.

Tattoos: Definitely sexy. But not for me. I'll admire them from a distance.

Sexuality: Gay all the way. But not the in your face, flag waving, card carrying, lets go to West Hollywood type. Most people are like. Ah-ha! I thought so but was not sure.

OK, that is enough for now. If I sound interesting enough, let's connect.

Looking at the weather outside and knowing t's going to be cold and rainy tonight just makes me think of how much I wish I had someone to cuddle up to when I get home. But since I'm single, I thought I'd check to see if there's a nice and attractive woman out there feeling the same way who would want to get together tonight. I'm not expecting to get laid or anything like that, but I miss the intimacy of having someone to hold. I'm thinking some wine, a good movie, or good conversation just sounds great to go with it.

Let's meet up and have dinner, talk and get to know each other, and if we're both comfortable with it, get a little closer. I'm a 42 year old, tall, slender, attractive white man, clean cut with light features. I do have pictures to share and hope you do as well. You'll find me to be intelligent, funny, kind, respectful, honest, and a lot of fun to hang around with. I have a job I love, great family and friends, and a nice place in Burbank where I live alone. I've just found it's been a little lonely lately.

Has technology made us any happier? 

Well, I can objectively say that not having to remember my friends' phone numbers has made it easier for me to fill my head with more (some times useless) information. I also have half a docen folders with backed up photos from every time my iphone runs out of memory. I can now see exactly what that night two years ago looked like, and any clouded memory I had of it is meaningless, because I don't need to depend on transient impressions anymore. But, is that objectively good?

I can't objectively say that it has made me a better person. The time that I've saved searching for information in google instead of a physical dictionary hasn't really improved the quality of my researches. As a matter of fact, I now rely more on the promptness of google than I am confident of my ability to recall something from my own memory. 

Craigslist's format suits my antiquated preferences to establish a connection with another person. It reminds me of the days when the internet was still a black box of surprises, and people needed to work on their personalities (or at least grammar) to make a good impression, rather than leaving that task to a photo. This semi-analog platform allows one to do more with less. We could infect these blank canvases with a few yellow icons and expect them to convey our mood, but I'd prefer to rely only on these sterile characters to make you, ambiguous reader, shape these sentences in the way it best suit you. I hope I've stimulated your imagination more than if I had uploaded a selfie.

Let's take advantage of this analog platform and use it accordingly: there's always facebook and instagram to upload photos. Take a chance to get to know someone without expectations.

Hello! So this may be a long-shot but I'm seeking long distance friendship with someone in the LA area. I am currently living in Atlanta but I love to travel a lot and I like having friends all over the country and the world that I like to visit, not just in Atlanta. I like to change things up. For now, this would be long-distance friendship, but eventually it would be great to meet up every few months or so in LA or perhaps you can visit me on the east coast if you'd like. I don't plan on living in Atlanta forever, so it's possible I may very well be moving in the future! If you're looking for a change of scenery every now and then, as well as great friendship (as I often do), then please contact me. We can communicate via phone, text, social media regularly until we decide to meet. I hope to hear from those who may be interested. Take care! 💋

Hey Guys.

So Im just oging to be blunt.

I recently broke it off with a guy i was madly in love with, but for my own heart and sanity, I had to let it go because he obviously didnt see it the same way.

In this, i found that I dont really have that many friends. But i think what i need is to find a person/peoples that who i can talk to throughout the day, Texting and such. 

I know, im probably needy. But I like giving people attention too. I have issues, then again who doesnt.

So if you think we may kick it off, hanging out, going out to new places to eat, having a fun weekend drinking and doing kareoke(badly might i add), then lets talk? 

Im not much of a looker either, but if you can bare to see yourself in public with this. we will be fine

. . . with emphasis on ""Quality.""

Do you have good character, an education, a heart, a working brain, and show up on time? We know that's difficult to find in LA, so here's our chance to meet. Let's hike, perhaps become friends, and maybe find other interests to share as well (biking, boating, creative activities, adventure, photography, music, real communication, etc.) For those who have asked, platonic means platonic, but later if we click I might be open to a relationship since the best ones start out as friendships anyway. But this is about hiking and friendship, and I have no ulterior agenda. It shouldn't matter as friends or hiking partners but I'm tall, fit, a SWM, and get called ""handsome"" or ""good looking"" so you know I don't need to be here -- rather, I want to use this opportunity to screen for higher quality people than I'd meet randomly around this town. If you long for more substantial company, as I do, here's our chance.

I'm pretty skilled at massage, though not formally trained. Had a couple of friends along the way who were massage therapists and they taught me a few things. I've got fairly strong, sensitive hands and can give you a nice long massage while finding all of your trouble spots (even ones you might not have suspected). I need the same treatment, though, and can't do it to myself. 😊 I'd like to find a female friend who can give me a full body massage in exchange for receiving one. In particular, I've got a spot in my right leg and glute that is causing me a lot of problems.

I'm a swm, professional, workout regularly (which is what is causing the problem), laid back and fun. I'd like to find a female who is also reasonably active, caring, fun, and laid back to do this with. We can use my place or yours, though I'd suggest we meet in person someplace public first to make sure we are both comfortable. I use coconut oil for massages, but if you've got something else you prefer (or have an allergy), bring it along when we meet.

-I love to make others laugh and be silly and goofy. I am considered to be the class clown. -Life is too short to waste it on negative things. 
-Not too much into sports unless UCLA and/or USC plays. 
-Not as physically active as I should be, but I am working on it this year. #2016goals

Lastly, I am seeking a friendship with someone with similar interests to mine. Hook ups are not my priority. Let's start off as friends and take it from there. I am not a superficial type of guy nor someone that sets expectations of education, background, age, race, or professionalism. Straight, married, bi? Open to all.

Myself and a buddy are into MMF, Gangbangs and Bukake. We are more on the professional side, reliable, clean cut, safe, sane, DDF and fun. We are seeking ladies and couples who are interested in these activities. It can be a one time thing and or if we mesh ongoing. We would like to find a core group of ladies/couples for ongoing biweekly and or monthly parties. Discretion, maturity, abiding by limits and having a good time are hallmarks of what we seek. 

I've had to edit this because of the responses, fakes and flakes. What I need from you if you respond.

- Dates you will be in LA if traveling to here.
- If you reside here, what days and times are you usually available.
- Your age and stats.
-Your likes, dislikes and definitely any hard limits.
-Do you want an MMF or how many many men you'd ideally like to attend.

- Of course, photos and emails go to the head of the line.
- One liners such as ""I'm interested,"" will most likely be deleted. 
- I can make this happen today but usually....Today, tonight, ASAP, Now, at times can be done but are an exception not the rule. It takes time to see when people are available. Flash news! There are not a group of guys sitting around the computer waiting for someone to say ""Yeah, I want to do this and now."" If there is, best of luck to you with guys who have that kind of time and no job. 

If I come off as sarcastic....Well, if you could read some of the responses I receive and the number of people who flake. lol

Have a great day to all! :-)

Single, relaxed and easy going guy looking for help with healthier meal planning, grocery shopping and most importantly, teaching me how to cook it.

Not looking for a sexual thing, but open to developing a relationship if it goes that way! I'm honest, straightforward, drama free and live a simple straightforward life.

I'm reasonably intelligent and a good teacher. 25 years ago, I learned 3 simple rules that changed my life when it comes to studying and learning, so if you are having any difficulties in that area, I'm sure I can help you out. I'm really serious about that too, very simple to learn and implement and truly life changing!

I'm also good at building and fixing things, and totally willing to help you with anything you might need in that department. I've also been a car guy my whole life and while the new ones have become way too complex for the casual guy to trouble shoot in-depth problems, basic stuff like brake jobs, oil changes, and tune-ups haven't changed and are still fundamentally the same. Even if it's something I can't handle, my knowledge and life experience can help stop you from being ripped off! I just saw an auto body repair/paint job on a vehicle the other day that was so horrible, it looked like it was done by a kindergartner!

I have pictures to share if you want to know what I look like, let me know..

Hey guys, I'm Bri and I'm looking for an awesome guy to get fit with and become friends with. I just recently bought P90X3 and im looking for someone who will make it fun, competitive, and keep each other motivated :) I'm also thinking of getting a cheap gym membership from planet fitness but I have no idea how to work out properly or use all those dang machines lol. I'm actually pretty goofy so somebody with a great sense of humor is more than welcome to come join me on my fitness journey. I also have a new years resolution to try at least one new fun thing a month (Groupon and living social are going to be my new best friends lol) so it would be awesome to have a great friend to join me on my adventures! Let's get to know each other and start as soon as possible.

I am 51, white and an easygoing older bear type who is looking for a friend in the neighborhood who is passionate about music. I moved to West Hollywood last July. Most of my friends live in the Silver Lake area. I had a good friend who lived on Vista here in West Hollywood but he moved to the Westside last December. One of my other good friends just recently moved back to the suburbs. To cut a long story short, I don't have any friends who live close by. I know a lot of guys make friends at the bars, but I am not really all that much into the bar scene. Once in awhile I will go to the beer bust at the Faultline or the Eagle, but that is not something that I do very often. What I am looking for is a friend who enjoys conversation and hanging and who has a wide variety of taste in music. I really enjoy music and my taste ranges from female jazz singers and classic rock to 80's underground and alternative rock. I also enjoy groups like Audioslave and Alice in Chains as well as groups like Dead Can Dance and This Mortal Coil in addition to some show tunes, some classical music, some opera and a fair amount of Gregorian chant. I am a graduate of Cal State Northridge. I have a BA in history with a minor in language. I have worked mainly as a legal secretary and an executive assistant, but am currently unemployed. I am also a published author. My first book was published last May and is a collaboration between me and a friend of mine who is a visual artists. If you like music too and would like to get together to talk, hang, have a conversation or maybe a cup of coffee or even a beer or a glass of wine, hit me up and we can trade pics and get to know each other. I live with a roommate and cannot host very often, so it would be best if we met at your place or a public place.

I am looking for a guy friend to hang out with. We can work out together, go out to eat, or go on adventures. We can also do homework together! I know. That's a little nerdy, but I need my degree. 

It would be cool to have someone to watch sports with. It's a plus if you like the Thunder and the Patriots. :) But I'm okay with friendly competition. 

I'm a sweet and kind. It takes a bit for me to come out of my shell, but I'm a lot of fun when I finally do. I love to cook and bake. I'd love to get back into dancing. I do want to travel a lot more within the next few years. 

I work with kids, and it'll be nice to have an adult to hang out with.

Hi there,
I'm 22, full Filipino, and petite. I work and go to school full-time. In a relationship, no kids. I am also mobile, I would like you to be too. I'd also like you to be in the 21-25 range, just because we're more likely to have things in common.
I am married and not looking for anything more than friendship. I know 22 is on the younger side to be married, but I promise I am just your typical 22 year old lol. Just found the right guy early on 😊 My husband is my best friend, but sometimes I just miss having a girl to do girly things with lol. Like shopping, getting our nails done, beach days, movie marathons, going to happy hour etc. I'm also into fitness so if you have a gym membership or like to go hiking/ bike riding that's a plus! I'm an LA fitness member. I like to take care of myself, appearance and health, and would like to meet others who do the same. Also, I'm obsessed with my fur babies. 🐰🐩
I am super bubbly, easygoing, loyal, fun and really want to build a strong friendship. Moved to the area about a year ago, but its been hard to meet people aside from my work/ school friends. 
Email me with a few things about yourself, and either your fb or ig account so I can verify that you're not a crazy person lol.

I am a male CMT with specializations in deep tissue, acupressure, trigger point, and Swedish massage. Over the years of helping people with massage therapy, I realized a massage works when there is a connection between the mind and body of both the therapist and client. I created the Body and Mind Synergy Bodywork (BMSB) model solely for this purpose. The BMSB model is a combination of four modalities aforementioned, and it seeks to enhance the cognitive process by applying a range of muscular manipulations, from very deep to light touches, deliberately and appropriately. The kneads and strokes are applied slowly and continuously. The result is relaxing, yet invigorating.

If you'd like to get a private BMSB massage, contact me for more details. Incalls/Outcalls welcome. Please be serious when you contact me.

Do you have kids between the ages of 5-10 who could use a friend? 

My daughter is homeschooled, and she would Love to find a friend or two (boys and girls) for playdates, drop offs, field trips, park days, you name it. 

She's turning 8 this year, and gets along with boys & girls. It's just been hard finding a friend she can grow up with and see on a regular basis. 

Please let me know how old your child is and maybe let's set a day for them to meet at the park.

Looking to make a new friend in the northridge area. I'd like to find a friend to go out for dinner, drinks, movies, travel, etc. and have a fun time or just stay in and have a cozy night. I'm kinda bored of the party for 1 scene or being a third wheel. I do work and go to school I'm on my last semester for my Bachelors degree. I'm not a party type person, I'm really laid back, a gentleman, and like to laugh. I'd hope to find a girl who's looking for a friend maybe more if we click but someone who is also laid back and enjoys the occasional night out. Someone with a sense of humor, loyal, and also looking to do good in life and be successful. I am 420 friendly if you are but not important. I'll send a picture if you send one. I'm a clean guy, have my own place and car. Send me a little about yourself if interested.

As a single guy it is difficult to understand what goes on during your period. Menstruation is very taboo in our society. Is it just in the back ground, do you plan around it, and are you embarrassed when you buy products for it (I assume not).

Talking about what a great kisser you are is like saying how funny you are. You're probably not. If we have a connection we'll find out. This place is not the ideal place to meet people but I always think there must be normal people out there that truly want a LTR. That really don't want their girlfriends to send full frontal pics on the first CL interaction. I might be wrong. I hope I am.

I am feminine, confident, with a sense of aesthetic and humor and love all things girly.

I have a strong personality and speak my mind, but I am also altruistic, dependable and 
a loyal friend, who will have your back, ala SATC girls, which is hard to find in LA LA
land.

Reply with something about you, where you live, and a picture, to see if we're compatible.
( NO pic, NO reply!) I am looking for an ""accomplice"" who is dependable, attractive, fun, 
either my age, or younger. I don't act, feel, or dress my age. I am late 40's. Please be close
to Weho (15 min) I keep getting a lot of replies from women who live far away. Close by is
Beverly Hills, Miracle Mile, Los Feliz, Silverlake, Mid-City, Korea Town and Down Town.

Hello Ladies:
If you are a painter or a photographer interested in finding in a model to pose for you I'm available. If you are interested in partial or fully nude subjects I am OK with that. If you are interested in erotica, or if you want to involve an additional person (or people) of either sex I'm open to that as well. PLEASE NOTE: This is strictly about the art for me, NOTHING ELSE. You may have a friend or (female) assistant in attendance of you prefer. I DO NOT CHARGE for my service - I simply enjoy posing for art. You don't need to be a professional - I will pose for students and beginners as well. I am also open to a posing for small groups of photographers and artists, and I am open to virtually any subject so feel free to ask. All I ask in return is samples of the finished artwork. I'm friendly, very easy-going and sincere so don't be shy. Lets make some art together!

I am looking for someone that has depression like me. I have friends, car, and a band. But I really don't care because I want to tell you all the information I have learned from all the scientific articles and books I have read. You can fight your depression if you want, but if I see you have good intentions I will let you witness my suicide. I don't need help, just someone a friend with depression just like me.

The tone and direction of your massage is completely and utterly under your control. Your massage will be therapeutic in nature, but there is always the possibility of a sensual finish, should you desire that. No reciprocation is required unless the mood strikes.
My hands masterfully and methodically knead and caress your entire body and work their way to your lower back and tailbone area, you feel a deep relaxing sensation, coupled with a very unique and delightful tingle that stirs your entire body into a wonderful place of ecstasy. You are in paradise.
My hands move lower to massage and explore the globes of your round buttocks. As they do, you find yourself fighting not to allow your hips to rise up into my touch. Each of my massage stroke continues to create a ever building pleasure, that causes your to quiet moans to become more frequent and your breathing to become much heavier.........
I look forward to pleasuring you exactly as you have always dreamed. Write ""me time"" or ""massage"" when responding, something so I know that you are not spam.
Also, no one liners, give a little info about yourself. Don't be shy, if you are older, younger, bigger, smaller. I am not judgmental.

I've been an avid reader, occasional poster and extremely rare responder of the Craigslist personals for about a year now, and I've noticed some common (and hilarious) threads of interest among the women of LA. I'd like to take a minute to break it down for you, ghetto style, so you can recognize the following horrific cliches and just maybe avoid getting flagged as spam.

ReadySetGo!!!!

""Seeking a man that's at least 6 feet tall. I like to wear high heels"" -- Damn, totally boned here. I'm only 5'7' or maybe 5'8′, apparently equaling ""somewhere between midget and elf, and therefore undatable"", even though the average American male height is 5'10. And 6 feet tall? What kind of shoes are you wearing anyway? Some shit from the lunar landing? Next. . .

""Looking for a God-fearing man"" -- I get the biggest kick out of this one. Why would you be afraid of your own imaginary friend? Seems like you'd better imagine something a little less hostile. I'd suggest Papa Smurf.

""Must like the outdoors"" -- Barring a select few dweebs I've met that live in their parents' basement and mainline Mountain Dew so they can play World of Warcraft for 87 hours straight, most human beings like being outside at some point. Sure, I'll go for a day hike with you. Does that mean I want to live in the woods for a month and wipe my ass with a pine cone? No thanks!

""Looking for friends first"" -- Cool, I'm always down for more friends. Wait, what's that you say? Your hot friend Brittany is single? Excuse me while I ask her for her phone number.

""Must love children"" -- Unlike the mighty lion (who will kill and eat cubs from rival males) I say the more kids, the better! We can open our own sweatshop and they can make you shoes. I call being the manager!

""I like having fun"" -- Whew, what a relief! I'm meeting too many people these days that think having fun sucks. I'm a big fan of fun myself! We have so much in common.

""Must like to dance"" -- Really? Have you ever met a straight guy that wants to go dancing? Wait, I take that back. I do know one guy, but he's from Puerto Rico or something. Come to think of it, he's probably gay. That's right, Jorge -- I've got you figured out.

""I like going out, but also enjoy staying in for a quiet night at home"" -- That's great, because staying home or going out and doing something are pretty much the only two options you have.

So in conclusion, I say the luck of the Irish be with you lovely ladies of LA in your search for a badass Daniel Craig-era James Bond lookalike that will dance the Macarena with Mr. Cuddlekins the Poodle whilst purchasing you an all-expenses-paid vacation to Maui. Just keep in mind that Mr. Bond is only 5'10.

That being said, let's enjoy a scotch and make fun of people tonight. Done.

Hello possible future friends!

I'd like to find a great group of friends who I can actually call friends. To get together a few times a week or month for dinners, shows, happy hour, brunch, jacuzzi, bars and occasionally clubs. But on the average day I would just have some good conversation and good food. I'm straight and just looking for friends and nothing else.

Looking to be friends with down to earth, drama free, silly/sarcastic, not judgmental girls or guys that don't seem to exist in LA 


Things I enjoy doing: hiking, sailing, biking, exploring LA, the beach, theater shows, comedy clubs, live music, movies, theater shows, cooking, travel. 

Please include a picture and info about yourself and what city you live in and when you are usually free to hang out.

Instagram Facebook is a plus.

Hi! I'm a workaholic, and hardly go out. Besides, where and how does a single woman over 35 meet potential new friends after college? Friends who aren't gay , don't smoke, don't do drugs, don't like 420, and don't get drunk?

I'm an intelligent, well-spoken, educated and classy woman who enjoys the outdoors, occasional shopping, reading, blogging & occasional eating out at Asian restaurants with a grade A! :)

I'm independent , a great listener, and a bit of an out - of - the - box thinker. I like keeping a low - key & quiet lifestyle.

If you are the same in lifestyle & want to make a new friend to go out to eat with, please introduce yourself to me. No one liners. 

I live alone , so I would love to have a dining buddy especially if if you like vegan and/or Asian food!

Absolutely no smokers. I'm also highly sensitive to perfumes and any strong scents or odors. 

Mature women over 35 are welcome.

So I'm posting on here to meet some new peeps. This is strictly platonic and just looking for people that I can actually connect with. Even though its a big city, i find it a bit hard to make friends. 

A bit about myself...I live on my own with a four legged creature and currently employed so you don't have to worry about me smooching off you. I like to go out and try new things. I'm into hiking, kayaking, concerts, raves, video games, binge watching tv show/movie and food. I'm pretty open minded to various outlooks in life and really don't let things get to me. 

If you're looking for someone to talk to or just to go do things, i will rarely flake. If I make a commitment, be assured that I will follow through. I'm 420 friendly and really don't care if you are or not. I really don't care about race or whatever, just be a sane person. I'm not looking for drama and just searching for chill folks to hang out and have some fun.

Hi ladies! I'm a 32 year old black female. Single with no children. I moved to the valley last year to be closer to work but I haven't made very many friends and I'm sooo tired of being bored especially on the weekends. I'm a pretty cool chick with a great, fun personality (if I do say so myself, lol). I like going out to eat, hiking, the beach, working out, going to the movies, shopping, The Grove, sporting events, brunch, bars, or even just staying home and watching movies or something. All of those things would be much more fun if I had some girl friends to do it with! And I love trying new things. 

If you're a female and looking for a good friend, send me an email and let's go have lunch on this rainy Saturday. 

Hope to hear from you soon:)

I love this weather. Nothing like the sound of rain 
pattering the trees. 

I'll be on the puter much of the day catching up from 
a busy work-week, and wondering if someone would like 
to talk.....meaning email. 

I am highly educated, a great listener, nice looking if it matters
and not looking for nookie.

Hello...

I am interested in talking to someone who either is Dominant, or
curious about that side of herself. 

I wonder about the submissive side and while I have no expectation of anything 
happening, it would be nice to discuss this world with an open-minded soul.

Thank you and hope you're enjoying the rain!!!

Two wizards are seeking a Ravenclaw and a Slytherin to join us in creating a new YouTube channel, covering all things about the magical realm. From Aurors to Zonko's, join us as we delve into the books, theme parks and movies of Harry Potter. 

Ideally, we're looking for someone who is not shy being in front of a camera, can communicate in English (even if it's a second or third language!) and loves all things Potter. Also, you would of course have access to recording equipment and would be willing to commit to an upload schedule. We are based in the U.S., but we want to work with witches and wizards from anywhere in the world!

I went to see a movie recently, and one of the previews was for Demolition staring Jake Gyllenhaal. It's about having your life torn down and the process of rebuilding it. I think we can all relate, right?

A little about me. I work in Finance, I'm Asian, I'm 38, I'm originally not from LA. I'm a little cynical, but I'm a nice person. I'm not religious, but I'm very ""spiritual""... which is very cliche, but that's OK. I'm happy most of the time, but depressed about 20% of the time, but almost never show it. I'm single, I wish I wasn't, and at the same time this is a completely platonic request. I'm about 15 lbs over weight, I work out, but not as much as I would like. I work too much, and enjoy my work. I only read non-fiction books, and like to surf the web. I'm not a fancy personal at all, and most of the time I wear Jeans and a T-shirt. Overall, I'm a pretty normal guy.

If you're interested, please tell me a little bit about yourself.

Just what the ad says Im looking for a buddy or buddies. This may not be the ideal place to look for friends but then again what is? I just am finding myself going through a tough time in life. I am new to this area im on my own. Independent (job, car, place). And I really have been feeling very much by myself. The problem is I LOVE going out I just don't want to go out alone and that's what stops me. I have hardly any family and no friends and I just find myself wondering why no one wants me around or invites me out anywhere. It's put me in a down attitude makes me sad. I walk around hurting everyday because of it and im not sure where to go to meet people so im trying here.
im 28 years young, African American, average build, masculine, fairy good looking very ambitious works hard but plays harder. Keeps a positive mindframe regarding life and the world. A big kid at heart, educated, goal oriented, motivated. And a down right just kool go-with-the-flow type of dude. It would really be nice to meet some friends it would do my heart so much good to have a friendship and mske memories with someone. Someone who gets me 100%. I just want to be understood by somebody I've always felt misunderstood by people. Some of the things I like to do: bowling, having conversation, amusement parks, attractions/events, road trips, museums, concerts, out to eat, karaoke, the beach, working out, shopping.

Hello, 

We are an educated, sane, respectful married Latin Couple that have a demanding career and family life. We are very secure, fun and outgoing and look forward to our monthly date nights. 

We have realized that we are really social beings and we enjoy the company of others. Unfortunately, they see our kindness and the wifeys flirtatious and playful attitude as odd and, well, unacceptable. Obviously we are very open minded. 

We have also realized that we tend to get along better with men who are Latino, Educated, respectful and very humourous, not to mention flirtatious or receptive to the wife's attitude of pushing the envelope. 

So, we are seeking the following: 

YOU MUST BE: Latino, educated, between 35 and 40 years old, respectful, receptive and open minded, at least 5'8"" tall (wife is 5'7"" with heels!), must like to dance, Clean cut, easy on the eyes, and not afraid to pursue as a long term friendship. We dont care if your married, attached or single, we can practice discretion. Although you must be able to get out on Friday or Saturday nights for some dancing, happy hour/light drinking or coffee/tea meet. 

Wife is 40 years old, 5'4"" tall (5'7"" with heels), very small curvy BBW, size 10, loves heels, loves to dance to 80's hip hop, freestyle, KROQ 80's, Rock in Español and Salsa. She is well educated and is into deep yet humorous conversations. Loves to be able to message throughout the week (email only, will explain later, no phone # exchanges so please dont ask). 

Hubby is STRAIGHT, Latino, 42 years old, Educated, sane, and very open minded. Im very respectful and enjoy a night on the town with the wifey. I enjoy watching her dance and grind with a male friend and seeing the relationship evolve into more than just bar hopping or club dancing. Im best described as an observer. 

Please send us a G-rated, clear face picture, a worthy introduction (she will be reading the response and replying), your current situation, experience and age and height. On the subject line of the email, please enter or type HEELS so that we know you read this ad thouroughly and understand it. 

Planning to go out sometime soon for datenight, would like to correspond before then so that we may meet you in person. 

Once again. Reply with a G-Rated clear Face and Body picture, on the SUBJECT line type HEELS and include a worthy and catchy introduction. 

Hope to meet you soon ;)

Im looking for an awesome chick that also needs a beach running buddy! We can go mornings, nights, afternoons, whenever.. I just need a little bit of motivation and consistency. I want to start getting in better shape for the summer and it would be cool to find somebody with a similar goal. Hopefully you can keep up!! I have a lot of stamina, but I'll tone it down for the right person hahah. Also, if by any chance you also have a 24 hour gym membership, we can also go there and exercise, not necessarily together but just show up there together or meet there and do our own thing or whatever.
With all this being said, I really have no expectations of anything developing other than friendship/companionship. I dont really care if you have a boyfriend/husband whatever, just be cool and respectful and ill do the same in return.
Me: 24, work, drive, live near Manhattan Beach, no kids, average body, but can still run a mile in a little over 6 minutes. Relaxed and chill personality, 420 friendly! Especially before a run. A bit nerdy, learning electric guitar, big walking dead fan, Seinfeld, ( you double dipped the chip!) long ish curly ish hair, cheekbones, Im aright looking I guess, but that doesnt matter does it? 
You: cool female, no drama, near Manhattan Beach, and ready to sweat!!

Hey I'm looking for a cook. My work schedule makes it so I'm working 48-72 hours straight. I'm often too busy for meal prep. That's where you come in. 

Drop by, we buy the groceries together and you cook while I study/prepare for drills at work. We can hang out and chat too, but the cooking would be a great help. I'll pay hourly. 

Not looking for anything professional. I eat really clean and need to stay in shape for work, plus I'm just big into fitness. 

Just be sane, laid back, know about healthy cooking, and appealing to the eyes and we'll get along just fine.

A tradition unlike any other. The Masters golf tournament. And what a great weekend to watch it. It is supposed to rain in LA Saturday and Sunday. What could be more enjoyable for golf fans than to close the curtains, doff the clothes, go au natural, enjoy a libation or 2 or 3, and watch one of the greatest golf tournaments.

I'm looking to enjoy it with female and male golf fans that are also nudists. We can't go outside in the rain nude (well, we could and it would be enjoyable, but that would ruin my scenario). I am a newbie nudist but thoroughly enjoy the freedom. I'm still not sure about being naked around strangers, but getting there. I'm looking for at least a mw couple. I am straight and not interested in m2m contact. Being around other nude men is fine, but also want to learn to be comfortable naked around females.

I am a mature (60+) male, clean, hwp, ddf, a gentleman, fun to be with. I can come to your place or if you know of a place, that's fine. Just please be near Covina (no more than 10 miles). 

Let's enjoy the Masters, are own bodies, and begin a new tradition unlike any other.

Do you play music?

Have an easygoing and open personality?

Were looking for a buddy to hang out, drink some beer/wine and jam. Were don't take ourselves too seriously but are dedicated to sounding better. My friend and I are childhood friends so we ideally are looking for someone who meshes well. Also MUST live in Long Beach (its hard to meet last minute when you are not super close also parking is terrible here and we walk to each others apartments) 

We have very different taste in music one of us more pop and another more indie.
My friend is the singer/ songwriter
I play base/guitar (but only own an acoustic guitar)

Basically need additional instruments to add to our happy duo. We would love someone who owns a cajon!

We would love to meet for a happy hour first to see if we get along :)

I'm a 33 year old married guy who's feeling pretty danged lonely. Between work, kids and all of life's stresses, it's just not easy sometimes. 

Are you feeling the same? 

I'm looking for a woman, 20s-30s, preferably with kids, but it doesn't matter, who's looking to sit and talk about life, society, love, intimacy, quantum electrodynamics and path functions, teenaged angst, sports, Plato, ninja turtles, why I've never watched Doctor Who, or anything else that pops into our brains. Heck, I could even psychoanalyze you, or me, or your crazy kids. 

I'll bring the beers, firewood, blankets and cover parking, cause I'm a gentleman. 

I've got a nice face, sense of humor, awesome high fives, and a good dash of wit and sarcasm.

I am NOT looking for sex. I just get along better with women. I'll probably hug you if we click, though, cause I'm like that. 

If anyone is free tonight, I'm game. 

Send your favorite beer (or drink or soda) in the title, along with something witty, a little about you, maybe a pic, whatever else you think is relevant in the email body. 

Here's to hoping I end up tonight talked out, soaking wet, cold, but with with a warmed heart and new friend, and vice versa.

Seeking someone who is of a different spirit.....

I like the truth. It quickly sets us with people that we should be with and immidiately separates us from people that we should not be with.

Deep is the place to be and it has been said ""Deep calleth unto deep""...the challenge is to keep the shallow from screaming at you to come back all the time""...One must overcome the shallow in order to win the deep...it's not the other way around!

I have been all over this planet from Australia to Russia......

I am content in whatever state I am in and being sigle is a lovely way of life. 

I don't ""feed"" on Television.

I plan to be spontaneous~! 

""Kinship""...Kinship is that stage when you speak of the things that matter to you and the other person says...""Yea~!...ME Tooooooo""

I have lived in Santa Monica since 2001...I am normal~!

I host a daily Podcast. This is my life. This is my work. I address life in the invisible spirit realm and explain what is happening in and to you as you journey. 

That which was invisible created that which is visible...so that which is invisible...could be seen ~!

My earnest interest is in Revelation knowledge of the Kingdom of God by the spirit. 

The Heart of Abraham was one who heard by the spirit....The same applies to Isaac and Jacob. Paul....Look what he came out with by the spirit with no new testament~!
Jesus said ""You search the scriptures because in them you think you find everlasting life...but it is they that bear witness of me""....

But can you hear his voice by the spirit? Yes and he then is the only one who will reveal what is behind the written book...

This knowledge.....this is truth and is my life~! It is who....I AM ~!

Attraction is not a choice....and...""50"" is the new puberty~!

Many of my friends are in their 20's, so if you're young we can still kick it, because I'm not some creep, I'm just older. I play guitar and produce music. I haven't subscribed to the whole ""act your age"" thing. Music scene and performing keep me young. I play metal and progressive rock so if you are into metal and or good classic rock that would be awesome! Concerts!

Anyways, I like to kick it with white girls. I like to go to live music shows, and sometimes just want a nice white woman to accompany me. This is platonic, but who knows, maybe more if chemistry is right. FWB? Maybe just good friends, either way I respect boundaries, and I keep it real. I'm not some hard up lamer. That's why I posted here in the platonic section. But if we are attracted to each other there's nothing wrong with that. I'm open for romance also, haha, yeah right, like that's going to happen at my age! :(

I like fair skin and smart conversation. You are an open minded woman who isn't hung up on race, or the role that your peers expect you to fulfill. You like attention, and draw peoples eyes when you go out. You have cool style and are clean person. You like to drink and have an occasional smoke. You have your life together and get bored sometimes when there's no one around. Hit me up! If you are really light skinned redhead I will flip out, I love redhead girls!

Send me an email telling me about yourself and your interests and style. I am genuinely interested in you, and like to make eye contact when we talk. 

Let's go see some live music or hit a movie or art exhibit or grab some food. I especially like the beach at night. We can even grab some beers and hang out at my place which is nice and has amazing views of the city! I'll play you some guitar. If you sing thats awesome.

Looking forward to hearing from you!!

It's cool, you aren't alone! I got you ; )

I am female, kinda quirky, and sometimes in need of outside attention. So, I joined this group, and now we are looking for MARRIED ladies and gents to add to the conversation. It's a new group, Our chats range from our everyday stuff to fun, flirty and at times, sexual aka ""not clean"" . I mean, what the heck is clean chat anyway?? This is Kik!! Kill some time, make a friend?

Though we need ladies, both genders are welcome. It would be nice to have an avenue where we can discuss anything without the feeling of being judged, Whether you're happily married or not. This group is Looking forward to hearing from you :)

Because finding a good friend is like finding fuckin Nemo!

I've found myself with a lot more time on my hands at the moment. And making friends is hard. So I'm just trying to see if it's any easier here. Im looking for a friend that'll last longer than a few introductory emails. Just someone to add a little more animation to my life. Someone with a little wit and a sense of humor. 

I just want to talk to someone who isn't my snooty dog. I'm NOT talking the kind of ""talk"" that subliminally means lets hook up. Don't ask for a boob pic or send me a dick pic because I will block you so hard you'll fall on your face. 

That being said I am married, happily. You can be single or married or attached, doesn't matter. I'm not looking for any drama, so PLEASE be up front with me. 

A little about me. I like to have a nickname for everything, I feel likes it's my own inside joke! No it's not sad, it's refreshingly cute! I eat chocolate anything for breakfast. I think I overuse exclamation points. I like staying in on the weekends because I hate fighting crowds. I am currently binge watching Doctor Who (again)! But I haven't started on Capaldi, so no spoilers. Or I'll River Song ur ass back to Demons Run! And if you get all that PLEASE msg me! We must talk. If you don't get it it's okay too; I have a lot of other things to talk about.

I hate superficial people, so if your sexy and you know it I don't care. Hate roller coasters and lizards, they can just not exist! I'm a pretty loving person, so there isn't much stuff I don't like. Other than onions, and alarm clocks, empty toilet paper rolls, dirty feet in bed, coconuts, sweaty nights, kids, kids screaming, dirty kids...etc etc. but other than that! HAHA! 

If I haven't already bored you to sleep I must have written something that interests you! Please msg me because I'd like to know what it is. And I hope we can chat a little more!

Hi, 
I've been dealing with a LOT of stress going on in my life for a long time now. I feel like I'm at my breaking point right now and needing others to talk to. I have no friends and family (sibling, parent, ect) to lean on. People need others to lean on and to confide in. I didn't make this AD to bother anyone with my issues happening. I'm just stating a reason why friendship is important in my life and why talking to you is important/crucial to me. Even if we talk about anything, it's taking me away mentally and emotionally from the issues happening in my life. Friendship in my life means a lot to me. More so than many... I have a lot to give to others as a friend. I'm a very caring, kind, giving, loyal, and genuine person. I genuinely do care for other people. It's just how I am. Please know that this AD is for Platonic ONLY! Many people going on the Strictly Platonic Section don't get what that is, and I don't get why. Please be LOCAL because I do want to meet and hang out at some point. It's the best way to connect with each other. 😊 Well, I do hope that you're having a good day!!! Take care.

This brings me to one of my wishes, which is to find a gym buddy who has a membership to LA fitness. Aside from that, we can engage in other activities depending on things such as mood, day, time, etc..
I am calm, confident, and open in nature. Typically I am a loner who enjoys taking myself out on dates and crafting spur of the moment adventures. Occasionally, it would be nice to hang out with a group of people or one on one.

I am trying to keep this ad as generic as possible. So, if there is anything else you want to inquire about please do. I will always have an honest answer.

Hey, I'm a friendly, courteous young professional with an unusual hobby. I like to let interested women kick me right in the balls as hard as they please. 

For me, it's the thrill of it. I only really enjoy it with strangers.

Why should you do it? It's fun, for one thing. Every woman knows how fun it is to see a guy get kicked in the nuts, but would you believe how many grown adult women never had the chance? Now's your chance!

For another thing, it's incredibly empowering. I'll stand with my hands behind my back and my legs spread nice and wide. You can take your time, aim, and then smash my nuts as hard as you like with your favorite shoes. 

Yes, it'll hurt me a lot. No, there's no danger of harming them long term. It's just for fun. The fun doesn't go any further than kicking me in the nuts, so don't worry - except - every woman gets to kick them again if she doesn't feel that once was satisfying enough.

Just like the title says. I'm a 40s guy and looking for e mail friendship with a younger girl to add a little spice to life. Now I'm talking over 18 ok preferably over 20.This can be only an online friendship if you wish and if that makes it easier for you to open up. This would be a good way for you to find out what guys think and want. So if you've ever had a crush on a friends dad or the boss at work or a teacher here's your chance to say what you want and see what on older guy thinks. Say hi if this piques your interest.

Here's where I really need your opinion. I told her I didn't think it's a question that should be asked in either direction. We didn't argue but she was of the opinion that's it's a fair question that shes been asked. I told her I've never been asked that. I woke up this morning to a text saying ""I don't think this is going to work out"" . I'm not mad or upset it's just odd to me. Am I wrong thinking that it's a question you don't ask?

Hay there. Are you a professional/seasoned writer with a book you want to publish? Or maybe you are launching an independent publishing company on your own? Or perhaps you are a published writer who is tired of giving the lion's share of profits to your conventional publisher and you yearn to break free and start keeping your own profits since you're doing all the work anyway. Or you might have already tried self publishing and want to do it again but this time not totally alone. 

Do you long for a comrad you can go to for emotional support, feedback and friendship, who is going through the same thing with their own book? Someone you can plan marketing strategies with? Share contacts and experience, bounce wuery letters etc off? Essentially walk the path with? Who doesn't want to charge you? 

If so, we have something in common and might benefit from knowing/helping one another. I am a professional screenwriter who is on the verge of self publishing my first novel and though I have read dozens of books, articles and blogs on the what, when, where, if, how, and whys of indy publishing, it's like a big confusing blob of information at this point, and I would really like to have one comitted, serious, humble, friend with a sense of humor, in the trenches, who I could help navigate and vice versa, the choppy seas of first time self publishing. Someone who will keep me accountable but will also hold my hand when necessary. I am looking for someone who is driven, believes in themselves and their product, imagines that they could easily become a self made millionaire (I know it's rare but you know your book is amazing and needed in the world) from it, who has a strong work ethic, will not give up and flake out and has done their work. I am looking for someone in the final editing stage who will be ready to go to print by fall---just so we are on the same time table. If this sounds like you I hope you will respond. I am not looking for someone to assist me for pay, and I'm not looking for a pipe dreamer who someday wants to write a book or publish. I am calling in someone who is doing it. Please don't write me unless your are serious and this ad reads like an answer to your prayers. If you write me, be prepared to talk on the phone within 48 hours and meet soon after. Please tell me about yourself, your age, your gender, your interests, about your publishing experience, past writing you have done, any applicable jobs or experience in related fields, about your book, the title and what you have done so far on the road to publishing it. If I think we could vibe I'll respond by answering all the same questions.

Anyway, I can't take serious relationships anymore, they're too painful and confusing haha, but there were certain aspects of dating I like, so I guess I'm just looking for something a little lower stakes, less serious right now. I guess what I'm trying to say is, let's trade pics, get to know eachother, maybe meet up, and if all goes well let's hang out and give eachother orgasms sometimes. I've been told I'm quite poetic.

A few years back, I had a friend who did one thing I really miss. Perhaps you have a similar desire. Sometimes he would have me stand in front of him and gently massage my lower back. Then gradually he would unloosen my belt and the first layer of clothing would be history, so that I could either rest over his lap or have me lie on the bed whichever felt good to me. He would proceed to give me a gentle butt massage over my briefs which felt so soothing. Eventually when he sensed I felt at ease, he would gradually lower the briefs and continue to massage this natural cheek area slowly and lovingly. I miss that, and later he invited me to do the same with him. What intimacy and sense of connection with another man! My white butt looks actually quite nice, as I hope your cute white butt would be as well. I'm wondering if there might be a guy willing to do the same, and we could enjoy some pleasant moments together helping one another to feel good and relaxed. Absolutely no sex involved as I only want to enjoy this beautiful area of the body with peace of mind. It would be a memorable experience which only the two men can share when there is mutual interest. Middle aged here.

Seeking a 24 Hour Fitness Workout Partner 

I am a female member of 24HourFitness. I live in the WLA/SM area and usually use the Santa Monica facility to workout.

For some time, I danced professionally (musical theater, etc) but lost the desire to travel as a performer. Along with that went my regular fitness schedule = REHEARSAL.
I'm still somewhat ""in shape"" but NOT how I'd like and what I'm used to seeing in the mirror. 
You know how critical us women can be...
I believe that working out with someone that knows what equipment to use to and HOW to use it properly would help me tremendously and I would actually ENJOY going to the gym regularly and also make a new friend that is serious about fitness as well. 

I'm usually available M-F as early as 3:30pm - 4:00pm 

Thanks a bunch and have an awesome day! :-)

Pablo Picasso once said: ""Art washes away from our souls the dust of everyday life."" 

Man, can I ever relate to that! I can't possibly say how many times a certain song, or book, or film, or painting has rocked my world and catapulted my limited perspective into another stratosphere.

As an artist, I draw inspiration from out of the wild blue in the most random possible ways. I assume others browse Craig's List Personals essentially to seek inspiration from perfect strangers. 

Today, I woke up inspired to reach out to other denizens of the City of Angels who share my passion for the arts. Feel free to contact me if any of the following apply: 

1. You wish to swap creative ideas with a fellow artist via email, telephone, or over coffee. 
2. You have always been passionate about the arts and curious to connect with a local artist. 
3. You wish to submit photos, or pose as a photo model for a potential painting.
4. You would like to escape the tame beige world to enjoy a more wildly colorful life.
5. Hell, you may have creative reasons to connect that this artist failed to think of.

The attached is a pic of me taken about a year ago, by a random stranger from another country, who happened to pass by while I was painting a mural on a busy boulevard in Venice California.

I'm an ex-athlete looking for a new fitness trainer. You must understand nutrition, strength training and listening to your client's needs.

I've been back in LA over a year now and I've got a demanding job, so my stress level is more elevated and I sit a lot more than usual - so I'm battling belly fat that I've never had. 

I need help with nutrition (what to eat, when - and what not to eat, when) and more frequent, heart-rate targeted cardio. I also want to tighten things back up a bit.

I'm still fit - 42, 5'10 and currently 167 (and good looking for all you shallow types, ha). Healthy lifestyle and pretty laid back, love to laugh and smile. I don't generally complain during workouts, will follow the advice given and prefer if you have a sense of humor. 

I work in Burbank but live in the West Hollywood area, so please be fairly local. 

I just joined Equinox Hollywood (opening this Fall) but I'm open to a temporary membership someplace for the next several months to get my body back in shape. I currently workout in my office building, but it's limited. 

I've had successful trainers in the past and I know how my body works. That said, I'm not afraid of hard work (or commitment) and always willing to let a new trainer show me something new.

Please get back to me with more than a phone number (a website, info, list of questions, etc). I need to know we are a good fit - hope you understand, and look forward to hearing from you!

Hello Ladies! :)

Well my story goes a little something like this...

I'm looking to make new friends, hopefully someone I can get along with really well and grow a nice friendship with. I have a few close girl friends but now they're all either married or with kids. I'm 24, Hispanic and live in the valley. I love to go out, bars, try new restaurants, go hiking, movies, gym, anything outdoors, music festivals and of course Disneyland :) I'm an animal lover so I'd love to meet someone with similar interests. I'm single, no kids, one dog. I work and I'm in the process of going back to school to get my bachelors. I'd like to meet a girl who's down to earth, similar interests and who's ambitious. I hate envy between friends and it would be nice to have someone that can motivate me and vice versa. I am straight and I'm looking for friendships ONLY, nothing more. I'm not looking to settle down at the moment, I'm trying to achieve bigger better things in life before thinking of settling down or having kids, but of course I want to enjoy my youth and id like a new friend to make fun new memories with. 

I am a little worried about getting replies from wierdos/fakes so if you're interested please send me your Instagram username so I can see you're real and I'll send you mine in return. Also please put ""New friends new adventures"" on your subject line to make sure it's not spam. 

Thanks :)

m4w body : fit height : 5'11"" (180cm) status : widowed : Non-smoker, light drinker

age: 79
Let me try this again. When I ran a similar ad recently I got answers from women in their 40s and 50s who thought I was looking for a mistress. I am not.

I am an old man, in good shape, hwp. I have been widowed for many years after a long marriage. I am not seeking love much less a wife or live-in companion (or mistress). What I am seeking is a sensual, friendly relationship with an age-appropriate woman. I crave physical contact - hugs, strokes, cuddling. This is not the same as looking for sex. Whether it goes in that direction would only be by mutual choice and after some time.

The essence of the relationship I seek is a mutual desire for warm, comforting physical contact. Whether we find other interests in common, like music, movies, art, books, hiking, would remain to be seen. We might be very compatible physically and have nothing else in common. Or maybe we would. In any event, I am not offering or at this point in my life emotionally capable of being in a marriage-like arrangement so if that is your long-term goal I am not your man.

You should be at least 60 years old. Please do not answer this ad if you are younger! There is no upper age limit as long as you are in touch with your physical desire for human contact. I have no restrictions as to your race or ethnicity. (I am white.) Within limits, I have no preferences as to your physical type. (I would draw the line at what is called SSBBW in CraigsList-ese.) The women who have been important in my life have ranged from skinny to Rubenesque; their shape has not been one of the most important things about any of them.

I live alone in downtown LA. I can host or travel. We could arrange a first meeting someplace public for coffee or a drink. I would like this to happen soon. Since I am retired I am free much of the time.

If you reply please put CONTACT as the subject to weed out CL spam and scams. If you reply I will respond with my name, photos, and phone / text #

Hey, ladies.

Am I the only one asking why it's so hard to make friends in LA??

I don't get it. With 7 or so BILLION people in the world, WHY is this such a difficult task?!

Well, here's a bit about me:

I'm 23. I live in NoHo.

I'm a chill girl. I like to adventure. I love to dance. 
I live to have spontaneous outings in order to explore this gigantic city with an open mind. 
I love nature. I love hiking. I love exploring random art galleries around the city.
I love art. I love to draw while listening to music in the grass. 
I love exploring psychic/crystal shops around Los Angeles. 
I love anything and everything that gives me a tasty culture shock.
I LOVE watching movies. I love food. I love drinking.
I love going to random venues in Silver Lake to check out EDM shows with DJs I've never even heard of... why? Because why the hell not?
I like to RAVE(!!!). I like to party. I love anything and everything spontaneous.
Let's go to festivals together! Let's go to raves together! 
I love animals. Nature. EDM. Alternative music. 

Now let's get a little more personal.

I'm an actress. I'm an artist. I'm an atheist. I'm eclectic and artsy. 
I hate shit-talking and bias.
I am loving an accepting. I LIVE to connect with other lovely females.
I LOVE LOVE.
I am a university graduate with a heart of gold.
I'm a smart chick and a hard-core cuddler.
I'm accepting and loving and really good friend material! I promise!

Wanna be friends?

TELL ME ALL ABOUT YOURSELF. EVERYTHING!
But PLEASE, shoot me your Facebook and Instagram! Let me cyber stalk you!
Hell, send selfies if you want.

LET'S BE FRIENDS GOD DAMMIT.

(I HAVE posted this in the rooms shared section as well, but just in case wanted to try it here; even if it brought me a new friend for my arrival, that would still be MORE than worth it.)

Yeah, I know: in Los Angeles, known for anything BUT kind hearts?

My situation is a bit unique, so wanted to make sure I explained it right to be upfront/honest from jump. I am a gay white male, a freelance writer (yes, published) wishing desperately to get back to the Los Angeles and pick up with pursuing writing again where I left off. I was in Seattle when, about a year ago, allowed myself to be talked into relocating to Phoenix by a ""friend"" who lived in nearby Scottsdale who, soon after I arrived, turned out to be anything but a friend (one of those people who, when in a relationship with someone controlling, forgets they even have friends). I truly hate it here, on top of which am in a roommate situation that's escalated to such a disaster I am moving out next week.

Problem is, I've been able to save no money to move WITH. But as I am so close, need to relocate, AND can get back at the same job I had in Koreatown when I left Los Angeles a couple years ago, I was hoping this was my shot.

So the reason I write this ...

What I am seeking is someone who might be able to help someone until he gets righted again, willing to let me start paying rent once the checks are coming in, or maybe has some personal assistant, writing, or other work I can do for them to defray costs the first month. As a writer, I can edit, help someone with their manuscript, do online research - and with a work background in administrative, call center and customer service work, with a HUGE emphasis on the phones, I have proven in the past to be very valuable in pretty much anything along these lines. Once up and running fully, was looking for a place for maybe $500-$600/month, all bills paid if possible and with something by way of furniture only because I won't be exactly bringing any. Easy access to Ktown would be a miracle, work-wise. In return, you get a roommate that doesn't smoke, is completely anti-drugs (including weed, it makes me sick to even smell it), doesn't think enough of alcohol to normally even keep it in the house, and TOTALLY respects someone else's space, place and things ... hoping for the same (though I haven't always gotten it, certainly not where I am now). I clean up after myself, do dishes soon as I've finished eating (sometimes even after I've cooked, before eating), and really believe that if everyone picks up after themselves then very little maintenance is needed, anyway. I'm a film buff, reader, and write blogs of both film and book reviews, and while I believe roommates don't have to exactly be friends, I believe they should be friendLY; be able to say hello, how was your day, maybe even sit down to an occasional meal together. Definitely a believer in open communication; how are any bumps in the road resolved, otherwise, really? Silence only makes things fester.

I know I have no right to think anyone in hardcore, hard-hearted L.A. would be open enough to respond to this - but as my mom, who passed away in 1999, impressed on me growing up: you never know until you try. Am in a bit of a desperate situation, and if you've not got a lot to lose anyway, why not go for your dream?

Hey there, 

I recently moved back to the area after spending a year in Portland and another year in Las Vegas. Looking for someone with similar interests to hang out with.

I'm interested in art, geocaching, indie music, photography, film (independent/foreign/animated), making things, cooking (mostly vegetarian), books (memoirs, short stories, fiction, graphic novels), road trips, brunch, anthropology, traveling, concerts, bowling, bingo, zines, thrift shops, etc. 

I'm not into smoking, drinking, or drugs, but don't mind if you participate.
I'm gay so please don't be close-minded, I'm just looking for new friends. 

Feel free to send some info about yourself and let me know if you have Instagram.

I'm an amateur photographer with minimal experience, and I am hoping to find someone willing to let me practice on them. If you're looking for a new facebook profile picture, senior portraits, or have a fashion blog that needs updating, or anything really, tell me the details. If it's within the San Fernando Valley, or anywhere along the Metro Redline, I can get myself there. Otherwise we'll have to make some arrangements. But if you need anything more complicated than a few lenses and a manual flash can handle, you'll probably want someone else. I'm not a pro by any means, but with your help I'm hoping to get there. Thanks.

Ok this will be a weird one for you gentle readers in CL-land, however, I did this back home in Chicago and have a lifelong friend from it.

Just so we are clear -- you garden, I do not. All of this will be clear as you read what I have to say.

My husband and I recently rented a charming home in the hills of Bel Air, think 16th Century cottage. With a decent sized area for a garden and hiking trails behind (as in fallow land) that is super easy to access. I would LOVE to garden and have visions of nummy home grown vegetables and fruits gracing my life. However, I am a notorious plant killer, I am serious, notorious. I once killed a bamboo garden, yes, the weed, bamboo, just by taking possession of a home. There was a crazy happy garden and then death, all within a week, I changed nothing not even the gardener, all I did was talk to the bamboo, I even said very sweet nice things. I have been killing plants since I was born, I have system tested every variant and every variable, the issue is me. We have tried gardening classes and friends have tried to help, it is no use. My husband has a to-do list that far exceeds his capacity to tend a garden, heck he bought loads of vegetables 3 weeks ago and has not had the time to even consider getting them into the ground. 

Why not get a gardener? Because fruits and vegetables and the like need love, they need someone who knows to talk to the tree fairies and the vegetable trolls and that can only really be given from someone who has a vested personal interest in those little green lives. 

My friendship, is clearly not a great trade for this work, LOL though it would be great if we become friends. So what am I offering? Beyond an unlimited supply of chicken poop, which I do not value but I am told is of value to gardening people . . . a gentle sweet gardening spot in a crazy city, a cut of whatever we harvest -- in some cases my husband wants to plant things we would never eat and wasting that food would make me sad (zucchini, squash, stuff like that). He is a bit of a prepper. So, if you have the prepper gene, I offer a refuge with some built in food if things get rough. A tranquil place to come and read or paint or whatever when you need some outdoor space. I will gladly buy the trees, plants, and seeds and necessary support items, we have auto watering, I will not touch/look at/speak with the plants though I can harvest without death ensuing. And since my death touch does not extend to fungus, as I get my mushroom garden up, I am also happy to share, my husband doesn't do morels but if there is interest I would be willing to add those as well. Oh and for digging and flattening land I will offer up my husband and his digging dog to help, smile. My husband and I are both great cooks and we are happy to feed you when you are here as well. And I am a start-up specialist so if you are wishing to start your own business I am always willing to give advice from my battle scarred playbook.

Some added data:

1) You should probably like large dogs, I have large pups and while I do NOT want them in the gardens, they are a part of my home life.

2) Yes, I have chickens, they are not producing and while I could share some eggs, and probably will if we ever get them popping out, my dogs eat raw and the hens were bought for my pups first and all us humans second. While I have threatened to feed the chickens to the dogs if I continue to have a negative ROI on them, the truth is I will rehome the lazy chickens if they are still not producing by the late spring. 

3) I work from home. 

4) While I am one who really does think fairies and trolls probably have a hand in the life and happiness of the plants, I am not an airy fairy LA girl, I am a pretty hard core Libertarian who grew up very Midwestern, with Midwestern values and goals, with New Age parents. While I tolerate 'liberal' chatter outside of my home, when we enter my Zen sanctuary, I only really let people in who share my core values. Not to say you need to vote Republican, I am about as socially liberal as it gets. It's that my values are that we are each responsible for our own well-being and should not be whiney and begging the government to wipe our butts while they take basic human rights away from us. I have very close friends who are literally European Communists, the difference is their opinion is educated and worthy of intelligent argument, where as local liberalism sounds a lot more like waaaah waaaaah waaaah. The garden is there partially for happy cooking goodness and partially to sustain us when pandemonium takes place outside, it is consistent with my values. I don't have time or ability to garden, so I am willing to trade with someone who wants to garden for items they might value. 

5) Wildlife, wildlife is an issue. We have deer, wildcats, and coyotes around and about. The chickens are safe, and I may place a dog kennel outside to further scare off the larger bullies in the neighborhood. I have heard either rats or mice as well but the dogs are great mousers and we have owls so I believe there is no reason (yet) to do anything than let nature take its course. 

6) We have too much shade but we are happy to cut back or hire people to cut back the trees.

7) I have nearly zero storage space so we need to balance the needs of the garden with where we store those garden necessities.

8) No men, I work from home, my husband does not and while I like men as friends and humans, I don't want the added stress and worry while I am busy on conference calls and the like. 

9) We are not 420 friendly. That is to say, in my bestest Libertarian voice, I don't give a damn what you ingest, smoke or lubricate your skin with and I don't care what you might do if you go for a hike, however, we will not be breaking federal laws in my home. 

10) I am a little bit crazy. We, well me really, pondered the purchase of an outdoor cat (I am badly 
allergic) and a goat. Both for utilitarian purposes and not because of a whim, we chose against both because of the bullies that also live on the hill with us and hunt by night.

If this insane post has peaked your interest, it would be delightful to chat!

Can Anybody find Me 
*Sigh* 
So I've done this before and it just didn't workout because people are so temporary now a days . I will try again hopefully I'll find a Bestfriend. I'm 22yrs old AA Virgo lesbian partnered from LA living in Atlanta 5'3 curvy I love to sing like a lot lol I'm really blunt and really bubbly I'm pretty friendly I work full time have my own (car , apartment, etc. as if that matters) I love all kinds of things mini golf , movies , shopping , mani pedi, laser tag , paint ball , arcades lol , etc I'm not just strict to girly stuff although I am fem . I'm looking for a Bestfriend that's like the best of the best My 24/7 My ROD Like super close. Bestfriend dates Texting all the time (find time for eachother) hang out or travel to visit Bestfriend sleep overs (no crazy shit though lol . Be honest loyal trustworthy 
fun social Gay men welcomed 
Preferred : AA Gay men ; Studs ; Fems ; No labels etc. LESBIAN/ Gay but bisexual is ok too. FaceTime / Video Chat / SnapChat Texting Phone calls are a MUST 
I'm not for the temporary term shits too dumb and a waste of both our times being honest so if you respond to this be a permanent fixture. 

Respond with Instagram name and age. 
If you know you fit the description send IG & number 

*No Men*
Nothing sexual 😁 
No Ratchets

I'm a 32 yo f single no kids or pets and really just need a quick shower and somewhere to sleep for a few hours. I'm friendly and very trustworthy. All I want is to clean up and sleep somewhere in don't have to worry about my safety. Any time of the day or night would be helpful! I don't drive so of course I'd prefer it be somewhere close to me. I'm in La mirada near la mirada Blvd and imperial hwy. Thank you for reading.
