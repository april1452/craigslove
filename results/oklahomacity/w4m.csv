I've been waiting for my Prince Charming to come riding in on a white horse. When he didn't show I thought he was lost riding a slow turtle. Now I've came to the conclusion he's been hit by a bus.
' 
I'm bright, a bit impetuous, sophisticated if needed and amusing with my own personal sparkle. 

Since Prince Charming is no where to be found the next best thing would be a dashing gentlemen that's courageous, perceptive, creative and venturesome. But above all, must love to laugh!

I seek a white man in my age range. Please between 40 to 55. If these particular qualities identifies you, I'd enjoy hearing from you.

Please respond with a little something about yourself and a G-rated picture would be wonderful.

If your married or attached I'm not interested. If your out of state or the country I'm not interested.

I am a woman who has become curious as to why men act the way they do. I mean women are just as messed up but men say they are looking for something specific and when someone better than they expected reaches out to them; they don't even have the decency to respond with a ""No thanks"". Has everyone lost their manners? 

Anyway I'm looking for a decent looking guy who is tall, decent body, and honest, respectful, loving, caring and wants a friend to start out with. I like many different things because I am a unique woman. I love watching most sports, movies, live bands, and going to have fun dancing. I also enjoy quiet time reading, watching movies, and just chilling out. 

Hopefully this will get to an honest person. Please reply by changing the title to your favorite singer or band and include a picture or probably won't get a response.

Non-smoker, single white female looking for the same. I would prefer someone who is 47 - 60, happy with their life and career and someone looking for a friend first with the hope that it would turn into a long term relationship.

It's that time of year where I would love nothing more than to be wrapped up in the arms of a wonderful man.

I'm a good, honest woman who likes to pamper my man. I grew up a country girl and even though I live in the city now, it's only because my career brought me here. But now I'm in the position where I can do my work from anywhere with a high speed data connection, so I want to get back to my country roots. 
I want to settle down with a man who is living alone, no kids at home. Grown kids are ok but just not living at home. I want my man to appreciate a woman who pampers him. I like to keep a nice house, cook and sit on your lap and hug and kiss you when you get home. I want a man who knows what it means trust and talk about everything. 
I am 54, successful professional. Considered pretty by most men. Been told recently that I'm very sensuous. I feel sensuous. I'm very busty, not a thin girl, but also not BBW, I'm curvy, great legs. 
I'm a Tom Boy outdoors, love farm animals, 4 wheeling and working the garden...and I'm ""all woman"" indoors. 
I'm attracted to taller men (over 5'10""), strong to stocky built, ruggedly good looking (but attraction has so many levels). I like a relatively clean cut guy, goatees are nice...just not into the ""Billy Bob"" types. And he MUST be a country man.

Hey there!

I miss having a connection with someone.. I miss cuddling, making out, someone playing with my hair, and just having someone being there for me. I wanna be there for someone as well. I like to text/talk a lot.. I wanna find someone who is at least 22 and under 40.. I don't really mind what you look like.. your personality is what matters to me. I don't have children.

I'm not just looking for sex. I want to build a relationship with someone. I have a car, a job, and I am a student. 

I'll send pic once I receive yours.. I can't put one on my ad because of my job.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Since Prince Charming is no where to be found the next best thing would be a dashing gentlemen that's courageous, perceptive, creative and venturesome. But above all, must love to laugh!

I seek a white man in my age range. Please between 45 to 55. If these particular qualities identifies you, I'd enjoy hearing from you.

I am looking for a gentleman between the age of 35 - 50 for a long term relationship without the commitment or strings attached. One guy that wants to get together for dinner, dancing or just drive around and talk. Whatever we feel like doing. Someone who can make me have butterflies and weak knees; who can make me melt with your kisses and make me wet by touching me. Someone who not only enjoys physical sex but enjoys giving as well as receiving oral sex. I'm not looking to jump from bed to bed. I'm just looking for that one special guy that needs some attention as much as I do. Whether you are married or single it will be discrete. 
I am around 5-6, slender, brunette and brown eyed. I have been told that I'm very pretty and have a sexy body. I am drug and disease free and you must be too. I do occasionally drink and do not have any objections to you drinking in moderation. 
If you are still reading this and would like to know more please respond with a couple of recent profile pics including your face. If you don't take the time to send pictures then I won't take the time to respond. Let's see if we can find a mutually satisfying arrangement. Please put your favorite color in the subject line.

If you're sensitive or quick to call someone a foul name simply because they're honest & give their opinion, leave this now. 

I am a young single mother, I do work, & have a place to live. I would like to start dating, but mind you.....I'm the world's worst at it. If you have zero patience then this is not for you. I do not wish to pursue any nonsense, my view on dating is to eventually find someone to marry, I do understand I may not find that here....but its worth a shot right? I do not wish to have someone only interested in sex so please refrain from bringing it up right away. I am not the prettiest or stylish female out there, so don't expect flawless. I'm also not super in shape either but not fat by any means, but if you work out cool....I'm slowly getting into gym life. 
Type I'm interested in- 
Decent looking
Funny
Professional (don't be childish or a clown on a regular basis)
Hard working (have goals morals & a stable job) *I don't mind struggling with someone, but I will not struggle more because of someone
Respectable
Genuine
Please do not have unnecessary drama or crazy ex's, I have no time for that and if I feel I have to run a background check on you.....it best come up clean.
If you're controlling or feel you can change someone to fit what you want, just don't even bother with this post cause I'm not that person.
If you feel you your my type email me and maybe we can get to know each other.

Do you know that feeling you get when you can't wait to get home to see her? You can't keep your hands or eyes off her? You find yourself sending absolutely mushy surprise texts just to let her know that you are thinking about her? The proud feeling that she's all yours? And it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks? You'll kiss or touch her in front of anyone and everyone. The intense feeling when you actually make love to her. The same intensity when she just touches you outside of the bedroom. The feeling of knowing that she does everything for you too? You want for nothing because you have it all. She's not Barbie but she's your queen. She's funny, doesn't want for much, and loves to do men things more than women stuff. Your best friend. 
I had all of this once but lost it. I want something like this again. I'm not looking for a hook up, or to be involved with a married man, I don't drink, or do drugs. I'm pushing 50 so please be close(very close) to my age. I won't consider any young bucks or black guys(just my preference). I don't judge a book from its cover but there has to be chemistry. Happy fishing!

Hi, as my posting title suggests I'm a single mother looking for a single dad.

I have two boys and have been divorced for a year now.

I clearly have never written one of these before or it would hopefully be a bit smoother to read but I 
digress. 

I'm searching for someone to date and hopefully it turns into something serious.

I'm looking for someone that can keep up with me intellectually and can make me laugh.

I've been waiting for my Prince Charming to come riding in on a white horse. When he didn't show I thought he was lost riding a slow turtle. Now I've came to the conclusion he's been hit by a bus.

I'm bright, a bit impetuous, sophisticated if needed and amusing with my own personal sparkle. 

Since Prince Charming is no where to be found the next best thing would be a dashing gentlemen that's courageous, perceptive, creative and venturesome. But above all, must love to laugh!

I seek a white man in my age range. Please between 45 to 55. If these particular qualities identifies you, I'd enjoy hearing from you.

Please respond with a little something about yourself and a G-rated picture would be wonderful.

If your married or attached I'm not interested. If your out of state or the country I'm not interested

I have posted on here before but obviously with no luck so I am trying again. I am a single mom of 2 boys who are my world. If that bothers you good luck on your search but no point in reading any further. I am Caucasian and I am full figured. I understand not everybody is attracted to that. If that is the case good luck but please don't send me an email telling me how nasty I am I don't care what you think. I am happy with who I am and I am working on making myself better. I lost 60 lbs last year and hope to lose several more this year. I am 29 and have blonde hair and hazel eyes and I am 5'3"". I am also currently living at home because I am working on finishing my degree and didn't want my kids to lose out on time with me.

If you are still reading, awesome let's see if you finish reading.

I am looking for a man between the ages of 28 and 39. Due to past experiences I only date white or latino men. Yes I know not all black men are the same but I wouldn't be able to get over the fear so please understand it is nothing personal against you.

Still reading? Sweet!!!

I am not looking for hook ups, no strings attached, or friends with benefits. I want something real and long lasting. The best relationships are built on a solid friendship. I want that friendship with a man who can become my best friend, better half, partner in crime, and eventually someday my husband. I like my man taller than me and I am fairly short so that is pretty open. I also like husky, stocky, built, and average men. Facial hair is fine with me or not each man is different. I am fine with tattoos also. I don't have any because of my needle phobia but maybe someday. Also I don't mind if you smoke, I am a smoker as well.

Now here is where I may lose most of you.

I do not do drugs at all. I will not be with anyone who does anything other than weed. However, don't do it around me and don't be high when I am around. Also you will not meet my kids for a long time. I am very protective of them and don't want them getting attached to someone who hasn't proven he plans to be around for the long haul. If you are still reading, there is a good chance I would love to talk to you. The most important thing to me is honesty. I won't lie to you or hide anything from you so don't do it to me. 

I want a man who is first and for most honest, but I also want a man who is SINGLE, loyal, affectionate, trustworthy, confident, intelligent, funny as hell, down to earth, family oriented, compassionate, understanding, accepting, open to communication, level headed, faithful, and himself. Please don't try to be someone you aren't, that doesn't impress me. I will accept you for you as I hope you accept me for me. I do have pictures however because of haters I don't post them on here but would be happy to send one in return after receiving one from you. If you finished reading just to see what all I would say but you aren't interested, thank you for reading I wish you all the best of luck. For those who are interested, shoot me an email with your favorite season in the subject so I can weed out bots and spam. I look forward to talking to you soon. Good luck to everyone on your personal search for whatever you may be looking for.

I perfer white men, somewhere between the ages of 45 to 55. Non smoker would be great and a social drinker that loves to cuddle, watch movies, try new restaurants, go to the local hang outs listen to live music.

Be brave, we could make a great connection.

Just a little rant to see if I'm wrong or right. I'm in a relationship (almost 2 yrs.) with a older retired gentleman close to my age. When were together we have a incredible time and do a lot of fun things. We take frequent trips, run errands, dinners, shows, intriguing conversation or just a simple walk around the neighborhood. Both of us are in good physical shape. We are sexually active, ...sounds great doesn't it. Neither of us want to remarry, he's divorced and I'm a widow. (4 yrs) 

Okay now for my problem...I've always been available and put him as my priority, no matter what I have going on or need to do, he comes first. If he decides that he has anything else to do and I mean anything, I'm not a priority, his needs are. Our relationship is strictly at his whim. We do see each other 2-3 times a week, he would prefer to see me 3-4 times a month, but I would like to see him more. I'm not welcomed to just drop by without his specific invitation, and not a minute earlier than the time he specified. I do love him and have told him so, but he is unable to express his feelings for me. He's always very loving and very giving when we're together, but I feel that something is lacking. I was not my late husbands priority, we were married over 40 yrs and I would like have that feeling from a man that he can't wait to see me again and goes out of his way to make that happen. He doesn't seem to miss me when we're apart and looks forward to our separations. 

Am I wrong to want more?

I enjoy cooking and trying new things in the kitchen. Also, enjoy sitting by the fire pit with a glass of wine talking or cuddling up on the sofa watching a movie.

Would like to find someone who has their priorities in order and knows what they want out of life. Must be employed, own transportation and non-drug user. Someone with a great sense of humor and knows how to have a good time. NO NEGATIVE men needed. Most important someone who is family oriented.

If interested please feel free to contact me and send a photo. NO pic, NO reply!

Hi,

I am currently just seeking a nice Christian gentleman to get to know and see what happens. I moved to this area to start over fresh with my spouse , but we have moved on.

About me: I have two jobs at a major University here in Oklahoma, I will be leaving for the coast during the summer to teach a fitness class on the beach. I work out everyday. I am a devoted Christian with morals. I do not cheat, do drugs, drink or party. I enjoy hiking, camping, tennis, yoga, and traveling. I am humble, cute, smart and educated. I have good hygiene. I'm not in to sleeping around. I am not one who likes to get hit on by men in public, nor do I flirt with men. However, I enjoy flirting with my man in a relationship or marriage. I love to kiss and get close to you. I love to make passionate love to a man in a marriage. My long term goal is to find a good guy. Whether your rich or middle class, doesn't matter, as long as your morals and values are where they should be.

You: Please be honest, good values and morals, good hygiene, a job, mentally stable and a Christian, not in to drugs bars, drinking, smoking, or cheats. Someone who works out for their health, not ego. Someone who enjoys hiking, camping, deep sea fishing, being outdoors, and long bike rides. Some one who respects themselves and others, some one who makes good choices. We all make mistakes, but mistakes that will affect others' isn't very nice and it's selfish, and you really shouldn't be looking for a relationship. Especially if you enjoy being a "" player"".

Not exactly sure what I'm looking for. early 30s gal, born and raised in Oklahoma. I'm a one of a kind, and no, I don't like tooting my own horn. I'm a healthy mixture of the funny girl, the social butterfly, a classic/classy chick, the nerdy book-worm, with a little bit of a rebellious streak, but nothing to crazy. I'm outgoing, love to laugh, love traveling, meeting new people, and having endless conversations about nothing and everything all at once. My best qualities are my sense of humor, my big heart and my intelligence. I value those things about myself, and value them in other people. I love movies, music, books, concerts, and lots of other randomness. I've had a pretty long run of bad luck with relationships, but I'm open to whatever my happen here....I may be looking for love in all the wrong places, but for lack of a better option, here I am. 

I'm looking for someone who is intelligent, funny, romantic, passionate, sensitive, and affectionate...not necessarily in that order. :-) My life is far from perfect, and I don't expect perfection, but I'd like to find someone who at least somewhat has things together. Someone who can talk about anything with anyone. Tall, broad shoulders, beefy, beards and tattoos also help. :-) Just looking to start off with conversation and see where it goes from there. If nothing more than friendship comes of it, it's still be a good day. Between the ages of 25-43 please. Send me a pic aND I promise I'll send one back. Maybe I'm delusional, or old fashioned...bit I'd like to believe chivalry and romance are still alive. I want someone that makes me light up when they walk into a room...and who I miss as soon as they walk away. Someone who makes me feel like the only girl in the world, and who I can count on to always have my back. I want a best friend and someone who has arms that I can't wait to fall into at the end of.the day. I treat my man like a king, and I'll ride with you through the bull sh*t...as long as you don't bull sh*t me. 

There's this song, that I've been pretty stuck on lately. It's so beautiful, and pretty romantic...and makes me a little jealous. I want someone to feel this way about me :-). The notion is incredibly romantic, and makes my heart go pitter patter. 

Listen to it, and let me know what you think. Is there a song that defines romance to you? Let's talk about it! Msg me back with the name of your favorite song in the subject line so I know that you aren't spam. 





Listen to ""Nothing Really Matters"" By Mr. Probz. ""Unbroken Promise"" By Erick Baker is another one I'm stuck on. :-) hope to hear from you all soon.

First of let me say this I'm getting tired of men saying that I need to leave my mom but you have to understand she has been through a lot these past 4 years and not one of siblings have helped me out, So, I have been helping my mom all by myself and then when I got pregnant, I didn't know what I was going to do but somehow I've managed and my child has turned out alright without her father's help.I'm a single mom raisin my child on my own. I'm looking for a man who will accept me for me, won't hurt me or my child, cheat on me, and lie to me. I'd love to find a man who sends me loving good morning texts, texts me throughout the day, and sends loving good night texts.. I want to find someone who knows how to treat a woman and will treat me the way I should be treated. I just want to find love and be able to call him my hubby and maybe one day we get married and have kids. I want my daughter to have siblings and know that no matter what I do anything and everything for the people I love and care bout. I honestly don't care how old you as long as you are of legal age and not over 49. I will not date someone over 49 sorry. I'm tired of always thinking I found the right guy then I introduce him to my mom and daughter then he accuses me of using him for his money. I don't want your money I just want you treat me right, love me for me, be honest, trustworthy, doesn't lie or cheat, doesn't hurt me or my daughter. I'm just tired of all the men I dated saying they are different but turn out to be the same as my exes. I want to be able to enjoy sex instead of the man getting on top doing his business then finishes and gets off of me then rolls over and goes to sleep, why can't we do some foreplay and turn me on before we do it. I want to find someone I can talk to for hours bout anything and everything and he just listens to me. I like to find someone who wants to get married, have kids, loves me for me, and overall just knows how to treat a woman. It be nice if he could text me good morning, check on me throughout the day, send good night texts when we are apart, surprises me with flowers just cause he cares and loves me, kisses me before he leaves for when and when he comes home from work, it be nice to have help around the house besides me doing everything myself, I can understand if he is worn out from work and all I don't expect him to do anything if he don't want to. Is my dream guy really out there or am I going to be alone forever???? If this sounds like you plz feel free to email and if I think we hit off or just want to be a friend I'll give you my number. Anyways I hope you all have a great night, Hope to hear from my dream guy soon...

First of all I have to say that I am a woman who is ready for love! The whole my life I have been dreaming about a strong and loving family, about a caring husband and happy children, I was dreaming to become a happy woman and everybody knows that for every woman the most important is family happiness. Career can't become everything for me. I am sure I can become a good wife and to make the life of my future husband happy. I think I have many good qualities, I am loyal, caring, honest, understanding and sincere person and I am looking for the same qualities in my future man.

The most important for me is to see a strong and caring man by my side, I want him to be a one woman man because I am a one man woman. I want him to be caring, loving, understanding, I want him to treat me with respect to my views and habits. The best man can be compared with a lion, he needs a lioness by his side, and being a king a man will treat his woman like a queen. Of course it is important for me to find a family oriented man because I am here to find a man to get married with, I want to have a family and of course I want him to have the same purpose.so if you read all this and you think you are the man am looking for here use your email address as subject line and a pic so I know you are real don't send me hey hi what up cause I won't respond

Relationships are overrated...says hurt me. SO over hurt me. I've recently discovered that I love a man that is intellectual; hence sapiosexual. Not someone that throws it in your face, but conversing with him you realize, damn he's smart! And I also learned that when I bond or have grown attached to a man, I'm more susceptible to give myself to him; hence demisexual. Not too long ago I wanted friends. I attained a plethora of ""friends"" from here and I was grateful for that. They don't realize how much they've helped me. So, I got what I asked for. I then thought I'd go the route of fwb, emphasis on friend, on other sites because I wanted sex . I never found that. I've come to the realization that even if I found that, I'd just be trying to delay the inevitable; love. All I want is to find love, fall in love, be in love, and be loved. I want a relationship. Is that too much to ask? As of late, it is. I was told to be strong, hold tight, it'll come to you. Yeah, I'm not the getting out type so unless he planned to hit my car, find a way to get in it and wait, show up at my job (s), or knock on my front door, it ain't happening. 

So, here I am on CL, posting an ad in hopes to meet him. I was recently catfished and it discouraged me from trying again. How does a person sleep at night knowing they've just hurt someone's heart like that, making that person feel as if they were emotionally vulnerable and gullible. This person I spoke to and text everyday, saw the beauty in me (even when I didn't), made me feel like the Queen I should be (instead of an ugly duckling), and in that limited time, I fell. Some may say I was crazy, but it's ok. You know how you feel and how someone makes you feel pretty quickly. A bond was formed and for me, it was enough to know that I'd eventually give myself to him. But, unfortunately, I was fooled. My heart was hurt, but what I felt was real. I want that with someone real, and I'm sure there's someone out there wanting the same. SO, this birthday girl, on her last hurrah, is hoping to find that; him. 
If this interests you and you'd like to know more, please respond by putting PILLOWTALK in the subject of your response. I'd love to hear from MEN 35-45. Your pic gets mine, and NOT the other way around. Hope to hear from you...

I consider myself to be honest, caring, affectionate, funny and easy going. I enjoy going out to dinner and then catching a good movie, or maybe just having a nice dinner at home. I believe that there are three things that a relationship must have in order for it to succeed. Those are:
1. Trust

1. Respect

1. Communicationconnection 
I am looking for a man who can be my best friend, my lover and we'll see what happens in the future.
I am looking for someone to go 50/50 with me. Are you that person? 
Send a pic and age ...what you want out of a relationship. White males..age 50-65. D&D free, non smoker and an occasional drink is fine. If you want to text send me your number, please no endless e-mailes or out of State. I am looking for local only. Not into mind games.

First things first,I have been heart broken in the past and right now I want a man to med my heart again, I am not looking for someone that just wants to have some fun or a one night stand I want to feel loved and wanted again, I want the love and affection, if you don't want a real relationship or you're just looking for someone to get in bed with, please do not bother to contact me.
That said, I am a passionate lover and very sincere to the one I'm with. The happy-go-lucky persona won't disappear completely but I get serious when I feel it's the right time and I know I am with the right person.
I am passionate about living life to the fullest and always changing the lens to get a better view of life. I have a fire in my heart seeking to explore this great natural world and all its splendor. I love the outdoors and especially I love the water and sun.
I am a conversational sensual lady, and need someone who's interested and willing to talk as well.I am a very optimist leading lady, a believer in the value and the vitality of life. If you are a visionary, spend quality time around me , and you'll begin to believe it too. My faith is infectious. But unlike most infectious things, it isn't fatal. Just the opposite. It breeds life.
I'm seeking a man that is fun and active, but also knows how to enjoy quality time at home snuggling. I want a man that has some class, but is also comfortable wearing a T-shirt and nice jeans. I want a man that can be real, down to earth, and who's ready to have a best friend in life. If you can't be honest with me, or you don't have the time to invest in this kind of relationship, please don't waste my time or yours..

Not exactly sure what I'm looking for. early 30s gal, born and raised in Oklahoma. I'm a one of a kind, and no, I don't like tooting my own horn. I'm a healthy mixture of the funny girl, the social butterfly, a classic/classy chick, the nerdy book-worm, with a little bit of a rebellious streak, but nothing to crazy. I'm outgoing, love to laugh, love traveling, meeting new people, and having endless conversations about nothing and everything all at once. My best qualities are my sense of humor, my big heart and my intelligence. I value those things about myself, and value them in other people. I love movies, music, books, concerts, and lots of other randomness. I've had a pretty long run of bad luck with relationships, but I'm open to whatever my happen here....I may be looking for love in all the wrong places, but for lack of a better option, here I am. 

I'm looking for someone who is intelligent, funny, romantic, passionate, sensitive, and affectionate...not necessarily in that order. :-) My life is far from perfect, and I don't expect perfection, but I'd like to find someone who at least somewhat has things together. Someone who can talk about anything with anyone. Tall, broad shoulders, beefy, beards and tattoos also help. :-) Just looking to start off with conversation and see where it goes from there. If nothing more than friendship comes of it, it's still be a good day. Between the ages of 25-43 please. 

There's this song, that I've been pretty stuck on lately. It's so beautiful, and pretty romantic...and makes me a little jealous. I want someone to feel this way about me :-). The notion is incredibly romantic, and makes my heart go pitter patter. 

Listen to it, and let me know what you think. Is there a song that defines romance to you? Let's talk about it! Msg me back with the name of your favorite song in the subject line so I know that you aren't spam. 

Listen to ""Nothing Really Matters"" By Mr. Probz. ""Unbroken Promise"" By Erick Baker is another one I'm stuck on. :-)

Also, I am Transgender. That basically means that your gender identity doesn't align with the gender marker given to you at birth based on your biological sex. So yeah I was born male, and have always identified as a woman, so I have been physically transitioning. If you are going to fetishize that and not get to know me as an actual person, I'm not very interested in conversing with you.

I'm a wonderful cook, I'm super clean all the time. I do have a career but right now things aren't going so well with us and need a helping gentle hand. I'm not hard to get along with, my daughter isn't a brat or whining all the time. I am easy to please and I like anything once. I want a relationship to come out of this not just some random thing. You will love the person I am and we will get along great. I am white and I'm seeking the same. 31 years old long dark hair, blue eyes, healthy and in shape. I will share my photos with you once I know you are serious with me. Please in this email provide your name and phone number so that we can speak further.

So, im new to oklahoma in and of itself, along with the okc area and mustang. I'd like to be friends before anything else, for I decided that the next relationship I find myself in will be based upon a foundation of firm trust. Id prefer my next partner to be in their 20's or 30's. I dont have my own vehicle (yet), but i just snagged some steady work. I have traveled all over the West Coast, all the way trying to lift myself up out of heavy poverty. I am approaching 180lbs finally, looking to drop more, so if you want to go out and be active together I am super down. Im not gonna lie, because Ive been lied to sooo much, there have been some ramifications (i.e. im not clean, wrap your fuckin shit kids). I am still battling acne, and it fucks with my head still. Lol. 

So, after leading with the worst, here are my good qualities. I love to write, I enjoy EDM and enjoy dancing to bassy music. Im down with underground consciousness raising rap and hip hop. I am honest, and loyal - the type of girl who'd seranade you ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" and truly mean it (hahaha! corny, right?!). I love the outdoors and camping; it calms and feeds my soul. I have an education and am at least booksmart. I cook, clean, and pamper you, especially if its returned. I also tend to be of a submissive nature, so for all you gentlemanly doms out there.... Well, im gonna leave it at that, and cross my fingers that I get at least one decent reply. Thanks for making it thus far! Reply with ""I feel you"" in the subject line so I know you are real! Blessed be, namaste.

Hello Reader
I know they say you cannot find anything good on CL but I hope not. My intuition tells me there are some real, loving , genuine men still out there searching for Love and Happiness. I have heard people say you dont need love to be happy but think about it, you cant be happy if you dont feel loved.

Anyway I m on CL to get my man. A man who would sweep me off my feet , who would be my shinning armour , a man who would be day dreaming when I m not with him. My man has to be humble, loving, kind, and wants to be with a good woman.
I have so much love to offer that I dont want my love to waste, it has to go to the right man. I m very optimistic, he is out there looking for me too.
Lets prove the world wrong, lets show the world that Love does exist and it is real.

Please dont message me if your over 40 or if your going through a divorce or just getting out of a relationship. Also please put your name in the subject line thank you.

I'm looking for a man to get to know and become good friends plus more with. I'm not looking for friends with benefits or hookups. I'm looking for something that will lead towards a long term relationship. I don't want to rush anything, looking to take my time and get to know someone first. I don't want to post a lot on here, so I'll just post the basics until we message. I have my own place, vehicle and a good job. I can handle my own and look for the same in a man. I'm not into the club or party scene, although I will go out every once in a blue moon. I'm caring, honest and loyal. If interested, send me a message and a pic and I will send one in return. :)

Hey there!

I miss having a connection with someone.. I miss cuddling, making out, someone playing with my hair, and just having someone being there for me. I wanna be there for someone as well. I like to text/talk a lot..  I wanna find someone who is at least 22 and under 40.. I don't really mind what you look like.. your personality is what matters to me. I don't have children.

I am 5'6, ""curvy,"" brownish blonde hair, and bluish green eyes.

I'm not just looking for sex. I want to build a relationship with someone. I have a car, a job, and I am a student. 

I'll send pic once I receive yours.. I can't put one on my ad because of my job.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Are there any attractive, fit and sexy men between the age of 40 and 50, out there looking for the same things I am?


What I am looking for is an outgoing and fun loving guy who knows how to have a good conversation as well as how to have a good time without any strings attached or a commitment. I would like to find that special guy who can be a friend as well as a lover. 


A little about me. I'm a white, tall, slim lady with dark hair and eyes. I like fishing, boating, motorcycle riding, being outdoors, long walks, sitting on the porch swing, staying in shape, dancing, cookouts, camping and lots of other things. 


I am a very affectionate, passionate  and sensual woman. I love sex but only with a guy that I can really connect with. The connection has to be there. I'm not looking to jump from bed to bed but rather that special guy who I can connect with out of bed first and then if all goes well definitely in bed. 


I am drug and disease free. You must be too. I do occasionally drink and don't mind if you do but I don't want someone who just gets sloppy drunk. 


If you think you might be interested in an arrangement like this, please write me. If you don't take the time to attach a recent face and profile picture then don't waste your time because I won't reply. Looks are not everything but if there is not some attraction then it won't work. I will return the favor. 


Thank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to hearing from you.

A friend of mine called me this morning and said that their would be music in Bricktown; starting at noon. I looked it up online and found Metro Music Fest. Is anyone going to be in Bricktown this afternoon? I thought I would go to Bricktown this afternoon and check it out; have some lunch somewhere in Bricktown. I do not go very often because it isn't fun for me to go alone. Since I am going to be checking this event out; I thought that it would be a fun atmosphere to meet someone new.

I am divorced, unattached, a mom (my kid is grown/married), I live alone, and I am in the NW OKC area. I would like to have a fun loving friend to hang out with; go places, go out to eat, shopping, scenic drives, walking... I am not interested in a sexual encounter. If this friendship turns into romance; that would be fine. I am just looking for a good friend.

I do not know OKC area very well. I moved up here about a year ago. I am still adjusting to the city life. It would be nice to connect with a man who knows OKC area very well and knows of some fun places that we could go together. 

I enjoy a variety of things.... gardening, browsing antique shops, reading, live music, festivals, powerwalking, swimming, scenic drives, Christmas Lights, ... are a few of my interests.

I am a non smoker; prefer a non smoker. I do not do drugs. I can not handle drinking alcohol. I am a bubbly fun loving personality. I tend to see the good in people before I see the bad. 

It is a beautiful day today. I hope to connect with a new friend:)

I've been waiting for my Prince Charming to come riding in on a white horse. When he didn't show I thought he was lost riding a slow turtle. Now I've came to the conclusion he's been hit by a bus.

I'm bright, a bit impetuous, sophisticated if needed and amusing with my vivacious personality.

Since Prince Charming is no where to be found the next best thing would be a dashing gentlemen that's courageous, perceptive, creative and venturesome. But above all, must love to laugh!

I seek a white man in my age range. Please between 45 to 55. If these particular qualities identifies you, I'd enjoy hearing from you.

Please respond with a little something about yourself and a G-rated picture would be wonderful.

If your married or attached I'm not interested. If your out of state or the country I'm not interested

I wanted to see if there were other people out there with Herpes 2 that were interested in dating. I know there are a lot of people that have it and either don't date or act like they don't have it. But the fact is that a significant portion of the population has it. Hit me up if you would like to talk about it.
