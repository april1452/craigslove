I've been waiting for my Prince Charming to come riding in on a white horse. When he didn't show I thought he was lost riding a slow turtle. Now I've came to the conclusion he's been hit by a bus.
' 
I'm bright, a bit impetuous, sophisticated if needed and amusing with my own personal sparkle. 

Since Prince Charming is no where to be found the next best thing would be a dashing gentlemen that's courageous, perceptive, creative and venturesome. But above all, must love to laugh!

I seek a white man in my age range. Please between 40 to 55. If these particular qualities identifies you, I'd enjoy hearing from you.

Please respond with a little something about yourself and a G-rated picture would be wonderful.

If your married or attached I'm not interested. If your out of state or the country I'm not interested.

I am a woman who has become curious as to why men act the way they do. I mean women are just as messed up but men say they are looking for something specific and when someone better than they expected reaches out to them; they don't even have the decency to respond with a ""No thanks"". Has everyone lost their manners? 

Anyway I'm looking for a decent looking guy who is tall, decent body, and honest, respectful, loving, caring and wants a friend to start out with. I like many different things because I am a unique woman. I love watching most sports, movies, live bands, and going to have fun dancing. I also enjoy quiet time reading, watching movies, and just chilling out. 

Hopefully this will get to an honest person. Please reply by changing the title to your favorite singer or band and include a picture or probably won't get a response.

Non-smoker, single white female looking for the same. I would prefer someone who is 47 - 60, happy with their life and career and someone looking for a friend first with the hope that it would turn into a long term relationship.

It's that time of year where I would love nothing more than to be wrapped up in the arms of a wonderful man.

I'm a good, honest woman who likes to pamper my man. I grew up a country girl and even though I live in the city now, it's only because my career brought me here. But now I'm in the position where I can do my work from anywhere with a high speed data connection, so I want to get back to my country roots. 
I want to settle down with a man who is living alone, no kids at home. Grown kids are ok but just not living at home. I want my man to appreciate a woman who pampers him. I like to keep a nice house, cook and sit on your lap and hug and kiss you when you get home. I want a man who knows what it means trust and talk about everything. 
I am 54, successful professional. Considered pretty by most men. Been told recently that I'm very sensuous. I feel sensuous. I'm very busty, not a thin girl, but also not BBW, I'm curvy, great legs. 
I'm a Tom Boy outdoors, love farm animals, 4 wheeling and working the garden...and I'm ""all woman"" indoors. 
I'm attracted to taller men (over 5'10""), strong to stocky built, ruggedly good looking (but attraction has so many levels). I like a relatively clean cut guy, goatees are nice...just not into the ""Billy Bob"" types. And he MUST be a country man.

Im tired high school games, cheaters, liars and men who say they want a relationship but dont really seem to know what that means. Where r the good fellas at? A man who walks by faith, integrity, respects himself and others . Im not about pushing my beliefs down anyones throat but if u meet or chat with me u will know I am a christian and im not perfect by no means but I try my best and believe in a relationship with christ rather than a religion. Im very easy to talk to, easy going, dont do drama and try to live as stress and Drama free as possible, I love most anything outdoors , travel , cooking, sports , bowling, flea markets, yard sales, shopping , hanging with fam/friends . If you decide to contact me please send a recent pic and be single/divorced between the ages of 30-46 , Hwp, stable with no drama , good job, vehicle etc.. wouldnt ask of something im not able to coming to the table myself with.

Hey there!

I miss having a connection with someone.. I miss cuddling, making out, someone playing with my hair, and just having someone being there for me. I wanna be there for someone as well. I like to text/talk a lot.. I wanna find someone who is at least 22 and under 40.. I don't really mind what you look like.. your personality is what matters to me. I don't have children.

I'm not just looking for sex. I want to build a relationship with someone. I have a car, a job, and I am a student. 

I'll send pic once I receive yours.. I can't put one on my ad because of my job.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

*put your favorite movie in the subject line.*

Looking for someone to get to know and is serious about wanting a relationship. If you're not interested in big girls please don't respond I like to laugh. smile, and have fun. Not looking for someone who only wants a bootycall. Does anyone really date anymore? I enjoy movies, music, bowling, and love spending time outdoors. I listen to all kinds of music. I am single and have one child. I'm not into the club or party scene. I'm in church every sunday. Laid back and easy going. I have pics that I can send once we chat a little bit. Looking to eventually settle down and be serious. What I'm looking for is a man that likes to have fun yet doesn't mind staying in every once in awhile. Someone who wants to take the time to get to know each other. Must love music and smiling. I am looking for a black man. Be a man that knows how to take initiative. That means know how to make plans for dates not just hangout. Be a grown man. Not looking for a text buddy. Please be honest and truly single.Please when you reply put your favorite football team in the subject so I know you are real.
