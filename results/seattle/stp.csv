Bored as fuck at work. Hit me up on kik. 

Craigslist says this is too short. So I will tell a story to make craigslist happy. 

There once was a man named joe. Joe thought craigslists restriction on posts for their length was stupid. Joe then made a rant on Craigslist about the restriction. Joe was then banned from craigslist. Joe doesn't care. Because joe has a life. 

Be like joe.

I am a married white male with an desk job open to casual emails, maybe some flirting or possibly more. Just looking for that one woman who is sitting at home drinking coffee reading these ads for fun but doesn't usually respond. Marriage is ok but missing that spark or connection for many years. Would love to meet someone in similar situation who is open to talking but not sure they want to take it further. I have never been with another woman but not opposed to it with the right person. 
I am an attractive HWP man, down to earth, mid 40's, great sense of humor, witty and sarcastic at times. I can be a little shy at the start but if I feel a connection with someone I can open up pretty easily. Looking for similar in a woman.
Maybe just emailing, flirting, possibly meeting for coffee or ?. Hope to hear from you.

I'm looking for a buddy or hopefully a few buddies to chill and just be dudes with. Nothing weird, I'm not looking for a massage, a partner, some weird fetish... just friends. I'm a beer drinking, food eating, sports fan and video game playing straight dude. I don't have any problems with anyone who is gay as long as there is no expectations or needs in that department. 

I am 24 and on Craigslist because my friends are thinning out. Some of my friends have joined the military, got jobs in other states, ignore their friends when they start dating someone. You name it. I have a small group of friends and I'd like to be a bit more diverse when it comes to friends. I'm hoping to find someone close by or in the lynnwood area who's not a flake.

I'm a jokester who likes to laugh and make others laugh, I play games but I wish I had more time. I have a huge collection of video games that are on all the current consoles. I go to new breweries often because I enjoy trying new beers. I'm responsible, have a decent paying job for my age and no college education. I'm a good friend to have. I'm always there for my buddies if they need anything. I have a girlfriend and that's why I'm looking for guy friends. Not too many girlfriends like there boyfriends hanging out with girls.

Not that it should matter too much but I'm 5'10"" 180 pounds, average height and weight for the most part

Well I'm the man for the job! We can arrange a time to meet and set up the incidentals, or you can just inquire through email. My expertise behind the camera and you in front of the camera in exchange for free photos for you, and for myself that I use to build my portfolio. I will only use photos you allow me to use in my portfolio, and no photos are shared anyplace without specific written permission by you. I am not a professional, just a practicing hobbyist. That benefits you by having quality amateur photos being at no charge and for me just to sharpen my skills and enjoy a hobby. I mainly do on location, which means a place you arrange or set up.

So I travel the US and the world. Do it fairly regularly hence why I keep coming back to this state -there's so much to explore on day trips. Traveling in country I can still do on my own and do on a fairly/semi regular basis. I don't mind actually as I can explore on my own without time limits or other constraints from others. But I do like to travel with people when traveling internationally -if for no other reason than to be able to talk to another outsider ...and having another set of eyes and another brain doesn't hurt when trying to locate crap lol as well as making the overall trip cheaper. Anyway got some trips in the works -in both Asia and in Europe so hit me up if interested. Basically you pay for your way and I mine but I do have the Philippines pretty well covered if that temps you -it's a tropical island and my aunt owns a resort and I have family that lives over there... and food/drink is dirt cheap lol :)

It would be nice to fellowship with a young lady and see what happens. I live/work in Tacoma. Open to women of all ages and races. I'm active in my church and maybe we can visit each other's church. I enjoy sports, exercise, current events, movies, eating out, etc.

I guess you can say I'm fairly new to the area. I've been here for a couple years now and I have yet to make any real close friends. This is technically my first time being far away from all my family and friends I grew up with so in turn I don't think I even know how to make friends as an adult lol 
I'm a mom & wife and I am extremely happy in my marriage and I am only looking for friends not anything else. I feel I have to emphasize that point because I tried finding friends this way when we first moved here and it was a total disaster. The one girl I met and hung out with a few times essentially wanted a friends with benefits type situation so yea no. 😐
I'm hoping to find friends with kids maybe even kids around my kids ages. Although it's not a must. I have a 4 & 6 yr old. And if you haven't guessed it yet, I am a stay at home mom. I have recently begun using my YMCA membership for working out and not just somewhere to take my kids when I need a break. If you workout at the Y maybe we can workout together if our schedules coincide? I'm a very shy person at first but once I'm comfortable I'm a chatter box. I love movies, reading, shopping, photography, dancing, food, and a couple tv shows, I love getting massages and mani/pedis when I can. I do on occasion drink. I dont smoke anything. Im definitely a very family oriented person. I'm not a flake and one of my biggeat pet peeves is when people come to my house unannounced lol 
I know so much random info right? Just wanted to give a bit of what I'm about and what I'm like so if we have anything in common please email me!

My name is Christina, 33 yr old kinda newbie of Washington and p/s I hate this weather!

I must be out of my mind to think I'll meet a smart, attractive and truly funny woman on CL looking to befriend an attached dude for a platonic exploit. But what the hell. I'll either prove myself right after receiving replies from nothing but guys masquerading as women and hooker bots...or perhaps someone will prove me wrong. If you're here reading this, you'll know who you are. 

I'm late 40s, live and work in Seattle as a so-called ""professional"", am well educated, fit and married. Too much is missing in my day to day life to be truly satisfied and I'm hoping to make contact with someone in a similar situation who is looking for an outlet to share some giggles...or even tears. 

Why does attraction matter in strictly platonic? Because it just does, as much as I know that makes little rational sense! 

If you think we may be a good fit, drop me a note which says something about who you are and why this post intrigues you and let's see what happens next.

Hey hey - 

Hope all is well for you guys out there! I'm a 27 year old gay gamer looking for other fellow gamers. I mainly play RPG/Action/Fighter/FPS video games on consoles like PS4, 3DS/WiiU or my Vita. However, I have had quite an interest in board games recently. I've only played a handful of board games but would not be opposed to meeting others who are interested video/board games.

I've lived here for over a year and would like to expand my circle of friends. I'm a 5'8"" latino with a stocky build. I'd say. I can be very introverted at first but once I feel pretty comfortable, my true colors show. I absolutely love to laugh and make other laugh all the time :D 
I regularly 420 via edibles but smoke every so often, so if you're cool with that -- awesome!

I'm hoping to find friends who like to play multiplayer games like Smash Bros, COD, ect. I'd like a reason to get out of the house and chill/play video games.

Although this ad may be target toward other gaming buddies, I do not want to restrict it to just gaming. I also enjoy checking out Seattle, eating at new places, COOKING for others, shopping, walking around and just having all around fun.

I am also looking to find a friend I can be sexually open with. I don't have many friends that I openly talk to about sex. I would very much enjoy having a mate who would like to occasionally jerk off and cuddle. 

If this sounds like something you're looking for, drop me a line.

Just looking to meet people in Seattle. I live in North Seattle, Northgate, near Ballard/Shoreline. I like video games, cooking/baking, animals, hiking, fitness (although I'm expecting in July so I can't do any heavy duty lifting atm lol). I'm 420 friendly but don't smoke myself. I'm happily in a relationship and have a dog and cat. I'm pretty quiet until I get to know you but I'm also blunt and truthful. I'm not religious but don't care if you are as long as you aren't trying to convert me. I'm pretty open minded about a lot of things and hoping to find other people to hangout with who are as well. Whether it's just hanging out cooking and watching Netflix, playing games (board games, card games, and Xbox one), going for a workout, hiking with my dog..really anything. I'm thinking of learning how to knit and sow. I love DIY stuff and thrifting. Not big into shopping but do love a good bargain hunt!

Really just looking for other females who are layer back and looking for some Seattle buddies to hangout with!

Email me and if you have an Instagram you can definitely send that too so I get your vibe (I have one too) but either way just hit me up!

This may seem strange and is, but I have fathered three children during/in my marriage, Plus two or three others using my sperm to help relatives of my ex-wife. One was by invetro another was by eggs harvested and with a surrogate mother. The third time was kinda strange (on the cheap), my wife provided enough to a gay friend for a DIY. (I never asked how! But she also had a healthy child.)
So that is a total of six health children. I have lost or never had contact with the last three children, The youngest would now be in his/her late teens. I'm told, through other family connections that the three, from donor sperm are all highly intelligent and high achievers as are my own three sons.

A few years ago, my ex-wife contacted me about doing this again, I had my sperm tested and even in my 60s it still tested good. This donation never happened due to other family problems.

Why am I here? Over the past few months I have seen several posts here on CL for sperm donations and I have responded to several of them, offering mine. I have yet to have any takers and I can only assume it is because of my age. Well, you should talk with you fertility specialist and get their opinion. I know from my experience, it really doesn't seem to matter. 

I don't ask for anything and if you can afford the lab type invetro fine. Or, if money is tight, my sperm is freely given and you can DIY. (""if at first you don't succeed, try, try again!"") 

As I state above, I don't ask for anything, but really that would be irresponsible of me since I want the best for any child and since I have a choice here, I want make sure they will be born into a loving and happy home. And with all the opportunities my own natural children have. For that reason and at the parents option I want to offer to stay in touch with the parents and perhaps in time with the child. 

Think this over and if your seriously interest, just reply and we can discuss or have a Q&A on the details. (I'm not getting any younger but my Sperm is fresh daily!)

Are you sick and tired of not being able to find new opportunities to meet new peeps? Are you like me and feel secluded sometimes?
And have you wondered why skinny jean wearing dudes do the things they do, staring down at their phones, and not giving the respect of the presence of the person that they are with and not giving two pissies between the difference of 'reality' and the amount of instagram followers they have? Lets go for a walk at the park sometime!!!

K here's the deal. I'm in my late twenties. A hardworking honest guy who has been caught in the thick of the crowd, and lets face it we have all had it rough but I'm not looking for pity. I would like a sense of self-worth and genuine awareness of finding a friend outside of the crowd! 

I'm a bit old-fashioned, still behind the curve when it comes to the aforementioned technology. I get the lingo to facebook, twitter, etc. I choose not to have an account created for them. 

I like hanging out with my friends, netflix, chill time, rock climbing, watching all of the Quentin Tarantino movies from the past couple of decades, still like Pokemon, I also enjoy archery, play the guitar, have interested in subjecting my body to more pain treatment (haha I have a few tattoos so far...) and you will never meet someone like me based on my interests hobbies and personality!

Go ahead and feel free to respond to this if you dare muah-hahaha

Hello out there!! 

There comes a time in your life where you realize that you need a few great friends or that one best friend. This is what I am after. I am a unique individual who loves to be adventurous and dabble in all sorts of fun. I just noticed that all of my friends have a best friend, and I still don't who is local. I just seem to not feel a connection with anyone but it's not going to stop me from trying. 

About me- 

I am 38, I'm happily married (and by happily married, I truly mean that) I have two amazing boys who are the starshine and sunshine of my planet. We live in Tukwila and have been here for the last two years. We moved here from Oregon, so that is another reason why I am seeking friends on craigslist. I work full time during the week. 

I am terrible at this sort of thing. I am not an emailer, and it seems that most of the people that I do meet off here just want to email back and forth. I will not do that. I think my email limit is three, this is the first. . .
So if that is something that you plan to do, I am not your girl. With that said, I have recently figured out that I really need to have a connection before meeting up. I am spread pretty thin as most are, and meeting several people per week will just be too much. I will be down to meet up with someone I feel connected with, so it's going to have to be texts first. 

I have a gypsy soul. I'm eclectic, I am quirky and fun, but usually reserved at first. I am that person who would do anything for anyone. I am open and honest, non judgmental and completely mentally stable. I enjoy to be happy and in a great mood. I do not do well with over- negativity, mean spirited people or preachy people. Everyone says that they don't like drama, but I repel it. I am spiritual. This might sound odd, but agnostic -pagan (raddest thing ever would be for someone to get that). I am not going to change my mind, so I really don't want people to try for it bores me. Politics are just not my thing but this election tho!!! 

I am a music lover of all types (all kinds, but rap, r & b, bluegrass, folk and rockabilly are my right now favs (I am aware of the crazy mix), art, books, antiques, shopping, being girly, movies, nutrition, tattoo's, dancing, walking, collecting feathers, coffee & tea, gardening, concerts, succulents, jug bands, vaudeville. I love going to concerts when possible, small or big shows. I love anything vintage, rusty, musty and in bad condition. Antique shopping, thrift & book stores or walking the beach looking for driftwood is where you can usually find me. I am very into mindfulness and meditation. I love to wander downtown with my cuppa coffee in hand and explore new tasty foods & shopping. I am a girly girl, but not too willing to spend too much on maintenance. I'd rather do it myself. I love the written word, movies, dancing, adventure. I can cook something fierce, and love to entertain. 

I am very into nutrition. I am extremely happy with myself and even my body. However; I am trying to get into perfect health, and work out a lot. I am addicted to my fitbit. It would be nice to meet someone who is also working on that, while not having extreme body image issues. 

I am looking for someone who is like minded, kind, daring, fun. Between the ages of 30-40. Married or not, don't really care. Kids, great but mine won't be tagging along as they are older. I work 8-5 m-f. Don't care if you do or not, but those are my normal hours. l'd love to find someone willing to meet up, talk on the phone once in a while, and spend some good ol fashioned ""girl time"" with. I would love to meet someone up for dancing, concerts- shows, thrift shopping, garage sale-ing, going downtown, working out, seeing a chick flick. For me, life is too short for excuses, I like to live in the now. My only real requirement is that you must be in the same frame of mind for having a friendship. No sourpusses or chronically depressed, no fakes and most importantly be genuine. 

If you think I might be someone you could get along with, hit me up. I know my best friend is out there, so I'll keep posting this til I find her.

Thanks for reading.

Hi! 
I recently moved to Lacey and could use a chill, relaxed friend. I'm a girl who's down to earth, loves to learn, outdoorsy, and very goofy. You should be kind, open, funny, and smart. Oh and 420 friendly :) I don't drink hard alcohol, but wine and beer sometimes. I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 4 years.

I'm not materialistic, I'm more of a natural girl and health conscious. I like to crochet, sew, paint, and learn all types of new skills. 

I feel like I would be fine living like they did in the olden days, minus the dysentery. Haha. Just the idea of living off the land, making things myself, and being in nature seems peaceful.

I dislike mainstream media 
and music. I feel like it's dumbing down soceity.

I love spending time outdoors camping, fishing, vegetable gardening, beekeeping, and exploring nature. I love our mother earth and I enjoy being active. I am very much into being one with the earth. I really like walking barefoot when it's warm.

I'm not into partying, drama or gossip. I don't like being mean or negative. I like good vibes and creating good intentions.

I watch documentaries, learn about natural law, natural healing, health, nutrition, fitness, chinese medicine, native american cultures, psychology, physics, history, and science.

If you feel like we could get along, shoot me an email :)

Hey there! We are a glorious young adult trifecta looking for some quality friends. Our relationships to each other: two sisters, plus the partner of one sister. We thought we'd be upfront about the fact that we're mostly always together. All relatively new to the Tacoma area, we are having a hard time making connections organically outside of busy professional lives. It's difficult finding the space to meet people with similar interests when you are looking for friendship, not a romantic relationship.

Some interests of mine (the married sister) include cooking adventurous new recipes, going to new restaurants (recently we went on a doughnut crawl, followed by a slow quest for Tacoma's best pizza that we, my partner, sister, and I, could use some help on), seeing movies at The Grand Cinema, occasionally going to sporting events, always going to new breweries, running, slam poetry, and drag shows, among other things. I love Andrea Gibson, hard cider/IPA's, cheese, talking about film, and hosting dinner parties. Some of my favorite movies are Donnie Darko, American Beauty, Spotlight, Burnt, Doubt, The Other Sister, and Jaws. I'm honestly not huge into music, but I think this makes me a good ride-along buddy because I'm not picky about what's playing in the car. A few things I'd really like to do with a new friend would be to try a couple of the newer breweries in Tacoma, perhaps read a book together (mini-book club!), watch Netflix and bake stuff, and mainly, just get to know each other and support each other. I'm more interested in an actual consistent friendship than someone to have occasional crazy adventures with.

Some of my interests (I'm the sister/eternal third wheel) include movies, modern art, crafting, lindy hop, and antiques. My favorite movies are Fantastic Mr. Fox, Argo, Spotlight, and Her. I love crocheting and reading. I am a fan of beer and whiskey, and most foods. I am looking for fun meaningful friendships!

If you're looking for this pod of awesomeness, please shoot us a message with your favorite beer or cider as the subject line! We're looking for either groups or individuals to hang with.

I boast a love of board games that is way too high for my amount of friends. I'd also really like to get into MTG, but that require other people to play. Basically if you enjoy playing board/card games (it doesn't really matter what kind, almost all are super fun) and have time on your hands, feel free to send me an email. The ability to deal with snarky quips without getting offended is a major plus, as well as basically any other nerdy obsession possible to humanity, especially Star Trek. I'm very asexual, so I really mean strictly plutonic. I don't really care if you do drugs, but if its the biggest part of your personality and you can't hang out with anyone without getting high or talk about anything else, you might want to reconsider.

I am a pretty good looking guy if I say so myself, but I am a single father of two beautiful girls, that keep Daddy on his toes. I am not looking for anything sexual. Not looking for any emotional drama, I am just looking for a woman or women who are looking for the opposite male counterpart for going out, being that wingman for ya, and you can be my wingwoman for me. Bring your lady friends, thats fine, its all platonic. Again, I love being a father, its the best job ever, but sometimes, its fun to spend time with other company outside my current circle of friends, and outside my circle of work friends. 

Life is too short, I would just like to meet a woman or women who just want to explore something, groupon something, check out a movie, then go home back to our lives, grab dinner, catch up, then go home back to our daily lives..etc.. You get the picture.

Me... for the most part, just a regular single father, I work out, I am not a gym rat, but I do have muscles in the places that matter, meaning my brain! Ha! What were you thinking. Seriously, I work in IT, I am a nerd by day, goofy 24x7, have a home, car, two great kids, pay 90% of my bills, that toll bill is just killing me right now! Just a regular guy. Please care about your health, your looks, as I do. I am not perfect, and I don't need a barbie doll of a friend( but if you are, thats great too!), but it you like to work out and or do events like the tough mudder, or warrior dash, you can join me! The Warrior Dash is this July, I am training for it. They say opposites attract. I say they do, and I also say the same people attract, when its all about friendship. If you are just friends, it doesn't matter if you don't agree on topics, respect each other and what they believe, and keep it moving. Life is too short for drama. I am easy to talk to. I am non judgemental. I don't care what you did in your past, as long as it didnt involve hurting kids. Your past is your past, I wasn't there, so I don't have a right to judge your choices you make. I will always speak my mind and tell you my two cents. 

Repeat I am not in need of sex, I can get that elsewhere. Yes I am single, but I am not looking for sex from you(ya'll). I think that covers it..... Oh, and no I don't need you to come over to my house the first few times we meet. rather know the person that I am getting to know is sane!

Have a great weekend and rest of your week. Be safe.

Oh, and please be color blind, meaning race doesnt matter to you, cause it doesn't matter to me.

I'm posting here in the plutonic area because I realized after a few dates that I am not ready for jumping in and finding my next ex. I do miss adult companionship to go do things with. I work hard and would like to play hard too. My weekend consisted of going for a walk, going shopping, going out to eat, going to the casino just to have a drink and people watch and going to the movies... By Myself! Yes it's good to get out but it's embarrassing sometimes. People stare, feel sorry for me or I attract the ones who have liquor bravery, think I'm desperately lonely and have no standards or they see a neon ""come play me"" light with an arrow pointing my way. Sometimes when I go out I am reminded why I don't want to go out, well not alone anyways. I don't want to miss out on life and experiences and cool stuff and ""dating"" is not the answer for me at this time. I am not emotionally available for romance, right now it seems like ""the one"" for me just simply does not exist and I desire the impossible or just can't have my cake and eat it too. I accept this and live accordingly but someone to share things and experiences with is on my mind. I am a single white female, unique, attractive, good job, place, fun, loyal, sexy, no drugs, social drinks sometimes, 420 friendly... Thrill seeker but also like cozy relaxing moments... I don't date white men because I am not playboy centerfold material or a live flexi doll and Huh!? or Duh??? are not the biggest words in my vocabulary. I do have common interests like nature and hiking, camping, bonfires, music, BBQ, family, concerts, travel and road trips, festivities and more... There's just never a mutual physical attraction. Also, most black men I've met don't share my same passion for nature and thrill seeking and hate Washington and the weather. My personality is kind of eccentric, I like a well balanced mix of work & play, serious & silly and so on. Things I would like to do ""not alone"" are: travel, road trips, concerts, dinners, fairs and festivities, movies, roasting hot dogs and making smores... I really truly seek a trusting friend, partner in crime so to speak (not literally) and someone to confide in... vise sersa. Journey, explore, experience and take pictures- Lot's of pictures :) I want to go to Vegas in the very near future, a small group of fun girls and a man would be fun lol Also camping, I reserve the same spot every year for up to 12 people but this year I have only a few friends that may be able to go. I have looked into classes like cooking and photography & art and that meet ups thing but everything is so far and few in-between and I'm not looking to be a certified chef or own a $6000.00 camera. Can I just use my Samsung Galaxy!?? Something else I want to do is Geocatching- I tried once and had a blast! I also love the market (Pikes Place) I would like to discover other places to get fresh produce and unique herbs and spices... Spring and summer on the way- Lot's to do!!! And for Fall, my favorite! The colors and smells and coziness and HALLOWEEN!!! I like all holidays actually and am a go all out person too. I think I just need trusting friends and day by day things just seem better and then one day when someone asks how you are and you reply ""good"" you actually mean it :)

Im also obsessed with Batman ^o^

-no, I wont hack someones fb for you (I get asked a lot)

Here's a little about me: I have no children but do enjoy them. I have two Boxers that I spoil rotten. I like to cook more than baking, but do both. I enjoy taking spontaneous weekend trips and most day trips. I have a passion for learning and am always interested in new and different things. I love going to fairs and festivals, reading, second hand shopping,, binging on Netflix, taking care of my chickens and turkeys. I enjoy doing crafts and have quite an extensive supply of materials for making greeting cards and other paper crafts. I live on a 20+ acre timber tree farm between Snohomish and Granite falls. I spend time gardening with herbs, vegetables, flowers and fruit trees. I am currently planning the spring garden and potting seeds to start indoors. I am from Los Angeles, corporate America, and relocated to WA 9 years ago. I'm 54 but on most days I feel younger or older, but then again, what does 54 feel like? 

I am hoping to find friends with shared interests who just want to spend some time enjoying life. If we have interests in common send me an email and ler's have some fun.

Hi,

So, I'm the guy that shouldn't be on Craigslist. Why, you ask? What makes me so special? 

Well.. I have a doctorate degree, I'm fairly attractive, social, generally good with women (although my game has taken a hit here in Seattle, I mean c'mon, the dating scene here stinks), I'm financially well-off, I'm not married, divorced, kids, or STD's. Hmm. Sounds like a decent situation huh? I'm cool too. I might not participate in certain shit-shows (because of my career), but that doesn't mean I won't cheer you on. I let you be you. The best you. 

I'll be honest, socially I'm generally ""the man"" in other places I've lived but I've struggled a lot in Seattle. Maybe blame it on the freeze? I don't know. But that's why I'm here.

You:
You feel guilty for being on craigslist, or maybe you don't but your friends would feel guilty for you. You KNOW you could do so much better. And not because you live in Bonney Lake with your 2nd child on your arm, and you're bored because you've been out of work for a year and you're ""so"" done with this town. No no dear, you just need to find a new hobby. The type of woman I'm talking about, this woman... she KNOWS she shouldn't be on craigslist because you have a graduate degree (or are in a well secure career with your bachelors), you're attractive, independent, you're healthy and cool, and maybe like me you're struggling a bit meeting friends or people that inspire you.... Well until you read this. Because that's over now. So, Hit me baby, one more time! I'm waiting for you. 

Race doesn't matter. Clearly I'm black. So minorities are cool, and cool white people are cool too. :) Age 24-35? I think that's fair. Big booties to the front of the line. Awesome wing women will tell others to get IN-LINE. 

Send a pic or no reply! :)

So here's my story...

I'm 36 year old comedian that is also a stay at home dad because of a child with severe autism. I also do a bit of acting. My wife has encouraged me to seek out a best friend, due to the fact the last two I thought were that person ended up not having the qualities of being that.

I have more female friends than male, I just prefer it because I understand women (raised by my aunt and grandma) and am such a loving person.

About me:
- Funny 
- Loving 
- Honest 
- I don't believe in breaking promises 
- I'm am affectionate towards people I love (hugs and cuddles) 
- Love Movies
- Loyal
- I'm drama free (I'm a good guy, and my wife trusts me and likes all my friends) (Also she at one point made a serious suggestion about becoming a professional cuddler, she knows)
- No, I don't want anything more than a bestie (no side chicks, FWB, or etc)
- I always open to a variety of stuff, but because of the complexity of my daughter, I don't bring people over for her comfort.
- Love Karaoke 
- Don't Smoke of anything, but do socially Drink (If you smoke or 420, that's cool, I just don't)

There's so much more, but I want to hear some about you first. Be serious about wanting a bestie, I have friends. 

Send a pic and tell me about yourself. Put your favorite TV show in the subject. So I can delete the spam.

Talk Soon,

Love trips to goodwill, Obsessed with sugar gliders and own 2. Not afraid of laughing at myself. 

fav tv shows: the walking dead, Outlander, Gilmore girls, New Girl, love DIY network show, I like cheesy shows like ""married at first sight"", Love a lot of comedy but blanking on which ones haha. 

fav movie: never been kissed and cry baby 

boyfriend is an ex-skater boy, likes playing GTA on xbox, and watching scary movies, playing football for fun with some coworkers, soon to start a 2 year mechanics program, likes to pretend he can rap and sometimes tries to make music, he's from the east coast, likes making jokes and a super genuinely nice guy.

And meeting ladies in public? Its very hard when you are a little shy at first. There has to be a lady out there somewhere looking for a active, fun, oldschool, hopeless romantic? But where where????

I grew up in a small town and attended a Baptist Church like many other good little boys. This extraordinarily precocious girl, C. S., also attended the church. I knew her all through junior high and high school. She wore these exceedingly tight skirts, nylons, and heels, tight knit blouses too. Since our preacher had convinced us that we were going to roast in hell for our wayward thoughts, mine seemingly, inevitably, became even more stimulated, wayward, and elaborate. I still remember the parties where she wore similar things, perhaps even tighter fitting, than she wore in church. She would sit on my lap and I would rest my hand on her textured nylon legs. I suspect she knew full well what was going on beneath her.
I wish that I could go back to that time and place knowing what I know now.
Any C.S.'s out there who always wanted to make it with the smartest, most sought after, best athlete in town? who went on to the big city and to some very rewarding things but who has always had you in the back of his mind somewhere, wondering if you were feeling the same thing he was all those years? Perhaps still are? Even platonically. Then there was S. S. and K. S. too.
Appreciation and/or quid pro quo's of all sorts considered.
Take me back and forward. Hint: small logging town; G. Creek

Looking for women who are interested in vaginal massage. Yes, I am serious about this. I've placed this ad in the strictly platonic section because I was getting undesireable responses in the casual encounters section. I am not looking for a sexual hookup. Please read further and I will explain everything. If you are under 30 years of age, please do not respond.

I want to provide as much as possible a professional vaginal massage. I won't be massaging/stimulating you in any other way. If that's what you're looking for, move on. A typical session would last 30 to 45 minutes. I will be massaging the inside of the vagina only, avoiding the glands of the G-spot and the A-spot. No external massage will be done or should be expected by you. It WILL NOT be my intention for you to have an orgasm. That is not the goal. The goal is to massage all around the vaginal walls to increase tone of the muscle. The massage will start gentle and increase in intensity. However, I will never use more pressure than what you want. I will be using latex or nitrile gloves (if you're allergic to latex). And I will be using a water based lubricant of your choice that you need to provide.

There are specific benefits of vaginal massage. The vagina is a muscle and without regualar ""exercise"" (not just sex, but helps) it can atrophy. Massage increases blood flow to the pelvic floor, increases vaginal moisture, may boost your libido, prevents shortening of the canal and prevents thinning and narrowing of the walls.

I know this might be a difficult thing for you to participate in. But, I will try to make you feel as comfortable as possible by keeping the setting and atmosphere as professional as possible. You will need to prepare yourself for the massage by being as relaxed as possible. The session will start with some deep breathing exercises to help you relax. I do not expect anything in return, except your feedback of the massage experience.

I cannot host. The massage must be done in your home. I will not travel out of the local Lacey/Olympia/Dupont/Tumwater area. An open space of approximately 10 by 8 feet must be available (in your home) to set up the table. I will bring the massage table. You must provide a set of twin sheets and pillowcase for the table. You must provide the lubricant of your choice. If your home is not an option and you would like to do the massage in a motel room, you must pay for the room.

Please, serious inquires only. No flakes, no games and no BS. I won't put up with it. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. Thanks for reading.

I am pretty open-minded, love movies, and I am getting back into reading regularly. I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree, where I'm an economics/philosophy/political science major. Running is something I am re-learning to do (I was previously an avid runner), and I am training for a couple 5Ks. I savor the experience of food, especially Thai, where I cannot resist a good plate of pad see ew or pad kee mao. I'm learning to cook and I like comic books, so I have a few geeky moments.

I enjoy witty banter, have hobbies, and genuinely ask questions, so conversation will never be short.

PLEASE be a reliable person who follows through after emailing. Include where you are (city/neighborhood), a bit about your personality and interests, and days/time windows you're generally available to socialize. PLEASE ATTACHED paragraph below.

Do you love nature and getting out into it? Art and music? Let's meet at a cafe for a conversation or get out for a park walk and chat on a good weather day and go from there.

People who are adventurous, will try new things and are curious about life in general are my favorite types of friends. My interests include almost anything that's outdoors in decent weather - good walks and hikes; having a good conversation; musical events; good movies, plants/gardening and public gardens and other cultures. 

Indoor pursuits like conversation over coffee, museums, dinner, talks, hearing music of many types and the like are great when the weather may not be cooperative. I'm a non-smoker (you too, please) and occasionally have a wine or drink. We don't need any of this to have a good time, however. 

I'm a truly good person, have a sense of humor, and am a good friend who remembers birthdays, pays attention to what friends say. I'm also an empathetic person who will help friends in whatever way I can whenever I can. I'm reliable and look for other people who are too, as well as people who are kind, good people who have most of those qualities. Nobody is perfect, of course.

Otherwise, I look forward to hearing from you soon! [Sorry, not looking to meet married people or couples. It doesn't generally work out that well.]

Things that I like to do: I love live shows of all kinds (plays, comedy, opera, concerts, restaurants with live music, etc.), science (especially archaeology, and astronomy), museums, the beach, Sunday afternoon trips, cozy warm snuggling by the fire, good wine, ethnic restaurants and dancing. Hoping to spend some of the winter months in Hawaii or Arizona in three years when I retire. Want to visit Egypt and Italy, and would love to explore the U.S. in an RV someday (I especially love the Southwest). I am happy, secure and independent. I love going out with my friends and won't give that up, but miss the companionship and affection of a man. Most importantly, we both love to laugh! If you think you want to try to make me laugh, tell me something about yourself and send me a photo. I will send you a photo and more about myself, if I think there will be a connection. PLEASE no drugs, no alcoholics, no diseases, no smoking and have employment or a secure retirement.

Hi, thanks for reading my ad. E mail me if you'd like a guys point of view on whats going on in your relationship , if you would like to know what a guy you know is thinking or if you'd just like to know why guys do what they do. We aren't that complicated but I guess sometimes women try to figure men out using their logic when we (men) think in an entirely different way. I would love to help you out and at least give you some ideas on what your guy is thinking. This is just me giving you my thoughts and advice nothing more. I don't even live in your town and i wont be bugging you to meet or a date or anything like that. Take care

My interests include almost anything that's outdoors in decent weather - good walks and hikes; having a good conversation; musical events; good movies, plants/gardening and public gardens; little road trips, and lifelong learning about all types of things including other cultures. Indoor pursuits like conversation over coffee, museums, dinner, talks, hearing music of many types and the like are great when the weather may not be cooperative. I'm hoping you share some of those interests and also want to meet someone who will share some of your unique interests and offers mutual support. I'm a non-smoker (you too, please) and occasionally have a wine or drink. We don't need any of this to have a good time, however. 

I'm a truly good person, have a sense of humor, and am a good friend who remembers birthdays, pays attention to what friends say, and tells them about news or activities I think will interest them. I'm also an empathetic person who will help friends in whatever way I can whenever I can. I'm intelligent, but not intellectual, have a spiritual side but am not religious. (No proselytizers, please) I'm reliable and look for other people who are too, as well as people who are kind, good people who have most of those qualities. Nobody is perfect, of course.

PLEASE NOTE: Please email and include where you are (city/neighborhood), a bit about your personality and interests, and days/time windows you're generally available to socialize. Please be close to the boomer age range and in the areas posted in the first paragraph above. If you'd like to send along your number in addition to a self-description to shortcut things, you can definitely trust me with it. 

If you're fit enough to get out for at least brisk walks, that would be great. I'm fairly fit for this age. I was born elsewhere, have been in the Northwest more than half a lifetime and have interest in meeting people from everywhere. If you're overly concerned with superficiality over substance, we very likely would not be compatible. Otherwise, I look forward to hearing from you soon! [Sorry, not looking to meet married people or couples. It doesn't generally work out that well.]

Hi. So this is kinda like an all time low posting here to connect with someone lol. I thought I'd just try anyway to see what the responses would be like. I don't really use craigslist for dating but figure what the hell. I don't get out much and so I guess it would be nice to kinda meet someone "" electronically"" lol. I am a down to earth, chill and funny kind of person. I don't take life too serious but I do have things going for myself. I own my own home, work hard and have a decent car :). I love movies, books, music, any kind of sports except for baseball. Don't ask why just watch and you'll see for yourself. Anyway, I may just leave it at that. I don't know what to really expect but I am guessing a few replies. My only thing is please don't be a smoker or a heavy drinker. Huge turn off for me and if you are then no disrespect but we won't even come close to being close friends. I just don't like that image and I feel that everyone should be smart by now not to smoke. Have a good day and maybe we'll chat?

Hi and thanks for reading. You must be somewhat interested since you clicked on this :). I am single now for about 6 months and I am looking to get back into meeting and seeing where things go again. I am a busy guy and don't get a lot of chances to go out so I figure why not try this and see anyone responds. I am in a good position in my life right now as far as job, house and friends. However, it's nice to have someone special around and have someone to go out with/share all that. My main turn off is probably going to be you being a smoker. I just think it's nasty and I really don't want to be around that. No offense. I don't discriminate hehe. I am looking for someone fun, creative and real. I like to have nice long conversation over coffee and do things that regular people do I guess. I am into a lot of things but won't mention them here because then you'll know everything there is to know about me lol. That is not the point here. Anyway, please be cool, nice, in somewhat decent shape since I am fit. I'd like to know that you take care of your body and that you are somewhat active as well. A huge plus if you like sports. Anyway, I am not doing much tonight just kinda hanging out. Let me know if you'd like to chat. I am 27 btw!

I have no one. No friends. No family. Ive always only had a few close people in my life at a time but now I'm at a point where those friendships have ended and now I have no one. I am only looking for a friend who is in the same boat and barely has anyone in their life as well. I am not looking for your pity, I am not looking for a group of girls to be friends with. I am generally a pretty shy and reserved girl who doesnt like crowds of people, and really I dont like many people at all. Its hard for me to make friends. I have social anxiety. I just want to find one or two best GIRL friends. I want to be your #1 person where we do everything together like best friends do. I know what I want out of life but i'm not really on the right track right now and could use some motivation and/or company. I'm up for doing whatever with the right friend, except for going to bars/clubs/parties/drugs/sex, etc. One of my main goals is to travel. Please be a GIRL, 18-30 yrs old, and in the same boat as me.

Hello!

First off I am 29, very happily married, and would never change or hurt that, but I really enjoy getting to know new people, that are okay keeping it platonic, or risking any harm to anyone's relationship. I am also from Texas, and enjoy getting to know people from other areas as it removes the pressure to meet if there is a connection, and keep relationships safe. 

I work from home most days, which also means I don't do much on those days, and it would be great to have someone new to get to know and share things with. I'm very open minded, goofy, extremely laid back, I don't judge, I'm allergic to drama, I can be really sarcastic but I know when to turn it off, easy to talk to, and I've had an interesting and unique life so far, so I think I have quite a few interesting things/stories to share. I also have a bit of a dirty mind, and might throw a ""that's what she said"" into a conversation at some point. I am also a major night owl, so if you are too, even better!

I am looking for someone who is: intelligent, funny, witty, understands sarcasm, open minded, non-judgemental, dirty minded, drama free (although venting is allowed), easy to talk with, and just fun. 

Again not looking to meet or change anyone's relationship, just looking for fun conversations to get through the day or night. 

Hope you are having a great day and I'm looking forward to chatting with you!

We live in Portland, but I've accepted a job in South Park, and I am looking to meet people, get to know South & West Seattle, & scout a place for my fam to join me, come June. I keep bees, chickens & fruit trees at our home here in Portland, and I am passionate about eating good food, eclectic music, healthy living & my kids.

We met playing Ultimate frisbee and love all manner of outdoor adventure, we'd enjoy introducing the kiddos to more climbing indoor & out. I was a stay@home parent for four years we have a van, but prefer a lifestyle where we go weeks not using it for kid transport. I am in the marine field & mama is in the birthing arts. In the summer, we line dry our laundry, picnic and find water to recreate on. We buy food in bulk and try to DIY everything at least once. I soak/sprout, ferment and dehydrate foods. The kids and I are vegetarian, I like to read about dietary & health topics, and we aspire to sustainable Traditional/SCD/Whole30 cuisine at home.

We'd love another ""larger"" fam to hang with who has similar life pursuits in S/SW Seattle. I am also looking for a place to stay between 27th/Mar and end of May, if you know of a temp rental, see my cl ad# 5481106589

As time goes I feel as if I will never have a best friend because I never have the time to have only one friend to share life with while laughing about dumb things or going out to watch a movie or even a casual ""date"" with. Saying this doesn't mean I don't have friends because I do, I have a lot of friends but not a best friend for sometime now. I been so consumed with school and work worrying about my future I forgot to live in the present. I been putting friends aside for the longest time. I get along with girls the best and having a girl best friend does not mean I want sex. No just someone that can grow on me and share our time together as friends I'm not in a rush to be in relationship but as time goes who knows.

I'm going to keep this pretty short and to the point. I want to become someone's slave. I want to work for someone, live with them and have them keep all the money I earn. If they want to keep me at home, I hope they would have me working full time at their house doing anything and everything they want me to do. I don't want to be a submissive, I want to be a slave, completely and permanently owned.

Hi. I am what you would call a recluse. I do not have any friends so here I am looking to make some. I am happily married and do not want anyone who thinks that they can make me cheat on him. Not going to happen.


I will insert a photo. Looking for men, women, straight, gay, does not matter. Just looking for people I can go out with, see movies, yadda yadda yadda.

Do you feel a sense of masculinity/manliness/empowerment when you go shirtless? I'm not looking for anything linked to sex, it's the excitement of shirtless in itself.

So here's the thing: I am trying to get out into the world as much as possible. My close friends moved away to different parts of the country, and the ones in the area have been so busy with their own lives. I too have been kept busy with work and school, but things are beginning to settle, and I have a feeling that it would be nice to meet new people. Who does not like making new friends?

I am pretty open-minded, love movies, and I am getting back into reading regularly. I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree, where I'm an economics/philosophy/political science major. Running is something I am re-learning to do (I was previously an avid runner), and I am training for a couple 5Ks. I savor the experience of food, especially Thai, where I cannot resist a good plate of pad see ew or pad kee mao. I'm learning to cook and I like comic books, so I have a few geeky moments.

I enjoy witty banter, have hobbies, and genuinely ask questions, so conversation will never be short.

I honestly can't think of a good title, so if you read through this and it's not for you, please- no emails about how I wasted your time. 

I'll try my best to describe what I'd like, but I think the right person will understand. First of all, I""m not looking to meet. Where I am is not particularly relevant, but let's just say it's way too far for a meeting, even if I was interested. Basically, I'm looking for conversations that are outside our daily lives, the stuff you wouldn't normally voice out loud. This encompasses so many things, which I'm not going to list, but let's just say I speak my mind, No topic is off limits or ""too soon"" if it's funny. 

For the most part, I miss laughing. I had an on-line friend for about two years, and we used to have a lot of these weird conversations- and about our daily lives too- but I mostly miss those random, uninhibited thoughts that showed me who he really was. That's my take on it anyway- most of what we show the world on a daily basis is the version of ""us"" that is socially acceptable. I'd like to find someone who accepts me even if it doesn't always sound safe or sane. I'd like to do the same for you.

If you think this is for you, please feel free to introduce yourself, and include the same stats I've listed about myself in this ad. Oh, two things: 1) Please be a decent writer, who will write more than two sentences of ""text speak"". I will not respond to one- two line emails, or retarded questions like ""Are you real?""; 2) Please have time to write more than once in a blue moon. I think once a day is reasonable, given all the responsibilities we have at home and work. It could be more on some days, but if you expect frequent emails every day, I'm not the one.

Finally, please don't be offended if I don't respond. It's not personal, it's Craigslist. In any case, thank you for taking the time to read my ad.

I moved here last year and would like to meet some people--possible new friends. I am easy to be with and talk to---also fun.

I enjoy hiking out in nature, walking anywhere, reading, movies, cafes--coffee and tea---want to meet for a coffee?, lunches out--want to meet for lunch?, dinners out, yoga, healthy eating, music, concerts, poetry.
I have a degree in communications and have been reading recently about the importance and value of relationships and friendships. I think many today don't enjoy either enough. And so, would you like to meet and / or do something together? I'm open and available.

So yeah, seeking a metal/rocker chick. Don't really care what you look like as long as you like the music and would love to check out the local venues and concerts with me. I can be wild -love moshing and raves but don't look like it and can act quite normal when I choose. My only requirement beyond loving the music is being fun -you don't have to be Five Finger Death Punch energetic or whatnot ..you can be Nirvana or whatever low key mellow. I myself love all kinds of tempo and get moved by the music and fellow attendees. So it's not like I'll thrash to Pink Floyd lol ...I really want to check out Laser Floyd in fact. Anyway hit me up if you like metal and/or rock or vice versa. I'm looking to go to Sabbath in September.

Hey there, Im really finicky with people in general, I literally talk to two people in person in my life, my gf and best friend. I keep trying to make a second friend but its really hard for me. I hate most people, I dont get along with them nor care for more friends really, but its hard feeling so shut off from the world sometimes. I also seem to attract a lot of sociopathic people, And im extremly sick of them, so if youve been called one, please dont bother me. Ive tried having compassion for them because thats considered a disorder, but im done doing that and feeling bad for people who get off on fucking other peoples lives over, my empathy is far better used on people who arent the REASON the world is so fucked up I dont even leave my house unless I have to. 

Anyways, I tend to rant about the shit world a lot, I live with chronic illness- I have a connective tissue disorder so some days are harder to get around then others, but I can do cool tricks like the bendy pics in this post ha. Also have schizoaffective disorder which makes me a bit extra paranoid of people and reclusive. Im an artist.. I feel like Im writing an ad for a dog with issues or somehting ha. I dont know how to communicate with people on the ""socially acceptable level"" The whole hi how are you?- oh Fine you? - I hate idle chatter and how we all just go through these shit fucking motions in life, never really tapping into eachother on a human being level. Im not a robot, and I feel like nearly every person I talk to in public are just empty shells on autopilot, its creepy and reminds me why I almost never bother to seek any other people in my life out. 
Anywhat, preferably Id like someone around my age- though I usually get along with way older people a ton better, I think id be more nervous to met someone whos like 70 online ha. In person I see to get along with them better then most shit nose young people. I may be eccentric and look like that type of person, but Ive been told by even my own family that Im like an old man about things. Ha and then I even sometimes use a walker hahaha, Im not your average person lets just say.

I have posted on here a couple of times before just looking to meet someone new. I lead a pretty busy life between work and being a single dad to a teenage daughter. This makes it difficult to get out and meet anyone new so I thought I would try this. As I said looking for just friends which is why I am posting here. I know that I can be a little shy at first, but I open up pretty easily once I get to know someone. I am looking for someone who just likes to tLk whether it be email or text or getting together for a coffee or drink. Maybe grab a movie every once in a while or just get together to talk about what's going on and life in general. If this sounds interesting I look forward to hearing from you.

I'd like to meet a nice lady and I mean LADY who likes to chat over coffee or a glass of wine in the evenings a couple of times a week. I'm am extremely busy person and rarely have time to meet people. On occasion I'm able to leave work early and I find myself not tired enough to go to bed so I drive around looking for something exciting to do but its never fun when you are alone. I have absolutely no interest in sex or marriage but a good friend to unload the daily drama. Just someone to chat with. I like going to dinner, movies, sharing a bottle of wine, and if not too tired a dance or two isn't out of the question. I enjoy art in almost every form, politics but don't like to bring it up unless we are 100% compatible in that department. I've done quite a bit of travelling , usually off the beaten path with little funds so I have a bunch of anecdotes we can share. I'm a good listener and enjoy hearing others play their tape. So if this is something that piques your curiosity drop me a line. Again NOT interested in sex, not gay either but I just have to know someone very well before anything happens or at least year from the time we meet. 

Adios!

Hello there :) I've tried this a few times, but after the initial meeting, it kinda fizzles out. Besides a few girls, but they are so busy with their own lives, I don't see them as often as I'd like. (I totally appreciate them though, they are super awesome). But lately I have been super lonely. I have always had a hard time keeping friends. Even in childhood. I just want someone to call my best friend (Besides the boyfriend). Someone who I can just chill with or have a shoulder to cry on or talk about boy problems or whatever. Anyway, below I will post some information about myself. 

*I am 27, almost 28.
*Have worked in childcare since I was 13. 
*I have a boyfriend. We have been together for almost 3 years. And we do live together. 
*Huge nerds.
*Between the 2 of us we have Vita, PSP, PS2, PS3, PS4, Gameboy Advance SP, DS, Gamecube, Snes, Nes, Wii, XBox 360, Steam Link, and PC. So we love us some games. :)
*Watch shows like The Walking Dead, GoT, X Files, HIMYM, Once upon a time, and so many more shows. The list would never end. 
*Loves me some movies too. I have about 400 dvds and its slowly growing. 
*Huge bookworm. Mainly Young Adult, Science Fiction, Fantasy, Classics, Historical Dramas. 
*We are also wrestling fans. I mainly love the Attitude Era, but I still love it all. (WCW, ECW, WWF/E)
*Love to watch Anime. Again, that list would go on forever. But some of my favorites are Dragon Ball/Z (I pretend GT doesn't exist, I thought it was done poorly), Elfin Lied, Full Metal Alchemist, Sword Art Online, DeathNote, Future Diary, Welcome to the NHK, and so many more. 
Just an all around nerd :)

So if you'd like to chat, just email me. 

Not sure what else to say. If you think we would connect, let me know. Thank you for reading :) 
To weed out spam, put your favorite anime, book, or musician in the subject. Thank you.

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag drifting through the wind...

But seriously....maybe Katy Perry is onto something. 

Music speaks to me. I've been through a lot in the last couple of years. I'm not ready to date right now and I'm not looking for someone to hook up with. I would like to find a man to talk to and be friends. Hang out with. Eventually maybe we can date if things line up. 

I'm not looking for someone who is married or otherwise unavailable or someone way older than me. I'm 30, so you should be in your 30s too. Children and race don't matter. I would like to find someone that I'm intellectually compatible with that we can talk about real issues and the world but also just laugh about stupid stuff too. 

Send me a picture and tell me something special or unique about yourself.

Hey there,

I moved to Seattle a few months ago and work full time, so I've had trouble meeting anyone to talk to or hang out with. That's my deal. I don't really know anyone here and would like to do something about it, so here I am.

I'm a thirty year old male, but I look younger. Baker by trade. I'd describe myself as kind of shy, but really smart. Friendly, considerate, respectful, caring, adventurous. I have eclectic hobbies. Everything from super nerdy stuff, to the arts, to the outdoors. I like trying new things too.

I'm single, but not looking for a romantic relationship, so I don't feel like it's appropriate to describe myself physically. Suffice to say that I try to take care of myself. I don't really know what I'm looking for in a friend, but I'd say honesty is incredibly important to me. I think I'd like to surround myself with positivity and/or intelligence.

Hit me up. Ask me anything you want, tell me about yourself, whatever. You can always decide that it's not a good fit and I wont be offended. Without that first email we'll never know though, will we?


Have an awesome day either way,

-Dain

Also a pool player where grandma taught me everything I know and enjoy my whiskey and coke, although not an alcoholic. Prefer not to talk to the police dept. on the way home.

Looking for some new friends and fresh perspective. I am 33 years old.I have spent the greater part of the last 10 years in a monogamous relationship. Out of that I gained two awesome kids. I have spent the last 3 years or so clumsily stepping in and out of the dating scene. I have been through my ""manwhore"" stage, my ""I want another long term partner"" stage and now seem to be in a ""JADED"" state. I have come to the conclusion that this will pass although it's going to take some doing on my part.

So, here I am on Craigslist. . . 

I am into Metal Music and play bass in a metal band that gigs often.
Thats not where my musical taste stops but it definately takes up most of the pallet.
I like outdoor activities such as, but not limited to Sking,fishing,hiking,bonfires, bbqs,biking,swimming,floating rivers and just enjoying nature.
I have a ""Moderately inappropriate"" sense of humor. 
I may or may not offend you but one thing is for sure. I speak my mind.
I am no longer the manwhore I once was and I am STD frrrreeeeee.! (Recently tested)

I am not looking for naked pictures or sexting.
I will also not turn either down 
I will not instigate these activities


I am an open book with many blank pages 

Im open to any type of conversation.

I'm here to make friends first off. I guess this is where I brag ""yourself"" well here it goes.

I'm told I'm not hard on the eyes that is if you wear bi-focals and legally blind in one eye.

i'm just a down to earth guy with a corky sense of humor. If you laugh hard when someone trips or you think old people are cool then skip the blah blah ,yada , yada, yada and we should already be chatting. Oh yeah I don't have a criminal record either something everyone should be asking everyone online don't ya think? Lol

I am looking for perhaps a platonic female partner of any age for this. We will see about doing this weekly..one coffee, or massage ;) at a time, but no expectations. I am fun, funny, and down right witty sometimes, I've been told. Also, clean cut, nice, gentle, ddf and ""a genuine great guy"". I can do a great Deep Tissue massage or a wonderful light touch Swedish massage. Reciprocation would be nice, but what ever YOU Like. Its up to you!

You feel your body being spun around, and immediately your face is in your pillows, as your arms are forced behind your back and bound. With his weight on top of you, you can't move. He grabs your hair to lift your head. You open your mouth to scream, but quickly find it stuffed with a ball gag, which is quickly secured at the back of your neck. You feel your panties being yanked down your legs and past your feet.

You lay there, on your stomach, with his weight on your back, holding your down, unable to move. You know he's going to fuck you right here, so you decide to lay motionless in the hope that he will finish quickly and leave. But instead, you feel yourself being lifted from the bed and half-carried, half-dragged over to a desk.

He bends you roughly over the desk, so your feet are still on the ground, your stomach and face are pressed up against the desk and your pussy and ass are hanging in mid-air, waiting for him to take you. You realize, shockingly, that you are wet. Not just a little, but dripping wet. Your brain screams that it doesn't want him inside of you, but at the same time, the rest of your body desperately does. Fortunately, you think, you probably won't have to wait too long for that to happen.

You feel the bindings keeping your wrists behind your back loosen. He roughly grabs your arms and places them over your head. You feel rope tightening around your wrists, and as you test the new bindings, you realize you're attached to the desk now. Moments later, you feel similar bindings around your ankles, spreading your legs wide.

Now strong hands take their place at your hips. You feel pressure against your sopping wet pussy. You take a deep breath, knowing your body is about to be invaded by his hard cock.

. . .Reply with ""What Happens Next"" so I know you're real. Don't forget to include a few pics.

I'm always there for friends, and I've been known to answer the phone in the middle of the night. I'm a great listener and enjoy helping people navigate through tough times and love celebrating the good times. I don't miss events that are important to close friends and sometimes acquaintances. But it seems that things don't always go both ways. I know who the reliable people are and of course they are a high priority, but sometimes I just help too much when maybe I shouldn't.

Of course the obvious answer is to keep being there for people and know when to cut people off. But it it gets old sometimes, right? 

Anyway, tell me what you think. What's on your mind? And if you have something completely unrelated and need to talk, I enjoy listening. I just can't put my number on here because I'd get some strange calls from CL people, I'm sure. And no, I'm not ugly :P

I don't mind hosting, but I'd rather meet somewhere first so we're both sure we're cool with it. Prolly won't be hanging when the wife is home. We pretty much hoard our time together. She don't partake though sadly.

I like to cook(a lot), gaming, movies, riding quad, shooting off few rounds out back. What ever really. I'm super easy going. Hmu if you're interested.

Anything else just ask.

Hi!

I'm a 20 year old female who is new to the area and looking for a (*very*) strictly platonic chess partner! I haven't started school or work here yet and don't know many people. I also know there is a chess club that meets up in Greenlake...but I am without a car at the moment and getting there would be very difficult. Anyway, I'm looking for a male or female around my age, in West Seattle/Alki area, who would be willing to play chess with me a couple days a week. My schedule is extremely flexible and I'm available all the time :). 

I'm also pretty bad at chess. I learned to play only a couple weeks ago, and I got hooked on it :). So if you think you're terrible at chess, or haven't played in awhile, we'd be a perfect match! If you are really good at chess and would want a confidence booster....I can do that for you too! I'm willing to play anyone.

If this sounds interesting to you, email me and we can talk about specifics :)

Hello. As the title says, I'm looking to find someone to pass the time throughout the day chatting about whatever. No hidden motives. I know, I know, all guys say that, but I'm being honest. I will hopefully find someone who is willing to have intelligent and witty conversations, who will ask questions and don't mind me asking questions, who would be able to continue this longer than a few email exchanges, and basically just a fun person to chat with. I don't care what your relationship status, or age as I'm more concerned with what is in your mind and heart. I'm an amazing listener, I will try and make you laugh when you're feeling down, and an all around nice guy.

Hello!

First off I am 29, very happily married, and would never change or hurt that, but I really enjoy getting to know new people, that are okay keeping it platonic, or risking any harm to anyone's relationship. I am also from Texas, and enjoy getting to know people from other areas as it removes the pressure to meet if there is a connection, and keep relationships safe. 

I work from home most days, which also means I don't do much on those days, and it would be great to have someone new to get to know and share things with. I'm very open minded, goofy, extremely laid back, I don't judge, I'm allergic to drama, I can be really sarcastic but I know when to turn it off, easy to talk to, and I've had an interesting and unique life so far, so I think I have quite a few interesting things/stories to share. I also have a bit of a dirty mind, and might throw a ""that's what she said"" into a conversation at some point. I am also a major night owl, so if you are too, even better!

I am looking for someone who is: intelligent, funny, witty, understands sarcasm, open minded, non-judgemental, dirty minded, drama free (although venting is allowed), easy to talk with, and just fun. 

Again not looking to meet or change anyone's relationship, just looking for fun conversations to get through the day or night. 

Hope you are having a great day and I'm looking forward to chatting with you!

I know a young man who has a good heart that made a bad choice, and is now paying the price for it. He has few friends or family that take time to write, and so far in 2 years has gotten 0 counseling from the people that are supposed to be helping him through this. If you have time to write a few letters and feel like you want to make a difference and be an uplifting help to a misguided kind soul, please contact me for more info.

Hello all!

I am a 24 year old fun loving gal who is looking for a friend or a group of friends to go out with and get close to! I want to find someone who is genuinely interested in keeping up a conversation and wants to get together either today or tomorrow for a drink or coffee. Please be 420 friendly and open minded. 

No
Judgemental people
Flakes
Big egos *unless it's tempered with a great sense of humor
Sedentary lifestyles *I like to hike and see pretty sights. 

I'm really hoping to find someone I can go out with all the time and really spend a lot of time with and grow close to. It's been a long time since I've had a close friend and I don't want to continue to go on feeling the way I do now. I know there's someone out there for me and I hope as you're reading this maybe it's you. I look forward to hearing from you!

Thank you for reading. I'll be in the Seattle area on business Thursday through Saturday. Staying near Seatac. Usually have dinner plans...but I'm free the entire time. Would really enjoy meeting someone for dinner and drinks on me. And that's it! We meet at the restaurant and leave separately.

You: over 40, funny, intelligent, loves conversation and interesting

No need to dress up as it will be fairly casual and totally about enjoying great conversation.

I have attached a photo for both safety and because we should be able to recognize each other before we meet. So please attached a photo if interested.

Hello, I'm looking for strictly a gaming buddy.

Nothing relationship wise or sexual.

I have a fiance, I'm just looking for a girl to game with simply because I get along with women better than men.

I play a lot of games. From FPS's to MMO's, MOBA's and RPG's, racing and strategy.

I play mostly on Steam, and Battle.net, some games on Origin from time to time.

I'm (For the most part, and not to sound too full of myself) a pretty competent gamer. I've played some games at the very highest level. I used to stream and do the youtubes as well. I'm wanting to get back into it later this year and rebuild my twitch and youtube channels again.

I play dota 2 (Around 3.5 - 4k mmr usually), league of legends (Ive always gotten gold for my friends every season, but I never care about my account. But most of my friends for league I play with are plat + diamond), HoTS, D3, I used to play WoW and was raid lead for 2 heroic progression guilds, had world rankings on my resto drood, and always ran for server 1st kills and tried for world kills and what not :)

I play CS GO (I was DMG but haven't played in a few months), and much much more. :) I also play Magic (I enjoy white/green decks, and black). Also have Path of Exile, Killing Floor 2, etc.

Just looking for someone to play with, you don't have to be amazing. But it would be nice if you knew your way around the basics.

I'm also extremely nerdy. I'm great with computers, networking (Having trouble with your DMZ and QOS/COS? Or are you having trouble federating and can't contact anyone out of your business in lync? Easy peasey), hardware or software as well.

Also just some more info about me. I don't drink, do drugs or smoke. I'm pretty friendly, I'm also pretty conservative. 

Blah blah blah, lots of stuff.

I'm a tech professional with high drive in a top tech company in the area. I'll launch my/our new tech business over the next 1 year. I'd like to enter the trillion dollar fin-tech industry, where I'd like to leverage technology to build no-nonsense, convenient, and fast product/service. As a consumer/customer of this industry, I have pain points, and I know there are millions of others who feel the same. So, I'd like to solve problems of millions of consumers like me and as a result ...

For the next 6-18 months, I'll develop this product side by side of my current job. If you are employed right now, you can do the same.

For a successful business, I believe the partners need to complement each other. I'm good with numbers, plus I can build very good technological solution, but I lack background in finance, banking, and accounting. So, my ideal partner will be someone who is experienced in this industry, either with corporate customers, or individual consumers. You will be the face of the business as well, and I'll manage the back-end solution and product. You'll need to shape the product/service as well, because I know HOW, but I need you to tell me WHAT to do and not to do.

This is not a get rich easy scheme or anything. This is the get rich quick with hard work based on a solid product or service, by identifying a customer need and fulfilling it with exceptional quality, customer service, and superb marketing, and branding, and scaling it for millions of people leveraging technology. If you have the finance/accounting background you should be able to easily envision how rich can you get.

I'm also in corporate employee at this moment. Both you and I know that corporate job will award you with 1-2% raise on top of your 50-150K per year salary, for your hard work of 70 hours/week. So, I'd like us to channel the energy to our own venture which can easily earn 50-150K per month.

I'm also NOT looking for any investment (not even a single penny) from your part. Just bring in your charisma, experience, expertise, high drive, passion, hunger, desire, and of course humor :)

I look forward to hearing from you :)

Cheers!

My name's Myfi! 

I'm a bit afraid of meeting new people, but I'm very friendly once I'm given the chance to get comfortable, I love to bake (and I will shunt many food-gifts upon you if you'll let me), I love tea , movies and animals(this includes reptiles. I own two. Be not afraid). 

I am generally relatively low-energy due to being out of shape and various other reasons, but if you have ideas for things to do I'm up for a fair amount of things! I am very blunt and fairly snarky, but I am an excellent listener and if you need someone to talk to about ANYTHING, I will sit and be a shoulder to lean on and will give generally sage advice upon being asked. I do have a long-term dedicated partner and we tend to spend our weekends together, so all of my free time is during the day (8am to 4pm) during the week. I also have the added benefit of having an adorable puppy who is SUPER high-energy and looking for routine playmates!

I do not drive, so relative closeness or a willingness to drive to me is wonderful, though I am equally content to make phone-friends or online friends! 

I'm not christian or religious and as long as you don't try to convert me I have no issues!
I am very libertarian and pro gun, so gun control supporters probably shouldn't apply. I'm incredibly prickly about being able to protect myself and equalize the playing field, as weak as I am physically.
I love all music except for rap. When I say all music, I mean everything from rock to metal to electronic to classical and opera to jazz and swing to disney music. As long as it's not Let It Go we'll get along great. I'm a bit of a budding audiophile as well!

I have a massive appreciation of nature which is a little ironic being that I've not been able to get out in it anywhere near as much as I'd like. 

The only thing I partake of to any degree is alcohol, and I'm insanely picky about it. I don't particularly have issues with anything you may or may not do, with the preference that if it's something illicit you not do it around me! I'm fine with pot smokers as well, but I ask it not be smoked around me(at least in an area where I would get the smell on me) as my partner is very sensitive and it would cause him to have severe nosebleeds :)

I'm told that I am a very giving and wonderful friend by what few I have scattered across the states and other countries! I'm fine with platonic snuggles and the like if and once you are(because who doesn't like to dogpile during movies, right? Especially when there's a cute pup!)

I mostly dream of raising tons of adorable baby animals, from reptiles to birds to mammals to insects! I am also obsessed with aircraft and many of the other Nicer Things With Engines that exist. Physics is good shit.

I'm a big movie goer, but I hate the fact that if the movie is bad, I can't turn to the person beside me and quietly berate it, or to pretend the tear in my eye is from where a piece of popcorn that miraculously hit me in the eye. I'm also very creative. I write. I have a book self-published on Amazon, I write poetry, like to sing etc, and would like to find someone to share my creative spirit with.

Please do not contact me if you have or want a kid, I have tried getting along with people who have or want kids my age before and it just doesn't work. Also please don't contact me if you smoke cigarettes, it is a disgusting habit and you smell nasty. 

I like nature and guinea pigs. My favorite band is Blood on the Dance Floor, no I am not an extreme fan and I will not threaten to kill you or say you are a horrible person if you do not like them. 

I just recently started getting into Crown The Empire, I like Bart Baker and nature music. My music taste can be all over the place but I will not listen to religious Music, Folk Music or music where the singer is screaming to the point that I have to guess what they are saying so most screamo/metal lol

I can be very talkative, but in person I am not extremely talkative. I am autistic, so I do not like people touching me very much. Even a handshake makes me uncomfortable. Unless you are put on to my list of people I am comfortable with having physical contact with, I probably won't want much physical contact. It's part of being autistic.

When I'm not in school, I try to be in the gym or I am out running errands. I like to draw, color, swim, walk and lift weights with my lower body.

I am a minimalist, I have slight obsessive compulsive disorder and I am horrible at washing dishes. I like long naps and procrastinating on the weekend. I also love Supernatural.

I love rodents, some reptiles and horses. Guinea pigs are my favorite animal. I don't really like cats but I can kind of get along with them.

You can add me on Facebook @dahvie hammons (creamsicle). My profile picture is a headshot of a orange, cream and black colored Fox dragon. 

Please do not add me if you do not intend to speak with me. Or if you don't intend to talk very much, I don't want to add people who will just collect dust on my friend list.

Oh, please don't contact me if you are religious, why make fun of God all the time, and I generally feel uncomfortable around religious people. I support abortions and Bernie Sanders. 

It would be really great to find another vegan or at least vegetarian in the area. Not a requirement at all but it would be great to actually find someone I can relate with on a different level.

I did mention I was disabled, I am not wheelchair-bound, I have autism and Whiplash in my back and neck. I can definitely walk for about an hour before I get tired.

Please be under the age of 30.

So I work 6 days a week from 4am to 11pm. Off on Monday's only. Don't have much of a life as you can imagine. I've been doing this for so long that I've forgotten what it was to sit and chat with a lady. Yes what I'm looking for is a LADY, no I'm not interested in sex just harmless chat over coffee, dinner or a glass of wine. Some days I get lucky and can leave work early, and it usually happens when I'm anxious about something and needing someone to talk to. I've noticed that because of my schedule that over the years I've lost all of my friends and can't find anyone to chat with. This makes life very lonely. 

A bit about myself, I'm a workaholic as you probably figured out. I'm well traveled and love the arts. I'm 48 and I'm not much of an athlete but I'm 6' tall and 198 lbs. , I don't think I'm overweight but I'm not a twig either. I think they call it HWP on CL. So if you are interested in some evening chat, maybe a movie, dinner, wine, coffee or the like, drop me a line. BTW anything we do is my treat. It's a cultural thing so don't think because I pick up the check I want anything more than a nice evening with a nice lady. I don't care how old you are just be between 25 and 55.

Let's just say, if I knew what I was really looking for, maybe I wouldn't be looking for it here. 

With that out of the way, for now I'd like to find someone interested in chatting via e-mail, with the potential to move over to Kik. Not looking to trade phone numbers, pictures, or personal e-mails right off the bat. I'm not in Seattle, so the possibility of meeting up is pretty slim.

I'm interested in things that will keep the conversation moving. I like the standard stuff: movies, music, television, travel. I like to read, but don't do it much. If I'm gaming, it's more likely to be retro (Sorry, UNO, Pictionary, Balderdash) than current (Halo, Bioshock, WoW - that's still a thing, right?). Yes, I'm in my 30s and yes, I still love the 80s. (Meaning the decade...not specifically octogenarians.)

I enjoy writing. I enjoy flirting. I enjoy analyzing other people's problems more than my own. If you've got a dirty mind, that makes two of us.

I'd prefer chatting with men 30-50 who have a strong grasp on grammar and the English language (sorry, it's the only language in which I am fluent), who aren't going to push for pics or cam, who have a versatile sense of humor, and who are creative...but not afraid of science and math. (Okay, a little afraid of math is understandable.) I'm willing to be flexible on some of those things more than others.

If you're still reading this and feel like striking up a conversation, go ahead! Just put your name (or whatever you want me to call you) and your age in the subject so I know you're at least a highly functional A.I.

P.S. I'm not actually sleepless. If I don't reply to you immediately, I might be passed out somewhere. Oh, and if you're someone who has a hang-up about talking to chicks who may (or may not, I don't know how much pizza you eat) weigh more than you, don't bother. I am one of those ""BBW"" gals.

Hello CL,

I just moved to the Seattle area last month and looking for a work out partner/friend. I have a gym membership at Planet Fitness. (I know it sucks, but it's the closest to my home and free guest so you don't have to pay for the membership) I've been working out for a few months and lost a couple pounds but with moving and the chaos of finding a job I lost motivation to go work out. I want someone who has goals and knows what they are doing. (you don't have to be a pro or a personal trainer) I would prefer someone who isn't afraid to lift weights and get sweaty. Hopefully someone around 20-27 years old. I don't want to look like someones mother or a sugar baby. 

About me:
23 yr old from California. Lesbian. (I won't hit on you so don't worry.) I am tech savvy and love to play video games. I'm pretty nerdy you can say since I also like anime and cosplay. I enjoy being outside and reading. I'm pretty easy going. (or at least I think so) I can be shy at first but once the ice is broken it's smooth sailing. I have a good sense of humor. I am 420 friendly but I don't smoke. I will go out a drink here and there.
Hopefully we can become friends and hang out after. 

If you think this is you, send me a message. I will send pictures if I feel comfortable enough talking to you before we meet.

I am looking to find a nice gal who perhaps we can develop a special friendship, talktime or weekly walks, and maybe, needs an amazing massage. It would be a bonus for me-if you are trained professionally in massage or have some ongoing experience I would be able to enjoy too. I can bring my portable massage table and sheets and you supply a small, cozy room, oils and lotion, or i can. A little about me; I'm told i look tall & handsome, and broadshouldered, w a cleancut appearance. I also feel and look great and have nice ""feet"" and a nice V shaped upper body, and attributes;(smooth/soft hands) I workout regularly, about 3x a week, and eat pretty well to stay hwp. I am looking for perhaps a platonic female partner of any age for this. We will see about doing this weekly..one coffee, or massage ;) at a time, but no expectations. I am fun, funny, and down right witty sometimes, I've been told. Also, clean cut, nice, gentle, ddf and ""a genuine great guy"". I can do a great Deep Tissue massage or a wonderful light touch Swedish massage. Reciprocation would be nice, but what ever YOU Like. Its up to you! If your personable, nice, nice looking ; ) hwp and ddf, fun and exciting(like me ; ) perhaps, open to a new friend, and willing to let go a bit, let me know! Please send a picture or 3 ;) ideally, and a bit about you. Put ur favorite drink in subject line! NO SPAM - THANKS for reading and responding!

Let's get together and have our own 'photoshoot'. We'll just go out and have fun for a few hours or a day.

We could travel around, rivers, ocean, near a boat or in a City art galleries, coffee shops... whatever we're interested in. We could even bring a few pieces of clothing to change it up a bit.

Thanks!

You are a woman, in Washington, looking for friends, but scared or embarrassed to post on Craigslist even though it sort of seems like the final option. 
You thought about answering an ad on Craigslist, but it seemed so awkward or you started to doubt that it really meant platonic...
You are a reasonably stable person. You are probably 24-49, definitely an adult. You know where you are sleeping tonight and who with even if that's your cat/dog/chimp.
Maybe you are in college, maybe you are an artist, maybe you are a SAHM or you might have a job
9-5/M-F...
Whatever the rest of your life looks like, there's some vacancies in the friends department. Probably especially the Best Friends department. Whether you relocated or outgrew your High School friends or had to break unhealthy connections...
NOW you are in the mood for that one friend who smiles when she sees you coming or the little group that will throw you a birthday party and you won't mind because they know how to do it for you.
So,

Hello.

I'm James. My friends call me James. . . feel free to call me James if you'd like.

I want to find a friend or two to hang out with!

I'm Single, artist, well-educated, well-traveled, adventurous, Liberal, non-racist, no drugs, no smoking.

⚫ Chatting at a local coffee shop?
⚫ Watching a movie?
⚫ Just hanging out having random conversations?
⚫ Going for a walk (mile or two?)
⚫ Going for a hike?
⚫ Exploring a local City?
⚫ Head off to the Ocean?
⚫ A motorcycle ride (I have a spare helmet)

Platonic. I just find I get along better with women them most men. Maybe I'll place an ad for gay men too... they don't seem to have the Testosterone poisoning that straight men do.

PLEASE DON'T RESPOND UNLESS YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT FINDING A NEW PLATONIC FRIEND. 


That being said, I am a 34 y/o lesbian, a working mom, with 2 kids, a wife and 3 adorable dogs at home. I'm pretty laid back, open, honest and love to laugh. I love the Seahawks, movies, good friends and good times, travel, karaoke, shopping...etc

You should be around my age unless you're an extremely mature younger person, and actually have time to hang out. (Which means you don't live 20+ miles away unless you're one of those people who doesn't mind the drive. I am NOT that person lol) The problem I have with current friends is that I almost never see them and my very best friends don't live close anymore. 
If I say something to you that may sound insignificant to any Joe Schmoe, but is a big deal to me, I want someone who will totally get the significance and respond appropriately.
That's not asking for much, right?
I want to share my thoughts, my retarded jokes, my hopes, my fears and all that other bestie stuff without judgement. Let's bitch about the parts of life that suck over a glass of wine...or shots of tequila, whatever seems appropriate at the time.
I want to be family we got to choose for ourselves.

Fair Warning:
I don't let people in right off the bat, I have PTSD and a little bit of social anxiety, I'm kinda shy and I prefer to email or text until I get comfortable and think a friendship would work before meeting in person. But if you can be patient and bear with me, it could be totally worth the wait.

Bonus points- 
You have minimal drama
You're LGBT (I could REALLY use more gay friends!)
Seahawks fan
420 doesn't bother you 
You're a parent
You're awesome :)
None of these are deal breakers, except the awesome part ;)

If you think we might be a good fit feel free to hit me up!
Your pic gets mine, but it's really not that big of a deal.

Hello CL,

I just moved to the Seattle area last month and looking for a work out partner/friend. I have a gym membership at Planet Fitness. (I know it sucks, but it's the closest to my home and free guest so you don't have to pay for the membership) I've been working out for a few months and lost a couple pounds but with moving and the chaos of finding a job I lost motivation to go work out. I want someone who has goals and knows what they are doing. (you don't have to be a pro or a personal trainer) I would prefer someone who isn't afraid to lift weights and get sweaty. Hopefully someone around 20-27 years old. I don't want to look like someones mother or a sugar baby. 

About me:
23 yr old from California. Lesbian. (I won't hit on you so don't worry.) I am tech savvy and love to play video games. I'm pretty nerdy you can say since I also like anime and cosplay. I enjoy being outside and reading. I'm pretty easy going. (or at least I think so) I can be shy at first but once the ice is broken it's smooth sailing. I have a good sense of humor. I am 420 friendly but I don't smoke. I will go out a drink here and there.
Hopefully we can become friends and hang out after. 

If you think this is you, send me a message. I will send pictures if I feel comfortable enough talking to you before we meet.

Greetings Fellow Craiglister...

Like most of us this time of year, I am focused on shedding a few pounds and making a few new friends. I would like to lose 30lbs and it is always easier with a buddy. More importantly though, I would love to meet new friend or 2 for brunches, craft time, hanging out at the beach, happy hour, wine tasting, sharing, caring, camaraderie. 

A little bit about me: I am 31, lives with my boyfriend in Ballard, no kids, flexible working schedule, Gym membership at Olympic Athletic Club, walk a monthly 5K, love to cook, Seahawks Fan. 

A little bit about you: Friendship goes both ways, please don't be flakey or unavailable. I am looking for someone who would like to get together weekly, has similar interests and enjoys the give and take of a genuine friend. 

Thank you for checking out my ad, I look forward to hear from you :)

My job doesn't make me enough money to pay for all the needed things, plus everything for school and I'm working on getting another one. But in the meantime, I have to pay these fees or I won't be able to continue in the classes.

If you or someone you know, would be willing to help out a little bit? If they have work I could do to earn it, or I can pay it back and I have ways I can ensure that. It's really important/needed and I would so greatly approximate the help. 

Ps, I'm not some drug seeker asking for drug money like some other people on here.

Realization has came; I need higher quality friends. 

It's easy for me to go out to a venue at night, and meet some cool new people, but lately, I haven't found the time for it, meaning I'm more focused on making money than meeting potentially cool new people. 

Also, I don't like the chaos of some night venues (aka Capitol Hill), and running into some of the frequent, up tight, scarcity ridden, basic bitch/basic dude, jack holes. I made that up. Jack holes, sounds like Asshole, but I subconsciously combined Jackass and Asshole, since there's plenty of that to go around. 

Close to a decade back (7 years ago or so), I used Strictly Platonic and only one straight guy replied to me, and he kept rambling about Julius Caesar and how being a public servant was a privilege and if enemies are at the gate, it's great to serve and protect people. Then my memory hit, he's using lines from the motherfucking Batman Dark Knight Joker movie, preaching it like its his own belief, when dude hasn't even seen war. Dude must've really loved Harvey Dent. 

-_-

I'm not opposed to being friends with gay dudes, but to be honest, I don't feel like I have much in common with them, but more so with straight dudes. And to be fair, I probably have more in common with straight/lesbian women than I do with gay dudes, despite opposite gender positioning. 

Let's cut to the chase, I've been weighing on reasons why tonight I need to have less contact with another friend and the pros of not talking to him outweigh the cons, so I made the decision to only hit the dude up maybe once every 3-4 weeks. Yes, it's that bad.

Then it made me realize what sort of people I want in my life and me knowing what I have to offer.
So here's the damn list:

Future Friend Reference Qualifications:

Has to be socially attuned, this means they know how one dresses shows social intelligence, which means not dressing like a retard/full blown D&D nerd. 



Has to not be BASIC aka Basic Bitch, or AKA Basic Bro, good redeeming qualities that differentiate him/her from the rest of the pack. I don't care to hear about your sorority/frat pack shit or mindless chatter. I want something deeper and meaningful, existential and long term goals for both of us that makes us more than what we currently are. 



Exemplify The Quality of Their Gender/Sex. --- If you're a woman that means being feminine and can cook a mean breakfast, or can turn the on switch when necessary to be feminine such as speaking smoothly and eloquently. And if a man, then being masculine, knowing when it's time to be a man's man, like fixing your flat tire, shooting guns/bows with arrows/hunting or switching out the damn car battery. 



Has To Know/Be Aware of Red Pill Truth/Reality/Social Constructs (especially race/class/etc.) & Benefit of the Nuclear Family Structure. - You know third wave feminism is a construct designed for first world privileged people to be even more privileged. As a person of color, it's the next progression of privilege to another party when a certain party already has privilege because of them being the dominant race in America. 

Also it helps if you know the current cultural landscape/history of colored folks and their struggles, from Black to Latino to Asian to Native. You watch shows Black-Ish/Fresh Off The Boat and you UNDERSTAND the Humor and APPRECIATE IT. I don't want to befriend someone who doesn't know these things and has no compassion/understanding toward what's really happening to people in reality like un-armed Black males being killed. To me, you're a BASIC BITCH/BRO if you don't know this shit or can't even empathize with this situation. 


Has To Have Connections or Be Able to Build Connections/Have Good Interactions with others. - This one's self explanatory. The saying goes, you move quicker alone, but you go farther with others at your side. I'm quite capable of this. Making good connections requires basic rapport and also screening, which is obviously what I'm doing in this post. This means spotting business opportunities and advantageous social connections. 




Has To Know How To Make Good Money or Have Good Money So They Don't Skimp Out On You & Hoard All For Themselves. Good Friends Tend To Be Generous and Encourage You To Become A Generous, Kind Human Being As Well In Return. Paying It Forward. 


-Basically, you're the average of your 5 closest friends. You've ever been friends with a broke ass person who has poor money management skills and doesn't respect the power of a dollar? They're pretty dumb right (and make poor life choices)? I don't want my close friends to be broke, otherwise we can't learn how to make money from each other and prosper together. Also if you're friends are money makers, it encourages you to step your game up too all the time. And if something happens to one another, we always have each others' backs, not just take, take, take, but give when someone has an accidental slip up. 

We're generous when giving to each other in the time of need and using those resources wisely and effectively, and not recklessly and stupidly. Example; you're going through a bullshit lawsuit and I have money to help you out while your finances are tied up, I'd help you out in a heart beat and you repay me a year or 2 later back if/whenever I'm ever in a tough spot. 

Can't Be Pushy/Selfish Or Push Their Agenda If They Haven't Made It Themselves or You Feel Is Harming You/Your Energy.

---You can't give me advice and have me accept it if I didn't want it in the first place or if it's only helping you or is from your own agenda or bias and for your own ego. It has to come from a place of true understanding, such as what would you do yourself if you were in their exact shoes. Like if you liked your smoothies to taste a certain way, I wouldn't tell you to alter it if it only fits to my taste in my smoothies, and you yourself find it disgusting. 

Has To Care About Similar Things As You Or Can/Is Willing Care About Similar Things As You. 

This one is pretty damn self-explanatory. Also, I'm a person of aesthetics, and care about my health. Even if I'm not the guy fucking you, I very much prefer not to be in the presence of someone who is obese, male or female. I find it repulsive when I'm near someone fat/out of shape and I hear them struggling to breathe for air and when they sit down on a bench next to me, it's like a fucking mini-earthquake that just occurred. 


So if you're not a Basic Bitch, and you don't get your panties in a bunch from street lingo, or if you grew up in the projects and you know what's truly real and genuine (or you're just a genuine person in general), then feel free to hit me up, especially if a lot of points I mentioned in this post vibe with you.

There's a lot of snake, two faced Libras out there, and I ain't one of them. I'll tell you to your face what it is, and I expect the same. And if someone cuts us off while we're rolling in traffic, I'll yell in their face after I pull up next to them, and hand them their ass if they're asking for it, courtesy mutual combat law of Washington State. 

I'll also delete your post if I think it's spam. Better write our sign in the subject line or NOT SPAM, or it'll be deleted. 

Also random notes about me:

I cook a mean mango curry chicken.

I make crazy smoothies.

I'm involved in design/e-commerce.

I can sing pretty well.

I can hold an E note.

I love Keanu Reeves, even though his acting isn't the best. I feel an affinity with the dude, not in a gay way either.

I can crack you up at awkward times.

I have a wide taste in music, and I can name all the artists I do listen to.

Likes: Black women!. Classic Soul Music. R&B. Blues Music. Talking & texting on the phone all hours of the day. Going to the movies. Holding hands. Rocking the house at karaoke.

Some of my favorite shows I have binged watched are as follows: Game Of Thrones,True Blood, X Files, and Boardwalk Empire. Desire a woman who would hold me tighter and be loving on my bad days as we would whether the storm together as a couple.

Dislikes: Drugs. Heavy drinkers. Endless Emails and Texts. Life if too short to be wasted on such things.

(alright, lemme try this again. . .)

So, just thought I'd try this out. . ...
I moved here a little more than a year ago, got a job, and walked/drove around a bit, but still haven't made any friends in all that time. The solitude, though convenient for the most part, does take it's toll. Truth be told, I'm not much of a social person, hard to get to know at first, and chances are I'll probably flake out of meeting people who respond to this. But when I do end up making friends, I'm pretty loyal. 

About me: 35; straight; work full-time in construction; love binge-watching tv and movie marathons; love watching stand-up comedy. I HATE working out, BUT I do it anyway occasionally just to keep from getting injured (I'm at that age where everything is starting to 'crack'); read books/comics; not much of a gamer (last system i had was sega genesis); occasional drinker; 420-friendly. . .though I don't personally partake much cuz it's not allowed in my apartment and all it does is make me hungry, plus i save money for other stuff; NOT tech-saavy at all, and i guess my big thing WAS music. . ..haven't played for years, but before that, I was into a lot of metal and punk music, but I lost touch with it. Now i listen to a lot of podcasts. 

Stuff I'd like to do/get back into (but always find excuses not to): hike, rock climb, and other outdoor adventures; drive around more (still trying to figure seattle out, let alone washington); was an avid archer before i moved here; starting to dabble in martial arts; hoping to get back into drawing and art a little more; i'd like to play drums and guitar again, not professionally, but just to jam (i used to play mostly for hard rock and metal bands, but i like all kinds of music), if you have a set of drums and want free drum lessons i'm your guy. would like to learn violin and/or banjo among others, would like to learn another language, and eventually travel more. . .

i dunno. All this is theoretical. Honestly, I'm really a 'whatever' kind of guy. I'm not super pro or anti anything. I'm not 'PC'. In actuality, I'm pretty lazy/easy-going, and as much as i like to THINK about discovering new things and blah, blah, blah. . .I really just like to hang out. Just don't preach to me or be creepy or be a dick, i guess. Again, i'm not very social, and can be hard to get to know at first, so don't take it personally if I don't respond to you. I tend to be weary of people, especially on the internet (as I imagine any sane person should). Btw, I can't stress enough that I am absolutely NOT looking for a hook up/romantic relationship. Just a friend. Hell, if all you wanna do is chat or text on the phone, that's cool too. Thanks.

so here I am, posting to this site, haha.. not sure what I'm looking for, maybe a new friend? maybe more? I was with someone I thought was going to be my forever, and after 5 years, I guess she had different feelings towards that.. I never had any doubt, so my whole future was based around her.. I still blame myself for all the what ifs,.. it's hard. I haven't attempted dating or anything for over a year now.. To be honest, I'm lonely. I miss just feeling close to someone, I miss the sense of touch the most... 

I want a friend first and foremost, someone to catch a movie with, watch stupid TV with, go on weekend road trips with, get out and explore new things with each other wine and beer tastings, maybe smoke a bowl and watch a new pixar movie or slasher flick lol... what ever happens I don't want to be in a rush.. 

little bit about me, white male 36, could loose a few lbs before summer, so I guess I need to get on that. .6 foot 4, I currently have a full beard, I usually don't, but willing to shave it off for the right lady if she asks me nicely. haha... I am self employed for over 15 years now, I'm a super casual laid back easy going. . no children, just a bunch of nieces and nephews.. I come from a big Mormon family, my parents are still married after almost 50 years. . I look at what they have and know I want the same. . I just hope it's not to late for me.. 

love my blue apron meals and cooking, classic cars and trucks, anything that makes me laugh, love stand up.. History and exploring, Mt rainier to the beach.. 

anyways, if you feel like we might click, write me, send me a picture and maybe I'll send you one back, no picture till I get one. . it seems like this is haw it works, oh, and I really don't know what all these abbreviations are, so be blunt with me.. lol

good luck

Hello, I've been thinking how nice it would be to have a on call cleaning helper,
someone that's average looking, but not big'', and that's nice to be with.
I'm a company owner that works alone at night,
and I would just post in the gig's area on here if I wanted just anyone,
but I don't want just anyone, I want the person to be a friend too.
As weird as that may sound, I want us to be able to chat and get along too, not just work.
I don't know if that would be looked at as weird, or not.
I only want some light cleaning help from time to time, so maybe a Saturday sometime is all I want,
and finding a friend to come in and hang out and help me with cleaning sounds like a better idea.
I have tried posting for a friend on here, someone from around here this area,
and I can't even seem to find that, and I don't want to bug everyone I meet to give my a hand,
so I'm looking for some advice from a woman, or maybe this sounds like something you may like?
if not maybe you can give me a idea on where to look, or how to look for her.
Thank you all for your point view''.

Well, I've been trying to get my money back out of an extra ticket I've got to no avail so I've decided to go the charitable-ish route instead. I've opted to trade it for company lol. 

Me and my cousin will be heading down a little early on Saturday, just looking for someone fun and energetic who wants to ride along and do a little pregaming at the bar beforehand. Not looking for any favors or pervy shit like that, just a high energy person to get amped up with before the show. Once we get inside you are free to keep hanging out or ditch us and find some other people to run with.

We will be staying at the Marriott up the street so you can either line up a ride home that night or crash back at the hotel. It's a queen suite so if you decide to stay there's a foldout bed in the living room, no having to cuddle up to a stranger unless you wanna lol.

Now, there's only three stipulations to this offer. 
1) be between 21-26 years old. 
2) be a sociable, energetic person. 
3) be 420 friendly. Actually, you don't even have to smoke. Just don't take issue with it if I do.

Also, we intend to roll at the show so if you plan on hanging out just know that will be happening.

Well, think that's about all I've got to say on the matter. Shoot me an email with a picture, a little about yourself, and any other questions you might have. If you sound like a good match I will respond in kind. Oh yeah and change the subject to the artist you're most excited to see.

I moved to Tacoma from Seattle in December, and now that my home base is largely stable, I'm redirecting some energy into trying to build a queer friend network down south. Say hi if you're in Pierce county, especially north Tacoma!

Some stuff about me:
I'm 27, cis [she/her or singular 'they' pronouns], queer [largely attracted to hard femmes, androgyny & masculinity], femme-identified, polyamorous [currently 1 live-in partner + 1 comet partner, open to dating], child-free [& don't want any], multi-medium artist, self-employed small business owner, empath & HSP, energy worker [reiki], proud SJW, cat lady, out since age 14. Some hobbies include travel, photography, writing, coffee, meditation, thrifting, writing sarcastic things on the internet, smoking a bowl and having soul-enriching conversations. I'm not really into small talk; I'd much rather honor authenticity and get to know you as a person, not play games.
I work from home, so while getting out and seeing the city is important to me, I'd also love to eventually find people I could hang out with often and invite over during the day for coffee dates, study hall [meaning: we both work but occasionally chat], hangouts, & whatever. Since we might meet from CL first, though, we'll stick to a coffee shop.
Thanks for reading!

Hey Baby,

I really missed you this weekend. I thought about you a lot for whatever reason.

I hope this finds you well and happy. Do you feel good? I hope you were not too lonely without me. What were you doing this weekend? You didn't have to work, I hope. Did you manage to get something accomplished or was it just a lazy weekend? Any good movie,good eats, did you get all rain soaked too?

Saturday,I went down to the Edmonds Goodwill, found a beautiful Patagonia jacket. It was a nice day. Stopped at PCC too, got a few goodies. Went and had my hair colored/cut. After that, went out with my brother. We did have a good time, smoked some ganja, shot a few games of pool, then down for some some Creole food. But it wasn't the same with out you there. Downright depressing having a family relation for a date, no matter how well you get along.

Sunday, did some chores, went to Costco. Made a special trip to Home Depot, where I did not find what I was looking for, which was quite irritating. And it was so stormy out. I was getting soaked just trying to run a few errands. I thought screw it, and decided to just go back home. Good decision, a warm and cozy afternoon, watching the storm from inside, after the more tactile experience from earlier. I put my fuzzy pants on, made some cookies. Watched a depressing WWI movie with Russel Crowe, then John Oliver, and such. I love watching JO make fun of ""Drumpf."" It's a few minutes I can laugh about the whole thing, instead of feel that general sense of horror. He also did an informative rant about Special (local taxing) Districts. It was pretty interesting, they are like the ""black budget"" projects for the Feds, accountable to no one, only on a local taxation level. A little disturbing.

I made Petrale Sole and Artichokes for dinner. You would have loved that, I would have had so much more fun with you there to laugh and cuddle with. I am almost finished with my Bill Bryson book.

Any who, I am back to work on Monday morning, another drizzly day. Beats last year's drought conditions I guess. Like you, I have always loved the rain. I really like my new office space, and it's great having someone divert so many calls now. We will have more time to spend together. I am live streaming KEXP right now, they frown on that here, but I found a work around :). Gonna go to my Monday night work out after work tonight, then I will be back safe home again.I took a silly selfy of me right before work out the other day. I was feeling particularly vital and youthful at the time (gotta capture the moment don't always feel like that these days - ha ha). Maybe I could send it to you.

Sometimes, I just can't wait to look in your kind eyes, and see your beautiful smile.I can imagine you holding me tight, and the relief I will feel knowing you are there. I am OK by myself, but can be hard without you sometimes.These guys I have met, they are not you, so I don't even bother. Why even? - with the too young and ""friends with benefits"" bull shit - if it's not for reals. And because I know you have stayed faithful to me too for the same reasons. You are out there, I feel you, and it's going to be worth the time it took my love.

As Always!

The other day I was checking stuff out on Facebook. When a picture caught my eye. It was one of those ""people you may know"" pictures. It took me a second before I realized I did know the woman in the picture. My high school sweetheart. Class of 19 hundred and 78. Lisa was her name, and for a nano second she once again made my heart smile. I think her dad was my age when I started dating her. He was a big man with an evil eye on me. Lol. Rightfully so. I was a senior she was a freshman. I still Remember the first time I met her. I was throwing a football around in my front yard with a friend. She was on her bike, and stopped to watch me. She was 14, I was 17. I didn't like her. Thought she was a pest and she wouldn't leave me alone. One day she even came to my house asking for me. My mom thought it was cute and says ""oh he's in his room go on in"" (that was a mistake lol). After awhile she seemed pretty cool. Sort of a tomboy type. We talked, started hanging out together, fishing together, making out in my 64 Chevy in my front yard, (what the hell was I thinking, oh ya I wasn't) of course we got caught. Mom didn't think she was so cute then. Lol. She was my only girlfriend in highschool, my first love, my first best friend. Unfortunately (kind of) before I met her I had already signed the line to join the Navy. She couldn't handle the long distance and I don't blame her for moving on. I mean come on we were just kids. There is a lot more to this story but I will spare you the details. One thing I know is I loved that girl. Everyone said it was just a crush, or I think I loved her. Well that was over 35 years ago. And her picture still moves me today. I was right. I did really love her. Have you ever wondered if things went differently how your life would have maybe changed. 

Here's to you Lisa. There has been and always will be a spot in my heart for you. Love always Jim.

Good morning, I hope you had a nice weekend, and if you see this post later in the week, I hope your week is going well.

I am looking for a bit of an odd strictly platonic relationship. I am looking for a woman who goes to the Y in Sumner and wants to have a secret buddy. We will only chat in email, we will share no face pictures. What we can do is know we each have a secret buddy at the gym, whom might be there when we are and who might not. A secret admirer in a way. We can push each other to our fitness goals. We can also have fun in some ways with each other, through flirting or whatever, but we will never meet. Well we can chat about it and see if it works for us. If you are interested in chatting about it the ideas are endless and I am wide open. Shoot me a note and lets chat.

And see where it might go from there.

Happy rainy season to my fellow Seattleites, I'm hoping I am able to find someone looking for something similar to me. I'm looking for my secret friend, that friend I get to keep to myself, email, txt, kik with. To keep me grounded, give me honest feedback, and to be my sounding board. I lost that when I moved here four years ago, and with my hectic life, haven't been able to find it since. Someone I can grab coffee or lunch with, share a laugh and keep a sense of clarity that I need.

Me - late 30's, white, married, sarcastic, a bit geeky, well read, educated and have a stable job.

You - near my age, enjoy sarcasm, looking for a friend to chat with, and able to carry a conversation.

Where it goes? Don't know, but open to possibilities. Hope to hear from you soon.

Your looks, ethnic background, age, etc. are not important to me as long as you are comfortable with my age and you are emotionally stable - no drama.

Hello all! I'm currently looking for a new female friend to help spark my own interest. Someone I can talk to without fear of any sexual tension between us what so ever. 

I am engaged to a beautiful woman and love her dearly however our situation is complicated for me to explain. I love her but we have been so attached to one another I need to have a friend or friends of the opposite sex to converse with. And I prefer to find someone intellectual I can talk to when I am free or text and actually have a friend. But I will warn all who respond, my fiance is an extremely jealous person however I have nothing to hide, I really am looking for a friend.

There are terms and conditions to what I am looking for.

Little bit about me:

Working professional, Marine Diesel Mechanic 12 hours most days when work is heavy.
I love pot, I love to talk about it, I would hope you have some sort of green thumb.
I look pretty damn good considering what I did to transform my body. There's no polite way or good way to make this sound ok but.....please be level headed and care about your whole body, not just physical appearance.

I like to talk vision and life goals, the older I get,the wiser I have become. I am starting to see a much bigger picture of life.

I prefer text

Write me a short little email describing yourself and what you do and maybe we can be friends.


I love poetry FYI.

Hello.

I'm seeking connection. I'm a lonely fairy creature.

I'm an intelligent, eccentric, eclectic, adorable, ridiculous, charming young lady. I'm exceptionally sweet and still delight in all the marvels in this world. I'm one of the most accepting and open-minded people you'll ever have the chance to meet. I appreciate the little things, I allow them to delight me. I'm quirky and weird and creative. Definitely an artist. 

I treat everyone with kindness and enjoy being treated with kindness in return.

I love animals and children. I'm the sort of person who was born to be a mother, very nurturing and maternal. Part of being an excellent mother (to me) means waiting for the right time.

I'm new to this area. Seeking friendship, mentorship, nurturing, mutually beneficial relationships. 

I am a recent college graduate, working almost full-time making no more money than I did prior to attending college. I enjoy my job, though I am seeking better opportunities. I'm in a transitional period in life, in a temporary room mate situation, out of a long term relationship, ready to make friends, but no longer willing to commit to anyone who isn't marriage and co-parenting material. Some days I dream about having a prince come and whisk me away. I'd love to devote myself to a family. And I am a princess, in the sweetest way. 

Some Daddy issues. Enjoy gentle, firm, dominant older men.

Simultaneously fiercely independent. In an aching, lonely sort of way.

Kinky as shit.

Intriguing? 

Seeking nourishment. Hungry soul.

420 friendly, lover of arts an crafts, music, theater, movies, magic, whimsy, adventure

Are you a writer, an artist, a composer, an actor or a business guy? Have you been looking for a private, peaceful, quiet place to live and work?

Consider sharing a mostly-furnished ""mature mansion"" perched on the water's edge, on Bainbridge Island. Look across the Sound at Seattle, watch the ferries go by, yell at the gulls and herons, and walk on the beach (low tide). You would have your own upstairs (large) bedroom with adjoining bathroom. You would have access to a downstairs great room (with tv, wifi and music), a fully equipped chef's kitchen and an old-fashioned sun room, with perfect light for painting, drawing or working. A piano could even be arranged. Large outside deck is one of the greatest places to enjoy a Bainbridge summer. Street parking. Ten minutes from downtown Winslow and the ferry terminal. Kitsap Transit commuter bus passes right by the house.

I am a local single guy and have lived alone on the property for four years, established connections on the Island for twenty. I am making some serious career/life changes which are limiting me from covering the monthly rent and expenses without some help. I would be looking for $1100 per month to cover your portion of the rent and shared utilities (water/garbage, electricity, fuel oil, tv/wifi, no house landline phone). You'd only need to buy your food and drink.

I am seeking a single, established, financially secure/responsible professional, whose life circumstances would make such a situation attractive. No cigarettes. No pets. I'd prefer at least a three month commitment, and could agree to month-to-month beyond that.

Please respond and tell me why this situation might be good for you. We can arrange to talk on the phone or meet face-to-face to discuss this opportunity in more detail. Personal and financial references will be required.

It's Saturday night after errands and the like and now my brain is just ready for conversation. I hope to talk with you - if you're awesome, humorous, enjoy back and forth repartee, know witty jokes or converse about most anything else.

What do you do with your free time? What interests you or has you curious?

I'm looking forward to you bringing it!

Oh, hello there. I'm Canadian and live about 14 hours away from you, let's get that out of the way right off the bat. [Insert an ""everyone moving to Canada if Trump is elected"" joke] I totally lied and put a random Seattle zip code - but I'm only looking for a pen pal of sorts, not trying to cheat the system.

I might be a little old fashioned but I still enjoy crafting emails and receiving them. It's almost like this practice has been relegated to the same sphere as smoke signals, carrier pigeons and telegrams [outside of necessary work email communication]. Anyone I personally correspond with on a regular basis reaches me through more instant messaging means. There is definitely something to be said about that immediate feedback but there's also a satisfaction that comes with giving and receiving a well thought out message, however short, in email form. I'm not asking for novels here, I'm asking for random musings from absolute strangers, knowing that a person has decided to dedicate a small portion of their time to share their thoughts with me. Need an outlet for something? Plug into me. I just realized how sexual that sounded but I'm going to leave it there for comedic value.

Howdy, hopefully you have had a fine day as I have, to this point. For whatever reason you are reading this, maybe something here will pique your interest :) I'm Aaron and currently on vacation to Seattle from South Dakota. 26 years old, I am Native American, about 6'2 with short hair and gauges. I play guitar and seek a spiritual path in life, what does spiriruality mean to you? Right now I am doing my best to use the force and go with the flow. It's my first time out of the Midwest though and I have no friends in Seattle. I have had a great time wandering and exploring within the downtown area on my own, plus the hostel I am staying in has great people but something is missing. Maybe just the feeling of a long cruise around the area, seeing the views and enjoying the sound together. I would love a long conversation filled with passionate dialect and intellectual stimulation. Let me make you laugh and feel comfortable with yourself while we spend time getting to know one another. I am a true empath and so there is never an awkward moment with me, awkward silence is not my middle name. I enjoy science fiction and philosophy but also good cannabis with beer on occasion. Studying is a passion of mine, so maybe I am a nerd but it can't be a bad thing that I am more keen on who was chosen to take the acting mantle of Peter Parker than whichever candidate wins the presidential election. If anything I said sounds appealing then please, I implore you to send me a reaponse! This is my first vacation and I would love a friend to help me make it perfect. Who knows, maybe even romantic? Anyway, I cannot wait to hear back from whoever you are.

Love Always,
Aaron

I need a friend. I've been going through a rough patch in life lately and not having anyone to lean on or share my experiences with has affected me. Sometimes I wan't for someone to lean on me. I feel lonely and unmotivated. I need interaction. 

If this sounds like you then perhaps we could befriend each other? I won't judge you and you won't judge me. Wherever you come from in life is okay with me. 

I am looking for someone to talk to, spend time with, someone with whom to find distraction from the status-quo. 

Reply via craigslist email. Tell me why you need a friend. Tell me about what holds you back (your demons) and I tell you what holds me back (my demons). Your pic gets mine. I also don't want to be in charge of this so tell me what you want/expect from me. 



P.S. I've never done this before and have no idea what to expect :/

Hi 
I moved to Washington at the end of 2014. Would like to meet someone who likes to hike around these beautiful mountains. I have taken some classes with the Tacoma Mountaineers and so know how to be safe out there and not get lost. I hike in My Rainier Nat Park a couple of times a week but am open to other places. I would like a hiking partner who can and enjoys hiking 5 to 10 miles and if part of a hike---1000 to 2000 ft elevation gain.
Please share a picture of yourself with your first email and I'll share mine with you.

Welcome to fellow Jeep Wranger owners...

I am posting searching for a friend/s to travel along forest roads, backroads, cross country travel, attend Jeep events, as well as Jeep Jamborees. I'm already registered solo for two jamborees this year.

You don't have to be interested in doing all to respond

More interested in using my vehicle to access and enjoy scenic vistas, that only a capable vehicle would allow. Not looking to test the limits of my vehicle, but not against a challenging trip. 

Someone who also enjoys camping, hiking, photography and or film making would especially spark my interest. I am a photographer and filmmaker as well. So documenting our journeys could possibly be collaborative.

Look forward to your responses, and to the rest... ""It's a Jeep thing, you wouldn't understand""

Hi there...

Looking for someone fun to get to know, hang out with and work together towards exercise and getting in shape.

A little about me: Single, smart, good friend / good listener, fun, sarcastic, soft hearted, athletic, work full-time in Redmond, but live in Seattle. I've had real success in getting in shape and living a healthy lifestyle when I have friends to do it with.

I work out at LA Fitness in Ballard and really want a workout buddy, where we can meet at the gym, do classes together, or ride bikes, walk, hike, etc. And also talk about our challenges, support each other and be accountable. I have 60 lbs to lose, I would prefer someone that has somewhere around there, but certainly not required.

You: Fun, open, smart, DEPENDABLE, guy or girl, gay or straight, religion and race, I'm totally open. Just wanting to meet platonic friends that want to lose weight, have fun and accomplish our goals together.

If this sounds like you, hit me up. Lets meet for a drink or coffee.

Oh and tell me a little about yourself and what you're looking for.

Age totally open but early thirties to late forties might be the best fit.

This one is to discuss the craigslist experience itself!

Bad coz I check my inbox too often, read useless posts and respond to people who are never to write to me!


Good coz its thrilling - the excitement of waiting for a good response to your post or even better the excitement of getting the next message from someone you hit it off with. That adrenalin rush is so damn cool! 

Its like a whole world in itself.

Any of you want to just chat about that? If yes send me an email with ""Craigslist"" in the subject.

Good afternoon ladies

I am a mid 50's gent that stands 5' 6"" and weighs in roughly at 145lbs with dirty blonde/grey hair and a neatly trimmed beard. I have a variety of both indoor and outdoor interests and also enjoy most movies/music.

I am seeking a lady over the age of 45, will consider someone as young as 40 though, that would like to get to know each other and build a friendship. I am not picky about a persons looks as beauty is only skin deep, one's mind and thoughts are more important than one's beauty or size. I also have no problems if your married and just looking for a friend to chat with, but must be open to talking about the dark side of things, meaning the things you enjoy but are afraid to explore or talk about to others behind closed doors.

If anything I've said sounds of interest then please drop me a few lines telling me about yourself. Please use the subject line: Lets Be Friends. That way I'll have some kind of an idea that you are a real live living/breathing human being, pictures would also be nice and help in telling me that you are real.

If we hit it off then maybe down the road we can meet face to face over coffee or something.

Look at my flaws: I judge people by their writing. I'm easily bored. I'm vain. I have a thousand half-finished projects. I fear that, after I die, I will have left nothing of consequence in the world. It seems I also have an imperfect commitment to monogamy, at least in my imagination if not in practice. I also don't believe in sin.

And yet: I am smart, and sometimes funny. I am frequently a good listener, and almost always a good friend. I love a wide range of improbable things, books about Japanese dystopias and giant lawn flamingos and costume jewelry and videogames and big dogs and poetry disguised as song lyrics, and a thousand thousand other things. I am imperfect, wondrous and flawed.

Both side of me are evenly odd.

My name is Aleshanee. (Al-eh-shaw-knee)

I'm into yoga; I go to the Yoga Loft and I am studying to get my certification in yoga instruction. 

I love music. I love listening to and discovering new music. New genres, new bands, whatever. I just love taking it all in. I especially love music made by my friends. I love to see the people I love expressing themselves through their art. To me there's no better way to get to know a person. I love local shows, and the harder and faster the better. There's little I find more enjoyable than being surrounded by sweaty aggressive kids rocking out to awesome music. The whole experience is just kind of what life is about to me.

I am a terrible artist. Like, stick figure bad. But I like to paint, and I love to see other people's art. My favorite artist is Salvador Dali, because I love his dual meanings, and how much weirder he got as he got older. I love museums, street art, tattoos, everything. I love it all. 

I love to read, in fact I spend more time reading than pretty much anything else because I'm usually really fucking bored. I love being transported into different worlds and realities, and coming away with a new perspective on life.

I LOVE to dance. I am strength-training myself to get back into ballet to re-learn some technique so that I can return to my true love, contemporary. 

I am also training to be an aerialist! I have my own ropes and everything. 

I have a career in the cannabis industry, I've been steadily working over the last year and have a ridiculous amount of information on the history, culture, medicinal applications, and legislature of cannabis. 

I am awkward, like, hopelessly awkward, but in an endearing way. I am passionate about life, I love to help people I care about, I am very bad though, at making friends. I don't talk very much, and it takes awhile to get to know me.

I can't seem to meet anyone who I can keep a connection with. We all need friends, you can't just go through life all on your own without sustaining considerable damage to your psyche. 

So if you'd like a funny, kind, creative, blue-haired, pot smoking gal who rarely speaks to be friends with, here I am. I'm willing to give all you weirdos a try. Unless you're creepy, or just not very nice. Then fuck you.

I am a good guy that is just now learning some tough lessons about how to redirect life towards permanent change and away from the streets. What type of feelings and emotions do you got bottled up that could use a release? I am intelligent and have a broad level of understanding that touches base on a little bit of everything. Want to vent? Got any issues that need conversation without a clause? Let's talk. I am a conversationalist and writer at heart. Not looking for anythig serious; just good ole conversation. T.T.Y.L.

Hi everybody. 

Winter is a slow boring time for me. My job is seasonal so I've got a lot of down time right about now. I'd just like a chat partner through email. 

I'd prefer if you were married or in a relationship. This isn't an elaborate plot to cheat on our spouses, just makes it so we're on equal footing. 

That said, innocent flirting and sexual discussion would certainly not be unwelcome. On good thing about the initial anonymity is that we can say anything we want without retribution. 

I live east of the mountains so I won't use this as an excuse to get you to meet up, but I do make it over to Seattle on occasion so if it ever came up I wouldn't be opposed.

Anyway, just for chat. If you're interested let me know.

Please and thank you.

Hey there. Spring is almost here and that means outdoor adventures are soon to be had! I am new to Centralia and don't have a lot of friends here so I'm looking for some new PLATONIC outdoor activity friends, male or female. I'm going to reiterate myself and stress that this ad is in the strictly platonic section, so I'm not interested in hooking up with anyone. 

Anyway, I'm 35, female, not in great shape at the moment but that's why I need hiking friends. I refuse to go hiking alone as: #1 It's boring and #2 It's unsafe for a woman to go wandering around the woods alone. I don't want to take the risk. I might bring my friend's dog (Australian Shepherd) along with me occasionally, as he doesn't get out often and needs the exercise and socialization. 

Hoping to hear from someone! Thanks!

Massages are awesome - we all know that and if we can get them for free - they are super awesome!

This is not sexual ... period!
I'm not crazy ... you'll find out the moment we meet (and we ofcourse meet in public first!)
I'm decent looking (if that matters) and I'm absolutely clean (I know that matters!)

We pick times to meet up and we relax each other - if you have never done it its fine. I'm not looking for a pro - just someone who is willing to try. I'm fine getting 30 min massage each time and giving 60 minutes.

Update: I've posted before, but only to have people flake out. I have no idea why it's so hard to find someone willing to give as well as get a massage. You can go second so you get the most time and a better experience if you like. It's a rainy, grey day. Let's try and have a little relaxation. Nothing more is expected.

Hello,

I'll keep this short and sweet. I doubt it will go anywhere anyway.

I am single, fit and have a nice home in Silverdale. I have a massage table and give an amazing rub! I work out regularly and also like to stay very active. 

Not only do I love to give massage, once in a while I would love to get one! I hate paying for them as I think sometimes the best are between friends who aren't watching the clock and who will listen when I give them direction on what feels good. Honestly I have had problems with both when paying.

So, we can be friends who enjoy each others company and conversation, or we can just be two people who need a nice, no pressure massage. 

Not to sound like a jerk, but I do want a massage. Not to rub on you for over an hour, hop on the table and after 5 minutes of light passes of the hands, have you say you're tired. Nor do I want to get up and have you grab my privates and think that's all I'm there for.

Don't worry if you're inexperienced or don't think you have the hand strength. I can teach you what to do and how to use your weight to do the work without hardly any stress to you at all. How do you think professionals do this all day every day?

If you are interested in this, I would love to hear from you. We can chat a bit, meet somewhere public and safe for us both and see how we click. Honestly, I would love a massage today if you're up for it!

Thanks for reading and take care,

Hey hey, 

So basically I just moved to here from out of state, the economy here is dope! Haha, anyway it would be nice to talk to a female & possibly kick it.

About me, 6'3"", 34yrs old, no kids, lean, nerdy geek 

Obviously I'm not Idris freakin Elba but I'm told I'm similar just without the mustache...

(Not putting your photos online until you trust someone is smart right? Lol)

I love sci-fi (doctor who, firefly, Star Wars etc), horror movies, binge watching Netflix, video games etc

I do get out lol, but would rather hit the low key bar scene then a club. Hiking is cool, camping, road trips, nature stuff etc

I like 420....actually shocked at how many people are comfortable with it here lol. 

I come from a Gilmore girls-ish town on the east coast so trust when I say it's shocking how much weed is around lmfao

Anyway I'm looking to chat with a nerd, true nerd/geek is hard to find. 

Don't care what ethnicity you are or the shape you're in. Just want to chat with same minded people & see where it goes.

In search of single, active, straight guy to be friends with.

I moved here a few years ago and have been very career focused. In that time the small circle that I did have has gone in a million different directions and hey, that is life. Finding someone with similar interest would be ideal. 

A little about me: Late 20's, professional, travel frequently, spontaneous, sports fan, comedy junky, trivia/history nerd, story teller, pragmatic as fuck, snowboarder, hiker, as much a believer in fitness as craft beer, indiscriminate music listener, unapologetic man's man, and unwilling to affiliate with any political party.

I don't have a problem flying solo and frankly it never stops me from doing things, it just seems very difficult to expand your social circle as a single adult. If you are in the same position and don't think I sound like a complete asshat give me a shout. Cheers!

Hi.

Join me for a morning drink!

I work nights, and around 10 a.m. have a glass of red wine to slow myself down a bit and get to sleep for my next night shift.

I am tired of doing this alone.

I would like to pour another glass for an average-sized local lady who can join me for a drink at this time without adversely affecting her schedule or life. I'll happily serve you a glass of my current cabernet, or pour you the drink of your choice.

Cheese, crackers, grapes, avocado - all entirely feasible.

If you are a talker, we can talk. If not, we can turn on Netflix and see what's new. I am not trying to slink my way into a date - if I want to do that, I'll be up front about it. I'm really not looking for that now. This is truly about no longer needlessly spending this time of day alone. 

I am a very well employed, tidy, clean, decent-looking guy (descriptors which fit my home, as well) and am asking for you to pen a quick sentence or two about yourself, and a pic if you are interested. I know there must be a lady out there who wouldn't mind joining me for a free, mid-morning drink. 

Any age from 21 up to my own (47) is just fine.

Please let me know a bit about you and your favorite drink. If we seem like a fit, let's talk!

Please remember to include a pic for consideration! 

Thanks for looking!

I'm always there for friends, and I've been known to answer the phone in the middle of the night. I'm a great listener and enjoy helping people navigate through tough times and love celebrating the good times. I don't miss events that are important to close friends and sometimes acquaintances. But it seems that things don't always go both ways. I know who the reliable people are and of course they are a high priority, but sometimes I just help too much when maybe I shouldn't.

Of course the obvious answer is to keep being there for people and know when to cut people off. But it it gets old sometimes, right? 

Anyway, tell me what you think. What's on your mind? And if you have something completely unrelated and need to talk, I enjoy listening. I just can't put my number on here because I'd get some strange calls from CL people, I'm sure. And no, I'm not ugly :P

I don't understand why you're so good to me!
I wanted you as my next of kin
Now, I wonder why you've let me in
And it's not just to empty the garbage bin
Enough water from clouds to evolve fins under my arm pits
But more stream from my eyes
from your compassion
Yup, it stirs within
and cause of your kindness
frustration 
is in the process of dissipation 
while my other relations
aren't as patient
And drive me into isolation 
Causing my bad reputation
Yet, you hold me like, ""forgiveness is my main motivation!""
Now, I intend 2
look at u 
and them as a friendship
Letting go of the condemnation

I've never been hit like that before and wonder if its really that bad? Just like any other guy I've had the occasional tap, but seems like the other guys are playing it up. Of course its uncomfortable but it never hurt anywhere near how I see other guys react.

Since I don't have anything else better going on I figured I'd hit up craigslist and see if there is a woman bored as I am who'd want to find out as well. Maybe meet up for drinks first, lol. Could even make it interesting and place a bet on it.

Looking for a female training partner for Brazilian Ju Jitsu. I'm taking a course online which gives detailed instructions on how to learn, but need a partner.

Someone to hang out with, smoke with, enjoy a nice meal with, and hold actual grown up conversations with. someone who doesn't get offended very easily.

Hello!
My name is Ryan and I'm a personal trainer trying to build my own, local client base.

I've been personally working out and passionate about health, physical fitness, and working with others in pursuit of their goals for over 11 years!

After working with friends for a few years, I decided this was a career path I really enjoyed and wanted to follow after. 
I've earned my certification and am now ready to start helping you change your life!

I specialize in weights/cardio/kickboxing/mma, much more geared to fun, applicable workouts to burn fat and build muscle quickly.

While I take an observant approach to help determine your current states and goals, I'm a very involved trainer and will do the workout right next to and with you.

Most of my clients prefer this way as it keeps more of a team effort than simply you doing workout with a drill sergeant yelling at you.

I'm listing several ads, trying all I can to get myself out and help others.

Please, don't flag my ads, competition is good for us all.
Please help support, or let your friends/family know who are trying to change themselves and their lives.

I want to and am passionate about empowering people to take control of their lives.

My workouts are fun, exciting, effective, and I'm excited to meet and help you realize your goals!

Please feel free to reach me by phone or text, email is also acceptable.
I have an open schedule due to training full time so 24hr gyms and schedules are even doable for night shift people wanting to improve.

My prices are extremely fair and I'm always willing to work with groups on price or buying a few sessions at once.
Please call, text, email with any questions.

Love and respect,
Ryan

I'm looking for a unique kind of relationship. Basically, I'd like to meet a woman who wouldn't be shy or feel guilty about asking me to do things for her from time to time. It could be housework or errands. And I don't want to be paid. I've tried this kind of thing a couple of times before, and enjoyed it. Maybe there something you don't like doing yourself. Maybe you just like the idea of someone working for you and doing what you ask. I am talking small things. I won't help you move, and I won't paint your house. But if you want me to, for example, do your dishes, or wash your car, or bring you lunch, or carry your bags in the mall, I will. Tell me about yourself, and I'll tell you more about me.

I like movies, camping, shopping, eating out, hanging out with friends, going out sometimes, and occasional drinking :) I'm looking for someone who is drama free, not a liar, has my back, and plans on sticking around forever. I have a lot of friends but not that 'best friend'. I am 5'3 and overweight, but attractive and working on the weight part lol.

Greetings.

I relocated here from a much warmer state. :) My few good friends are all by phone, these days. I'd love to know even one person to go for walks with, or meet for a tea or coffee, and speak to, in person! I should say that I'm usually most comfortable with women friends...age doesn't much matter, nor do the other details.

I'm 43, have two dogs I adore (lab and German shepherd), and a husband. No kids, unfortunately, and very little drama and slim tolerance for it. I'm probably too much of a homebody, so could stand to change that, a bit; I don't work, and so the combination of these things makes it tough to meet potential friends.

I love vintage 20s/30s music, also some classical, bluegrass, 50s country, 80s pop...a variety, really.

I'm a low key person who enjoys solitary pastimes--reading, watching my soaps (yeah, I'll admit it--I even watch a British one. LOL), baking, writing, visiting thrift stores and antiques, etc. I'm trying to teach myself German. :)

I'm content, for the most part, but would welcome some companionship. I'm not so particular as to be only looking for a clone of myself; I'm interested in learning new things, hearing about what my friends enjoy. I'm a decent listener, too, I think.

I'm pretty easy-going, but I do want real life friends, not just texts or email. Occasional texts are fine, but I prefer phone calls. Please get in touch, and let's see what happens!

I am REALLY reluctant to post this ad because I am SO against drama, but I really want a friend that I see on a regular basis. I have some amazing friends, but I just don't see them enough. So, I really hope to find a true friendship here where we can hang out AT LEAST bi weekly. :) 
A little about me, I'm 27 years old. I'm married to the most amazing guy in the world and together, we have the coolest and sweetest five year old little girl. I am a complete doofus and love to make people laugh. I love to blog (tumblr for the win), color, write poems, take pictures (HUGE passion of mine), cooking, and baking. I'm really creative and apply that in much of what I do. I'm a total caffeine junkie and drink lots of Starbucks. I've been told I make amazing coffee at home too. :) I LOVE metal music. My favorite bands are From Ashes To New, I Prevail, Five Finger Death Punch, and Bring Me The Horizon. I love going to concerts and saw Five Finger Death Punch last year. We are going to Slipknot this year. :) I have a huge heart and love silly things like Pokemon and My Little Pony. (I am getting a tattoo for both). I'm extremely loyal and blunt as fuck. I DO NOT sugar coat anything. I am a realist and believe in accepting life. I have struggled a lot in recent years, having been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. That set my life back by about 3 years, but I woke up one morning and was like, to hell with this. I'm going back to school soon for family therapy. It's my life's purpose to help others. :) I am 4/20 friendly... I just don't want it around my kid. I accept all types of people. I have trangender, intersex, and non-binary friends. I also like D/s (dom/sub) and would need a friend who accepted these things about me and them. Lastly, I am really finally getting my life together and NEED a friend who wants to share in the good things in life and keep me smiling through this part of my life. I don't need baggage. I need smiles, good memories, and love :D I will obviously return the favor. 

Please DO NOT email me if you're looking for any of the following -
- Drama or someone to gossip too. 
- If you're someone who can't handle the truth. Little bitches ARE NOT welcome in my life. 
- If you plan to involve me in your infidelity. I pride myself on being loyal and trustworthy. If you have ANY intentions of being more than friends, I am NOT the person for you. 
- If you wanna go on and on about your baby momma drama or relationship bullshit. (Now.. let me clarify, if you're having a hard time with a fight or something, I will absolutely support you, but there's a difference between that and a CONSTANTLY unstable and toxic relationship. Know the difference). 
- If you want someone to get plastered with. I DO NOT drink or want any part in it. 
- You are judgmental and not okay with all types of people and dynamics. 

PLEASE DO email me if -
- You want a truthful, positive, long lasting, drama free, friendship.
- You want someone to game or color with.
- You want someone to get coffee with, watch netflix with, or cook/bake with. 
- You are okay with kiddos and or have some of your own.
- You want puppy play dates. 
- You love to laugh and want to laugh so hard your sides hurt. 
- You want someone to drive around with blasting tunes and annoy people. lol
- You are accepting of all people. 
- You are an adult and know how to handle a real friendship. 

If you're still interested, please send me an email. I can send my kik or number. I'm a total textaholic. :) Have a wonderful rest of your week and thanks for reading. :D

Hey, thanks for clicking on my post. Hopefully this is the first step in making a new friend.. Unfortunately, my work and school schedules are crazy Monday - Thursday, so I'm hoping this will be a good way to meet some new, cool people. BTW, crazy weather we're having?!?! Should be nicer starting tomorrow (Tuesday). So, I know that this Craig's List and this section isn't really for platonic friends anymore; it used to be but I guess not so much now. However, I still have faith that there are still people out there, like myself, that are just looking for friends. Ok, I moved out here a few years back and I make some really good platonic friends on here back then. Unfortunately, they've either moved away to Ballard (you know some place so far away that they refuse to leave their new The Shire to come back to visit the old one) or they actually moved away (out of the area). Again just to be clear, I'm truly just looking for platonic friends to do stuff with. Absolutely no funny business. Period. I'm a laid back, non-smoking, educated, progressive, ""lefty"", black guy looking to expand my circle. Bottom line, I'm just looking for friends who would be up for grabbing a drink sometime, going to movies, running/jogging, soccer/flag football, working out, hiking, rock climbing and talking. Good conversation is essential; being able to discuss issues [and solutions] in technology, the environment, world events/affairs, non-commerical media, politics (again I'm a proud, educated progressive but very respectful of differing views). I know that's a crazy laundry list, but I'm truly open to meeting new, non-flaky people. If any of this sounds interesting and you're not a flake, please feel free to email me back. Thank you again for clicking and reading. I look forward to melting through the freeze and making some new friends.

Hello,

I am a 27 year old man and due to some infidelity on her part, my wife has moved out. We are now separated and I have found myself completely alone out here in a cold home with no one else but my puppy dog.

I am not necessarily looking for a romantic or sexual relationship, though I wouldn't be totally opposed to one if it were to develop. I am mostly just looking for a cool person to hang out with. I'd love to snuggle up in the bed, under the heated blanket, grab some pizza and enjoy each others company as we watch something on the TV. Something like Mystery Science Theatre 3000, Rifftrax, Rick & Morty, Futurama or the like.

I am a pretty introverted guy who enjoys his alone time, but I don't like being completely on my own. I don't intend on replacing my wife or something, but meeting some new people out here would be good for me. To give you an idea of who I am, I am studying Game Design. I like video games, movies, TV, and most any other form of visual media. I draw, write, sculpt, and constantly look for other creative outlets for myself. I tend to prefer quiet nights in, entertaining myself with the things or people around my home. However, I can be convinced to go out for a movie, a meal, etc.

If any of this sounds like something you would be interested in, please, get in touch with me. Just reply to this posting or if you have kik you can find me at ""funnyhandlehere""

Working on the divorce paper-work. Legal stuff is so slow and boring. Living on my own again and that means I am totally alone.

I just need someone to distract me from all of this non-sense. Whether we ever meet or continue our relationship is up to you and our connection.

Put your favorite TV show in the subject line, so I can tell your real, or at least an intelligent bot.

I am 6'1"", dark brown hair, blue eyes, average build with a couple extra pounds that I am going to start working on losing.

I enjoy most kinds of visual media. Video games especially, they engage me more. Though I love a good movie or TV show if I am in a more laid back mood. Eating out and going to the movies is a standard night out. I am a creative person, I like to think, and have a long history in art.

I am looking for a musician friend. I love music but I have no family or friends that are musicians. I have been learning piano, organ, keyboard, music arranging, singing, and music theory on my own.

I am not using music for my own entertainment, but to reach out and help others. I know the true spirit of music is one of giving. Everything I learn, I share with others. I have already been asked to teach basic music theory, piano, and voice on more than one occasion. I do the best I can with the knowledge I have. I would love to find someone that believes in me and the work I do enough to want to help me. I love to learn. Things are always easier once someone shows you how. You will find me to be a quick, avid learner and grateful friend. I am sure you will find working with me a very rewarding experience. You will not only be helping me, but many other people as well. I am very religious but I am not judgemental. I don't care if you are religious or non-religious, gay or straight, just please remember I am only seeking a platonic friend.

I have a variety of interests other than music. I enjoy hiking, biking, and photography. I have traveled to Ecuador, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. I am currently learning Spanish.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

So here's the thing: I am trying to get out into the world as much as possible. My close friends moved away to different parts of the country, and the ones in the area have been so busy with their own lives. I too have been kept busy with work and school, but things are beginning to settle, and I have a feeling that it would be nice to meet new people. Who does not like making new friends?

I am pretty open-minded, love movies, and I am getting back into reading regularly. I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree, where I'm an economics/philosophy/political science major. Running is something I am re-learning to do (I was previously an avid runner), and I am training for a couple 5Ks. I savor the experience of food, especially Thai, where I cannot resist a good plate of pad see ew or pad kee mao. I'm learning to cook and I like comic books, so I have a few geeky moments.

I enjoy witty banter, have hobbies, and genuinely ask questions, so conversation will never be short.

My adult innocence is of the variety in which I simply don't mess with mushrooms. Why disturb an otherwise perfectly suitable and smurfy summer home?? 

However, I have a parent who may be in need of a variety of local pickings to try as a substitute to ECT treatments which like pharmapsueticals do nothing for this severe dependent condition.

And... as the system has pretty much taken away hopes of retirement and further made reliant on the system which continues to eat every dollar, there isn't much leverage for expensive treatments on the far and distant fringe of FDA approval. Death will come sooner.

So, foraging field guides out there, please recognize my pursuit-- really this is about company, education, and doing good on behalf of someone, to hopefully relieve the pressures of doctors, care-givers, therapists, and everyone involved. I'm hoping my research is right and I can find a solution towards normalcy after long suffering.

Straight guys are always welcome too.
I am looking for a platonic gay male companion/friendship for fishing (serious yet fun), hiking ( fun and moderate), Motorcycling (safe and fun), snowshoeing(fun moderate), boating (Puget Sound). A local gym buddy (Stanwood) would be great too.
I am an avid fisherman, hunter, outdoorsman, and motorcyclist. 
I retired in '15 (Natural Resources) so have much more time to enjoy the outdoors. I'm in pretty good shape(5'09"",215#) thanks to a 30 year career working in the outdoors.

My husband (30's) and I (50's) are easy going, educated,professional, masculine, gay men.
We are not guys whose being gay is obvious. (Being Descriptive of us-Not judgmental of others)
That said, we are well adjusted :), been together for nearly 10 years now. We enjoy meeting other gay couples for coffee or a bite to eat.
How about us getting outdoors and doing some serious fishing, or enjoying a hike or a boating excursion in the San Juans.
We put extensive miles on our motorcycles, having sold our Harleys and purchased a couple of R1200GS's (4000+ miles this summer)

Interested in meeting gay men that enjoy fishing, boating, the outdoors if they exist :)
Straight guys are always welcome too.
I am looking for a platonic gay male companion/friendship for fishing (serious yet fun), hiking ( fun and moderate), Motorcycling (safe and fun), snowshoeing(fun moderate), boating (Puget Sound). A local gym buddy (Stanwood) would be great too.
I am an avid fisherman, hunter, outdoorsman, and motorcyclist. 
I retired in '15 (Natural Resources) so have much more time to enjoy the outdoors. I'm in pretty good shape(5'09"",215#) thanks to a 30 year career working in the outdoors.

My husband (30's) and I (50's) are easy going, educated,professional, masculine, gay men.
We are not guys whose being gay is obvious. (Being Descriptive of us-Not judgmental of others)
That said, we are well adjusted :), been together for nearly 10 years now. We enjoy meeting other gay couples for coffee or a bite to eat.
How about us getting outdoors and doing some serious fishing, or enjoying a hike or a boating excursion in the San Juans.
We put extensive miles on our motorcycles, having sold our Harleys and purchased a couple of R1200GS's (4000+ miles this summer)

Why is everyone so concerned with finding the perfect person. I challenge anyone to find the perfect person as there is no such thing. The only thing that can even come close is finding the perfect person for you. And yes there is a difference.
Do you really want to find someone that is exactly like you? How exciting is that? And even it is how long will it last? The differences are what makes things much more interesting. At least that is my opinion.
I am posting this here because I am not looking for a relationship, but maybe a friend who understands what I am saying.
I am sure there are a lot of people who will disagree with me and that is ok because differences in opinion is what makes things interesting.

If you're a writer, then you know that when a specific moment overwhelms you -- you just have to get the thoughts out of your head. For some of us, it's moments of sadness or loneliness -- for others the pain is so great that you have no choice but to write about it. I've been there ever since I was 12 so I know how it works. For many years I couldn't go a day without writing. It was a part of me. The pain was too deep and writing was my outlet. I guess it was time to take a break. I had mixed writing about my pain with dabbling in erotica to distract me from the pain. It worked sometimes while other times I wanted nothing to do with it. For the last 5 years or so I stopped writing. That's the longest span I've gone since I was 12. I just made a decision to stop and I did. I played the piano a bit but writing was gone - something I never thought would happen. Until. . .My health was threatened. The possibility of breast cancer was a possibility which literally came out of nowhere. I had to take a bunch of tests but ended up OK. Unfortunately, while this was happening I had to sit at the Thanksgiving table and act like life as usual when for me it wasn't. Then, in January my son fell after kicking a soccer ball and got really hurt. I don't want to get into all of that but it's been 2 months later and we are still trying to get him better. I then cut my brother out of my life -- FINALLY -- and suddenly my life was a mess. What do you think I started doing almost immediately? Write. I haven't written as much as I would have because of my extenuating circumstances but I started to write again.

Writing heals, we all know this. I've always felt better after a good write. Yet sometimes when I was sick of writing about the pain I wrote about something else, romance, or fantasy and constructed it into a short story or something like that.

Being 45 I thought this group, would be great for those around my age. We'll have more in common, I think. But again, it's not a ""pre requisite"".

I created a Yahoo Group called ""Writing Heals"" and it would be great if you would join and give it a chance. I mean, what's the worst that can happen? Maybe you can meet some other people who are going through similar situations and this group could be about healing.

The only thing I don't want to do is LIMIT the type of writing shared in this group. It could be any genre. Why start a writing group if I start limiting genres.

If you have any interest, 

email me at scarletblack0307 @ yahoo . com and I will send you the link to join. 

It would be an honor to get to know you.

I'm kinda horny and would love to hook up tonight. I could tell you all about my personality and all, but you probably don't really care that much, lol. So I'll just tell you the basics. 34, single, 5'10"", have my own place (meaning I can host, and am looking to do so), I've been told that I'm a good kisser, well hung, and a world class cuddler. But I'm also smart enough to know that pretty much all men are told that at one point or another, lol. If you'd like I can send you a pic and you can decide for yourself. But unlike most guys, I don't see my cock as a magic wand that make most women want me, so I see no need to wave it around in their faces unless they ask me too, lol. If you're interested or have any questions, let me know. Please include a picture with your response and change the subject to your favorite color so that way I know you're real. Hope to hear from you soon.

So what had happened was.... 

I pretty much dedicate myself to my work, and I hate it. But I love my day to day, I'm the business of finance where you make your own pay check so the effort you put in determines what comes back to you. 

I was hanging out with my good friend yesterday, and we have that relationship where no matter how long it's been whenever we kick it; it's like it was just yesterday we saw each other. So it's been like a couple months since we heard from each other, we were talkin and he goes, ""so what do you do when you're not working?"" I think long and hard, and it's like damn I really don't be doing shit. So I hit him with, ""man I just relax and do laundry and run errands when I get the chance really"" 

I want to change the route my life is heading towards, I'm most comfortable in a tie or in my bed. I don't find it amusing anymore to go out, that needs to change! I went out to Ruth's Chris the other night, me and two other of my good friends were sat by this group of hot suburban housewives and I didn't say anything or try to create conversation! 

I'm looking to get to know everything about you, tell you my side. I just really want to get to know someone, and see where it goes. Friends, friends with benefits, girlfriend, wherever it goes! 

Don't be shy, I never had much in life so I know better than to judge somebody. I got blessed and had the opportunity to make something of my life, after many and many of times I messed up. I will never take anything for granted, cause anything could happen between now and the next day. 

I don't know why there's robots on here, but I'm real Doug Baldwin and Russell Wilson both just got engaged.

Hi and thanks for reading. You must be somewhat interested since you clicked on this :). I am single now for about 6 months and I am looking to get back into meeting and seeing where things go again. I am a busy guy and don't get a lot of chances to go out so I figure why not try this and see anyone responds. I am in a good position in my life right now as far as job, house and friends. However, it's nice to have someone special around and have someone to go out with/share all that. My main turn off is probably going to be you being a smoker. I just think it's nasty and I really don't want to be around that. No offense. I don't discriminate hehe. I am looking for someone fun, creative and real. I like to have nice long conversation over coffee and do things that regular people do I guess. I am into a lot of things but won't mention them here because then you'll know everything there is to know about me lol. That is not the point here. Anyway, please be cool, nice, in somewhat decent shape since I am fit. I'd like to know that you take care of your body and that you are somewhat active as well. A huge plus if you like sports. Anyway, I am not doing much tonight just kinda hanging out. Let me know if you'd like to chat. I am 27 btw!

I don't really need to be analyzed either.

Let me be clear. I'm not looking for a physical relationship right now. 
First and foremost, let's chat, and get to know one another. 
Should we want to talk on the phone, great
Should we want to meet in person, great. 

I am looking for intelligence, wit, wisdom, and thoughtfulness. 
I'm looking for light conversation, deep discussions and everything in between. 
Let's talk about fantasies, fetishes, and deep thoughts that make us 'tick'.
I'm hoping for a multi dimensional woman who can enlighten and arouse my senses.

Hello! My husband and I just moved to the Tacoma area a couple of weeks ago from the South. He's 23 and I'm 25. We don't have any kids, and don't plan on any at all. So far we like it a lot here in Washington. The biggest thing we miss about home is our close-knit group of friends. It was us, another married couple, and three other guys. We are all complete nerds!
We are looking for a couple of equally nerdy friends that can show us around town, binge watch Netflix, play PC games, jam, or grab a few beers with us. We have a very solid marriage, so if you hang out with one of us, the other one is bound to be there, too. We really miss our friends, but now we're all living about 2,500 miles apart. We need some people to fill the void and hang out with us.

Husband's into casual PC gaming (Fallout, Team Fortress, Borderlands, Minecraft, Pokemon emulators, etc.), he is also a musician (indie singer/songwriter, guitar, and drums), and likes to watch anime (HunterxHunter, Attack on Titan, Fullmetal Alchemist, etc). We both like Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, bonfires, and philosophical conversations.

I usually get along with guys better than girls since I'm so used to being around them because of our old group of friends. I LOVE Harry Potter. I have a large HP tattoo on my leg. I enjoy watching whatever anime happens to be on, and I like watching my husband play games (the only games I play are The Sims and Minecraft lol..). I also color often in those art therapy coloring books. I love my cat, coffee, Game of Thrones, and The Walking Dead. I will be very shy until I really get to know someone. My husband is the talker of the two of us.

So...if you wouldn't mind adding two more people into your nerdy group of friends, let's hang out if you'd like to talk about music, anime, movies, books, beer, games, food, places to go, and things to do.

Ok.... this sucks. Working and having nobody to talk to and having way too much time on my hands.... Come on quittin time!!!!

So a little about me I am in my early 30's, white, athletic, work out alot, love the out doors and enjoying what nature has to offer. I am also attached with one kid. She doesnt like to text and told me to find some one else to text so...... here I am. Good ol Craigslist. lol but Im Not sure any body even looks here any more for a social environment but hey, I'll give it a shot anyways. :-) I am new to the Olympia area and have been here for about a year and am looking to start expanding my social circle and meet new people out side of the gym and work who are local and are also looking to make new friends. Dont really have too many friends right now around Olympia and with my work schedule and my kid its hard to find the time to go out and socialize and meet new people. :-/

So what am I looking for?? Hhmmm..... just any body who wants to talk. Looks dont matter. I think the out side is just a disguise anyways. Its not what you look like, its who you are so Dont let the fact that I work out detour you because I am not shallow. I'll be friends with any one as long as you can hold a conversation with more than one letter. :-/

So yeah... if you wanna chat and see if we click hit me up! I have nothing but time. We can talk about any thing. :-)
If this ad is still up Im still lookin! means I havent found any body I connect with yet. Im just looking for one person who is local and may have similar interests and looking for a bff.

Heya! I've just been given a heaping helping of free time and I've been thinking about getting back into Final Fantasy 14. Unfortunately all of my old friends stopped playing it and the game is kind of a bummer to play by myself.

So if you're looking for a cool new friend, ping me with your server details! If you're local, cool! If you're not, also cool! I'm not really looking for anything specific, I'm just bored. Yay!

I am a plus sized woman working my way down in size..I have lost 25 lbs since mid january and plan on keeping it up.

I have a membership at planet fitness and feel like If I had a workout buddy whose company I enjoy I might be motivated to go more often. I want to be outdoors more too but the weather....I have unlimited guest passes but another member would be awesome. 

I am fun, a professional tech geek, I can be flirty and joke around a lot or be serious.

My former work wife and I have just gone through a painful separation. She and her real world husband moved away, and to add insult to injury, she took a job that prevents her from emailing throughout the day. 

As you might imagine, I'm in horrible pain. Really bad. Really. I'm also pretty bored. 

And, I feel like all of these hours suddenly filled with work could are wasted when I could be talking to you (yes you!). So, send me an email. Let's chat. I'm a fairly good conversationalist, I won't leave you hanging and I'm totally sane.

I'm more comfortable having woman friends, maybe its because you can open up to woman it ways that you just cant to your guy friends. As time has been slowing moving down that ever changing road, I haven't been in contact with my friends of the past.

An odd request! I hope it grabbed your attention (whoever you are) 
35m with various interests has reached a turning point in my life where I must choose a path before me...there are so many. I never had a father figure or anyone to look up to and even now have no role models. I have always found my way through bad and good alone but I recognize this is not the way to go through life. 

So many groups, so many doors, so many families and yet I dont feel I belong anywhere, with no support moving forward has become a struggle and this is only the first step I see possible at this point!

I am an open book (its a long an interesting one!) myriad of talents, skills, hobbies and experiences that i wish to share with anyone who will listen :) 

open to physical relationships average body type pics can be exchanged but looking for something meaningful...maybe similar successful jack of all trades master of none. 

I do have a small family that i built but I am the support...I need a higher ceiling.

I am in my 30s, but I am pretty open to all ages... just as long as looking at you doesn't make me feel old. ;)
I don't have kids, but it's cool if you do. Just don't bring them to anything. (This is a joke too, but two wink emoticons seemed excessive in the first two lines).
I am partnered long term, but he's not really into socializing... so you will mostly just get me. I don't mind hanging out with couples or single people though.
Mostly I am looking for another woman or a small group of women who want to get together and just chat over drinks or dinner. It would be great to see live music (from The Tractor to the Symphony) or go to events like the Fremont Moisture Festival (it's coming up soon!). 
I am pretty mellow though I can get fired up about politics and tend not to keep my opinion to myself. But... I try to make up for that by being a good listener.
It's hard to shock me unless it comes to the mistreatment of others and/or bigotry, in which case, be on your way! 
I get along best with people who are direct, honest, open-minded, and caring. I also love people who are into traveling and/or talking about traveling.
Downtown Seattle or the surrounding areas would be best for me (like Queen Anne, Capitol Hill, Ballard, Fremont, Wallingford, Magnolia, Greenwood, etc.). I am open to people from other areas of course, if you don't mind coming in to the city. I am just not much of a driver.

I'm looking for some flirty and risque chat today. Kinda burned out on the dating scene, but feeling that ""mood"" on my mind today. I'd love to chat with someone to get the blood pumping, have a little flirty or even naughty chit chat (at your discretion), and make my work day slide on by.

I'm in my 40's. Not necessarily interested in meeting, just a fun chit chat.

Needing to find that close, personal friend that can offer a kind ear. One I can message / text /email and vent about everyday life. Someone that I can grab coffee or lunch with as time permits. Someone I can be the same to, that lets us both escape without the pressures that our normal, day-to-day life & significant others. Open to where it goes.

You - email me, tell me about you and what you'd like to find. Include email / kik / text if you want.

Good morning, afternoon, evening (whichever applies to you). I've posted several times on here with no luck. I'm looking to just have a chat partner, someone to help me pass the time through the day. I travel for work (something to chat about?) with my work which is quite unique. I'm not looking to meet up or anything like that. Just want to have a digital relationship with someone. 

I'm looking for a woman because all men want to talk about it sports it seems. I like them, don't get me wrong, but would prefer to engage in more meaningful conversation. That's why I'm looking for a lady; they are the real conversationalists. 

I'm educated, enjoy a variety of things, and will at least provide my opinions. I like to take photos of my work surroundings and will sometimes include one of myself. Pics are not required though. Just want someone who can make the last hour of the work day go by that much faster or make me giggle on my lunch break. 

Ive got KiK (MrBaker1582) or can do email (or another messenger service I don't know about? Hope to hear back from someone! 😊👍🏼

I have a condo for four nights at Homestead golf and country club. I am hoping I can find a gal who would be interested in joining me for a few days of golf and relaxation. I am not a great golfer but very much enjoy the game and am working on improving. I thought it would be fun if I could find someone who enjoys golf and casual company and could use a few days out of the city to unwind. The condo is a one bedroom unit with kitchen right on the golf course. I would be happy to stay on the hide a bed in the front room and you could have the privacy of the bedroom. I was thinking I would go ahead and cover the expense of the room. You would need to pay your own green fees and pitch in on groceries. I enjoy cooking so would take care of that duty. Really all I am looking for is good company to share some time with and enjoy a few days away from the pressures of the everyday grind of life. I am a 54 year old male, been divorced now for around 12 years. I don't date much or even go out often as a matter of fact. Originally when i booked the room I was just thinking about getting away for a few days of golf but I got to thinking it would be more fun to have some company to share the experience with. I am easy going, respectful and have decent sense of humor. If this sounds like something that may interest you let me know. The room is booked for the 28th through the 31st of this month. I would be happy to answer any questions you might have and look forward to hearing from you.

I know I'm beautiful. I'm very outgoing and love to flirt. I like being out of the house and sightseeing.

I do have 2 girls, 3 and 1. 


If interested, send me a pic and a little about you and if i find you interesting, I'll send you one. To know you're real, put your ethnicity in the subject. I will not reply without a face picture as I pay more attention to it ;) That means no dick pictures, I can go watch porn for that lol.

If so we should have one together - I like mine extra hot from Starbucks but love trying local spots.

Love to listen to people tell me things about themselves and since you don't know me, you can tell me all your darkest secrets without fear.

We can meet with no information exchanged - I will show up wearing something that will identify me... If you are not ""feeling it"" then you can just get your coffee and be on your way. If you say, ""hmmm... he looks interesting"" you can come sit down. Easy as that!

Looking for a guy friend to talk/email and/or do stuff with. I work part-time as a property manager and find I have waaaay too much time on my hands, I'm bored to tears. I have a great sense of humor but honestly, have my down times. Again, being honest, a lot of down times lately. I'm older, but don't think or act old. Unfortunately, my body does act old as I have pretty bad arthritis so I can't go for long walks or hikes, things like that. 

Things that interest me: Playing pool, bowling, hitting Goodwill for fun, cheap stuff, antiquing, ferry rides, drives to small towns, Pike Place Market, train rides, chatting at Starbucks, going out for a drink and listening to music. I'm easily amused, doesn't take a lot for me to have a good time. I'm a nice person but have an awful mouth on me. Always have, always will, so if you're easily offended, I'm pretty sure we won't mesh. You: Don't be a mean person, a bigot, a racist or someone who no one likes. We won't get along for very long if you're any of those. 

An emailing buddy is fine with me, gets me out of myself and gives me something to do.

I have a nice car and a full time job. Recently got out of a relationship so I'm trying to stay busy and meet new people to chat and eventually meet. Not looking for sex. 

You: be normal. Be mobile. Have the ability to hold a conversation. Funny and honest are big in my books. No one over 40. Just don't think we would have enough in common. Nerds are cool too. Send me a message with a bit about yourself.

I don't hang out in bars and rarely drink, so I want to find someone adventurous. Who will go to a rave one weekend, and the Seattle Symphony the next, then hang gliding, maybe jump out a plane, zip-lining, the shooting range (I don't own a gun, wish I did), try archery, go kayaking, play pool at the seediest biker bar we can find, wander down random ally ways in Seattle to see where that ""one"" door goes, hike in the Olympics .... The only thing that's ever held me back from doing what I want is money and time. I have taken every opportunity life has presented me. 

I have trust issues and being short and small doesn't help. It will take me a little time to get to know you in public places before we go wandering off into the woods together.

Hey there =)

I'm looking to make a FRIEND somewhere in the eastside of Seattle. I like going on walks, chatting, watching good movies, cooking, baking, working in my yard, BBQs, snowboarding, playing sports, watching sports, and crafting! I don't drink or smoke, and I dislike weed. If you drink or smoke weed, that's cool. . .just not around me. I love animals, nature, and writing. I'm not much a traveler. I love too many things about where I live and who I am around now to want to leave. I recently started going to the gun range with my husband, and I really like it. They always have ladies nights, so it'd be fun to go with a gal and shoot! I've always wanted to go fishing. Maybe we could do those!? I am one of those people that gives hugs and not handshakes. I'm very loyal and honest. I don't like extremes -- political, religious, health, etc. I fall into the middle of most categories and I don't like arguing much! I'd rather laugh than bicker =D I also like eating. If you don't like food...we probably won't click.

My favorite color is green. I have two dogs. I still like cats. I'm pale and have long brown hair. I like mashed potatoes and steak. I love soccer. Aaaaaand I love being creative! Why buy something in the store when you can make it at home for three times as much! story of my life...

I'm looking for someone who is friendly and understanding, and who doesn't want to text for ten years before we meet up. I want to hang out =) in person is so much better. I don't care if you're black, pink, white, green, or orange. . ..as long as you're a girl. If you're a fan of Hillary Clinton, however, we won't get along =) 

If I sound like your kind of girl, give me a shout!

And see where it might go from there.

Happy early spring to my fellow Seattleites, I'm hoping I am able to find someone looking for something similar to me. I'm looking for my secret friend, that friend I get to keep to myself, email, txt, kik with. To keep me grounded, give me honest feedback, and to be my sounding board. I lost that when I moved here four years ago, and with my hectic life, haven't been able to find it since. Someone I can grab coffee or lunch with, share a laugh and keep a sense of clarity that I need.

Me - late 30's, white, married, sarcastic, a bit geeky, well read, educated and have a stable job.

You - near my age, enjoy sarcasm, looking for a friend to chat with, and able to carry a conversation.

Where it goes? Don't know, but open to possibilities. Hope to hear from you soon.

So here's the thing: I am trying to get out into the world as much as possible.

I too have been kept busy with work and school, but things are beginning to settle, and I have a feeling that it would be nice to meet new people. Who does not like making new friends?

I am pretty open-minded, love movies, and I am getting back into reading regularly. I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree, where I'm an economics/philosophy/political science major. Running is something I am re-learning to do (I was previously an avid runner), and I am training for a couple 5Ks. I savor the experience of food, especially Thai, where I cannot resist a good plate of pad see ew or pad kee mao. I'm learning to cook and I like comic books, so I have a few geeky moments.

I enjoy witty banter, have hobbies, and genuinely ask questions, so conversation will never be short.

I'm a recently single 34 year old guy who's just now been out again dating. And its been a while.. but I've noticed something disturbing. No one knows how to slowly passionately kiss anymore? Are we forgetting how to kiss? I mean I love getting to all the bases too (who doesn't)... but there is no replacing a nice long hot steamy make out session with light touchign.

Am I crazy.. or is dating in your 30s that different?

My name's Myfi! 

I'm a bit afraid of meeting new people, but I'm very friendly once I'm given the chance to get comfortable, I love to bake (and I will shunt many food-gifts upon you if you'll let me), I love tea , movies and animals(this includes reptiles. I own two. Be not afraid). 

I am generally relatively low-energy due to being out of shape and various other reasons, but if you have ideas for things to do I'm up for a fair amount of things! I am very blunt and fairly snarky, but I am an excellent listener and if you need someone to talk to about ANYTHING, I will sit and be a shoulder to lean on and will give generally sage advice upon being asked. I do have a long-term dedicated partner and we tend to spend our weekends together, so all of my free time is during the day (8am to 4pm) during the week. I also have the added benefit of having an adorable puppy who is SUPER high-energy and looking for routine playmates!

I do not drive, so relative closeness or a willingness to drive to me is wonderful, though I am equally content to make phone-friends or online friends! 

I'm not christian or religious and as long as you don't try to convert me I have no issues!
I am very libertarian and pro gun, so gun control supporters probably shouldn't apply. I'm incredibly prickly about being able to protect myself and equalize the playing field, as weak as I am physically.
I love all music except for rap. When I say all music, I mean everything from rock to metal to electronic to classical and opera to jazz and swing to disney music. As long as it's not Let It Go we'll get along great. I'm a bit of a budding audiophile as well!

I have a massive appreciation of nature which is a little ironic being that I've not been able to get out in it anywhere near as much as I'd like. 

The only thing I partake of to any degree is alcohol, and I'm insanely picky about it. I don't particularly have issues with anything you may or may not do, with the preference that if it's something illicit you not do it around me! I'm fine with pot smokers as well, but I ask it not be smoked around me(at least in an area where I would get the smell on me) as my partner is very sensitive and it would cause him to have severe nosebleeds :)

I'm told that I am a very giving and wonderful friend by what few I have scattered across the states and other countries! I'm fine with platonic snuggles and the like if and once you are(because who doesn't like to dogpile during movies, right? Especially when there's a cute pup!)

I mostly dream of raising tons of adorable baby animals, from reptiles to birds to mammals to insects! I am also obsessed with aircraft and many of the other Nicer Things With Engines that exist. Physics is good shit.

I'm seriously contemplating separation/divorce. We've been married for most of our adult lives, but there's no longer any intimacy. My wife says she still loves me, and will always show love in other ways, (meals, gifts, quality time) but can't bring herself to be intimate with me any longer due to past mistakes I've made that she can't seem to get over. I feel lonely and hopeless. 

Is it wrong of me for wanting to leave the marriage due to lack of physical touch, even though she loves me in other ways? Does that make me a self centered person for wanting to be desired in that way? Does that make me a typical male creep? Nobody is accusing me of that (yet), but I wonder how it will be perceived by other friends/family if I tell them that lack of intimacy is my main reason for leaving.

What are your thoughts?

HI,
Yep, I have resorted to Craigslist! I have found myself looking for new friends, Work out Buddy, Someone to do fun things with. The current ""Friends"" I have, well, I am not into the drama or being put on the back burner ALL THE TIME. That is not what friends do.

So, I am working on myself to become healthier and more fit, I am Happily Married and Straight. I am Caucasian. I do not care the color of your skin, You Sexual Preference, The color of your hair, Your age (within reason) or the type of car you drive. I am not looking for anything other than a Friend or two or Three or .... I am looking for friends. That is it. 
I am a Mom of two grown girls and an incredible special needs 8 year old son. I am looking for that or those friends that have kids or don't have kids. I am 50 years old, However I believe that is just a number, because I surely do not feel I am 50. I really enjoy certain 5K's 10K's and half marathons NO I am not excellent at it. I am just challenging myself. Last year I did at least one 5K a month, and LOVED being active. I am now pushing myself with 10K's and Halves this year. I am not saying you have to, I just want to know I have a friend that supports that. I am looking for that someone who wants to feel Fabulous and Fit and wants to have an Honest to Goodness TRUE/REAL Friendship. 
IF I have not scared you off by now, Please if you are serious, then respond, but if you are not, and just looking for a quickie, Keep on going. I am 100% happily married, and only wanting a TRUE Friendship. 
Thanks for looking Have a Fantastic Day!!!

I'm a sex addict and I admit it. I don't drink or use drugs, but sex is my way of getting high. I look for quick fixes with many sexual encounters, I need that sexual high.

I'm also happy to listen if life has beaten you down a bit. We've all fought with tough times and depression before; it gets easier when you let yourself have a support system. 

I'm into theatre, writing, many things in the geek sphere - games, sci-fi, Fantasy, limited Anime but I'd be open to anyone introducing me to more things....

Hey there!

The good news is that it's Friday and work is over for the week. The bad news is that I'm feeling a bit feisty and have zero plans for this sunny Friday afternoon/evening. Are you in the same boat? Wanna grab a pitcher of beer and play a game of pool (I'm terrible, by the way...)? Get jacked up on caffeine and watch ""The Revenant"" or ""Deadpool"" (I've seen it and I wanna see it again)? Grab a bite and a pint somewhere yummy? See if there's any good bands playing at a local pub? Start our own cult? I'm single, work in management, goofy, and a firm believer in the Oxford comma.

We are a married couple that is fairly new but familiar to the area. We decided to land here after our many travels around the northwest, buy a house and some land and get to living that American dream from back in the day. We have done fairly well for ourselves building what we can with what we have, and we live pretty healthy, motivated, happy lives as simply as we can. There are a lot of skills, and projects at work on our property, but we are lacking help, and people to share the outcomes with..
We are interested in meeting someone, or possible a few people that want to get away from the city and garden, or need some space to breathe the trees into your lungs. Someone who wants to explore some of our ancestors desires about self sustainability and partial reliance on community.

In just a few short weeks, I'll be visiting Seattle and while it won't be my first visit to the city, I'm wanting to expand my circle of friends in the area. If a friendship can start, great. If not, that's fine, too - this is just one way to meet people. 

Who am I? A college-educated lady who just turned 40 recently, though many will say I look younger than that, who spends her days working in a stressful office environment and looks forwards to evenings that could hold a variety of activities, all with the purpose to forget the workday until the next one has to start. Some nights, it's some form of visual entertainment with a glass of wine and perhaps conversation, if there's someone next to me. My tastes in movies and TV are in the action/adventure and sci-fi/fantasy areas, the same can be said for the books I enjoy most. Another night could be out somewhere that music and dancing takes the stage, something that isn't easy to do when you don't know the neighborhood. A few hours at a local museum or tourist attraction would not be unusual, either - there's much out there that I have yet to see or experience. 


Who am I looking for? The short answer is just to meet people who share any interests I have. The complicated answer . . . There needs to be some level of intelligence - I took the time to write this ad, your reply should reflect that you took the time to write, as in using words in sentences. There also needs to be patience - I do not live attached to my electronics, so it could take a few hours (yes, really, I do mean hours) for me to read your email and reply. Trust from me is something that comes in bits and pieces, which is another reason for patience - I've had too many bad experiences from rushing. Also, I will be very direct: I find myself more comfortable with men than women, but I do give everyone an equal chance. 

That's all for now - if you're still reading, thanks for your time and I wish you all the best in your search for whatever it is you're looking for.

Let's face it, at our age, there are a lot of us whose body parts aren't cooperating. My knees are killing me:-( And due to a drug given to my mother during her pregnancy with me, my intimate parts don't work correctly anymore. It has stopped me from posting in the romantic section. But I miss male companionship and affection. We both just see our malfunctioning body parts as a natural part of the aging process of life instead of a loss, and neither one of us is going to let that stop us from having a close, loving, fun, long-term relationship. I'm 63 years of age, 5' 5"", divorced, have waste long brown hair, a few more pounds than I would like (but not obese), very healthy (no high blood pressure, no high cholesterol, no diabetes). Things that I like to do: I love live shows of all kinds (plays, comedy, opera, concerts, restaurants with live music, etc.), science (especially archaeology, and astronomy), museums, the beach, Sunday afternoon trips, cozy warm snuggling by the fire, cuddling while watching a movie, good wine, ethnic restaurants and dancing. Hoping to spend some of the winter months in Hawaii or Arizona in three years when I retire. Want to visit Egypt and Italy, and would love to explore the U.S. in an RV someday (I especially love the Southwest). I am happy, secure and independent. I love going out with my friends and won't give that up, but miss the companionship and affection of a man. Most importantly, we both love to laugh! If you think you want to try to make me laugh, tell me something about yourself and send me a photo. I will send you a photo and more about myself, if I think there will be a connection (no photo, no reply). PLEASE no drugs, no alcoholics, no diseases, no smoking and have employment or a secure retirement. PLEASE live within 30 minutes of Lynnwood and be between 59 and 68. You may think I am very picky, but I like my life, so I am just looking for someone who will make it a little better.

I'm fit (athletic build) and into outdoor stuff (biking, tennis, walking, running, hiking and such) and into just kicking it. I'm looking to just find new friends and chat with people. I'm looking for another fit guy to hang out with, perhaps so we can do some outdoorsy type things.

I am a 24 year old fun loving gal who is looking for a friend or a group of friends to go out with and get close to!

Judgemental people
Flakes
Big egos *unless it's tempered with a great sense of humor
Sedentary lifestyles *I like to hike and see pretty sights. 

I'm really hoping to find someone I can go out with all the time and really spend a lot of time with and grow close to. It's been a long time since I've had a close friend and I don't want to continue to go on feeling the way I do now. I know there's someone out there for me and I hope as you're reading this maybe it's you. I look forward to hearing from you!

Hope your day goes well.

As the title says, I'm married (and plan to stay married) and I'm looking for a penpal. Someone who is intelligent, mature, and can write fairly well and fairly often. 

I suppose I could come up with a couple paragraphs describing what you should be like, what we will talk about, whether or not we'd fool around online, etc, etc. But what if we just exchanged some emails, got to know one another and let the conversation carry us along? Maybe we will hit it off, maybe we won't, but we won't know if we don't try. 
Email and let's see how it goes.

Take care. . . .

Moving to Tacoma and would love a gamer friend or two to hang out with online (and offline if we click).

I am in my 30s, work from home, a crazy-cat woman married to a newly-crazy cat man. We also have a gentle doberman pinscher who is a Lab at heart. 

You do not have to be a woman, you can be a woman at heart, but I am married to a very healthy, protective, (devastatingly handsome) husband who wants to know what I am up to and I love that about him. We do everything together from gaming to shopping. So, if we decide to meet up, he will be there for sure and you can bring a friend, too! We are very sane, safe people.

We currently play ESO, used to play DDO, and he also plays H1Z1 which I am trying to get sucked into but not quite working. We also play music together, and hopefully we will be rock climbing on a regular basis, too. If it matters, he is Caucasian and I am Asian. 

Drop me a line if you think we'll click!

I've always struggled with feeling lonely. I have friends,but most of them are the kind of introverted people who enjoy lots of space and alone time. I'm an extremely extroverted person who gets clingy and wants daily communication if possible. It's easy to find people to talk to,but honestly these people rarely ever stay. They seem to just vanish,then I have to go find a new batch of chatting buddies,and I'm sick of this ugly cycle. I wish there could be a constant stable group of people I had daily communication with,who didn't change and leave after a few months.

I definitely want more female friends, women understand emotions, and they are better at being emotionally supportive.
I'm 27, single, no kids, struggling to get my life together. Could definitely use someone to talk to. I would prefer someone close to my age so we are in the same sort of life stage (though I'm aware more ladies my age have kids and a man and I cannot really relate tothat,but I can't really relate to the 20-24 yr old crowd anymore either)
I struggle with depression,and would love a texting support buddy I could also meet up with occasionally for coffee and such.

Ok.... this sucks. Working and having nobody to talk to and having way too much time on my hands.... Come on quittin time!!!!

So a little about me I am in my early 30's, white, athletic, work out alot, love the out doors and enjoying what nature has to offer. I am also attached with one kid. She doesnt like to text and told me to find some one else to text so...... here I am. Good ol Craigslist. lol but Im Not sure any body even looks here any more for a social environment but hey, I'll give it a shot anyways. :-) I am new to the Olympia area and have been here for about a year and am looking to start expanding my social circle and meet new people out side of the gym and work who are local and are also looking to make new friends. Dont really have too many friends right now around Olympia and with my work schedule and my kid its hard to find the time to go out and socialize and meet new people. :-/

So what am I looking for?? Hhmmm..... just any body who wants to talk. Looks dont matter. I think the out side is just a disguise anyways. Its not what you look like, its who you are so Dont let the fact that I work out detour you because I am not shallow. I'll be friends with any one as long as you can hold a conversation with more than one letter. :-/

So yeah... if you wanna chat and see if we click hit me up! I have nothing but time. We can talk about any thing. :-)
If this ad is still up Im still lookin! means I havent found any body I connect with yet. Im just looking for one person who is local and may have similar interests and looking for a bff.

Hi!
I am looking to connect with a great guy on a friendship level that may have the potential to turn into something more in the future. I have a lot of female friends, but lack in the male department and I miss it! There are things that I dig that my girls aren't necessarily crazy about, and that I'm hoping to find in a male friendship. I'm big into sports and working out. I'm a competitive runner, do Yoga, weight train and intense SPX Full Body workouts. I love science fiction and horror movies as well. I'm a type A personality that is very direct and straight forward. That's a rarity in Seattle, so I'm not looking for anyone that is passive aggressive. I'm educated with a great job, fit/lean build, cute and very social. I'm confident and mentally stable. I ask you be the same. Since this is CL, I'm prepared for disappointment, so I'm hoping that there is that someone that will suprise me! Put ""friendship"" in the subject line or your response will be deleted. Preferably reside in the Seattle area and if you would like to send a picture, I'll be happy to reciprocate. No nudes or shirtless pics. Your response will be deleted right away. It's distasteful and classless. No married men or men in a relationship. No exceptions! Please be social, well traveled, around my age and athletic. I don't ask for what I can't offer!

Hi everyone! 

I've posted a while back when I first moved here, but no one really clicked with me so I'm trying again. I'm from Orange County, CA and just moved here last month because my husband's best friend lives here and we wanted to move somewhere new. I'm starting to notice that WA people don't care for CA people moving here unless it's for Army related reasons lol. I do adore CA with a passion, but I swear I'm not here to steal jobs or talk hours on end about how amazing CA is compared to here. :p

Back on topic, I'm looking for a few friends to become close with. As stated, I'm a pretty big introvert so big parties and whatnot aren't really my thing. I'm hoping to find someone chill who can have fun just binge watching Friends and eating an insane amount of cookies. I do have two kids (Ages 1 & 11) so I do enjoy getting out of the house once in a while for a movie, browsing book stores, and drinking over-priced coffee. My personality type is pretty sarcastic and blunt which can be a pro/con depending on how your personality type is. I'm into rock/alternative music, anime, hero movies/shows, Tim Burton, and enjoy red velvet cake more than the average person. 

Any feels of connection, feel free to message me! If I don't respond right away, it's because I had replying on my phone but I'll get to it asap haha.

I've wanted to try rock climbing for a long time, but I don't know anyone who does it.
I'm about 210-215 pounds and I'm looking for someone about the same so we can belay.
I'm a total novice here, if you are too we can do a class at an indoor place to start. I'm in Lakewood, so one of a couple of places in Tacoma would be a good bet. But anywhere in King or Pierce county is good; maybe further away even. I've got a couple ideas for places to climb once we get some instruction, but as beginners it makes sense to get instruction first.
If you're an experienced climber that's even better, let me know!

To be clear: I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A DATE AND I'M NOT HOMOSEXUAL. I don't care about your sexual orientation at all, I just want to be clear about it. THIS IS A PLATONIC THING ONLY. I also do hiking and fishing whenever I can, so maybe we can do that too if you're into it.

All my friends are couples and I'm tired of being the only one without a man. 

I'm affectionate and like attention. Simply I want a man to treat me with respect. I know most men just want sex. Yes I like it also but I don't want someone who expects it. If it happens it happens. So be brave enough to message and see what a real woman is like.

I am a 20 year old undergrad. 
Nothing seems to amuse me right now, but I'm searching for a friend to talk with. I don't know, show each other our souls, talk- I guess, intellectual stimulation. 
Some background information would be that I am a powerlifter and a bodybuilder. I love books, movies, dramas, and most things that pertain to the humanities. I don't party, smoke, or drink, it doesn't amuse me. 
Whoever reads this, the physical aspect of your appearance does not matter, I just want to chat and perhaps you feel the same.

Myer Briggs stated that I was ESFJ. I can most definitely agree that I am an extrovert. I honestly don't like to be stereotyped, categorized, or labeled [like how I'm Asian and I'm suppose to be *suuuuuuuper* smart with *almond-shaped eyes*]. Although I am full Asian, I'm pretty Americanized - English being my primary language, Vietnamese a second [yes, I'm fluent for those who are curious], and sarcasm/ebonics being a third [if you get offended because of this statement, then we can't be friends]. I would consider myself educated (learnt everything from Barney, Big Bird, and Bill Nye the Science Guy). I'm employed (if you count being a stripper and trap queen as employment), and I like to workout (and by working out, I mean lifting any utensils with food on it to my mouth). I find myself funny from time to time. 

On a serious note, I do workout about 4-5 days a week. I despise cardio, but do understand that it's a necessary evil. I love to lift! My squat/deadlift/bench are currently sitting at 215/260/135 for working sets of 5x5. 

I find that my happy place is in the kitchen. I use to hella count my macros, but I've gotten to a point where now I'm pretty good at eye-ing it and guesstimating. I know; cool story bro. I bake and sell cakes as a side hustle on top of my 9-5, so you know I'm pretty legit. I enjoy experimenting with food and see what other clean eats I can come up with other than eating the typical chicken titties and veggies. 

I'm looking for a friendship where we can get to know each other. I would definitely not be opposed to more if the sparks are there, but only time will tell. It's not about so much if you complete my list of standards, but more so the connection that I feel when we talk with each other. If you're a looker, that's a plus but it's not what always matters. I'm also confident in my personality and what I can bring to the table. I have always enjoyed getting to know people, their history, culture, values, morals, etc. 

As for education because apparently it matters to some people, I have a bachelors of science in biomedical sciences and a master of science in healthcare management. 

I'm not going to lie; it bothers me a lot when people do not get their homonyms right. It's just a pet peeve and an automatic turn-off for me. I'm also not into dirty talk, so sorry not sorry, but you're gonna have to get your Asian-fantasy fix somewhere else. 

If you've made it down this far, you might as well message me because *something* must have caught your eye. :)

Hey! 
My name Is Teara, I am 19 And have been searching for a chick friend since I moved here from Oregon (I was 16) because of how many schools i was moved to and getting my own place I have not found anyone, Me and my boyfriend and all his friends spend every day together but as you can imagine hanging with a bunch of stoner dudes means many things. While we still have fun and play video games and whatever they don't like doing things such as 1. Shopping 2. Dancing and being silly while blasting music. 3. going on walks and being active. And lastly... 4. They cant relate to my stupid woman problems xD I am not overly dramatic though so please if you love getting up in peoples business and starting shit, stay far away. aaaaanyways, I have a very alternative style, I have piercings and I color my hair very often. (visiting Sally's is a regular occurrence) I listen to punk rock, rock, alternative, electronic and some rap ( basically just no country) so hopefully you are not too into hunting and wearing Camo... or wearing Romeos xD I am also looking for someone to workout with for I am 5'4 and 160 pounds... not too bad but I would like to be 145 again :P Its been really hard not having a job and trying to eat healthy as well, soooo if you have any tips about that, or maybe know some one who can hire me would be nice too :P 

Please don't be over 25..
Please don't shove your religion down my throat (I believe that anything is possible and will talk for hours about where we COULD come from and how we all could be connected, but these are theories, ill never blindly believe in ANYTHING not even Jesus, so please if you are christian I have a billion theories why your god might not exist so get ready to hear it if you try to shove your ""faith"" in my face. 
Please love to be blunt and open
speaking of blunt...
Please be 420 friendly, you don't have to smoke it, but don't be hating on it either. 
please don't be an alcoholic or drug addict 
Please! Email me! I would love to know more about you! NO GUYS!!!
send me a pic and state your name and age also what you like to do!

I'm just here looking for friends right now. I am currently paying off a debt to society so I can put my past behind me and move forward. I'm looking for positive people to be around, better company than I have in here and more productive than the company from my past. I'm just your average dude, despite my current situation. I'm currently incarcerated in Washington state but will be released next year finally!

I'm divorced with kids, riding out the last few months of this bid. I have never done time before now, and I never plan to do time again. This life isn't for me. I've learned so much since I went down for this, and I'll be more than happy to share the details of my situation if you'll allow me the chance to speak to you.

My friend is managing this page for me, so know that the person you respond to is speaking on my behalf. I'd love to call you, just have a casual conversation. Take a chance ladies, you won't regret getting to know me. P.S. The phone call would be 100% free to you, it's my dime. So what's up, inbox me!

So here's the thing: I am trying to get out into the world as much as possible. My close friends moved away to different parts of the country, and the ones in the area have been so busy with their own lives. I too have been kept busy with work and school, but things are beginning to settle, and I have a feeling that it would be nice to meet new people. Who does not like making new friends?

I am pretty open-minded, love movies, and I am getting back into reading regularly. I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree, where I'm an economics/philosophy/political science major. Running is something I am re-learning to do (I was previously an avid runner), and I am training for a couple 5Ks. I savor the experience of food, especially Thai, where I cannot resist a good plate of pad see ew or pad kee mao. I'm learning to cook and I like comic books, so I have a few geeky moments.

I enjoy witty banter, have hobbies, and genuinely ask questions, so conversation will never be short.

Hello there! 

Just like what the title says....""What are you looking for in craigslist land?"" I'm just looking for people to chat with via email. I recently started work telecommuting from home so I don't really have co-workers to chat with during the day. 

I'm open to chat about anything. I usually like to keep my conversations positive so I'm looking for the same. Some of my interests are movies, T.V shows, fine art, music, trying different food, board games and taking long road trips. 

All I ask is for your emails to be more than one or two sentences long. It can be a short paragraph of some thought that came through your mind....but no ""text conversation"" with 1-2 lines. Also, please be between 28-38.

Thank you for reading this and I wish you well in your search if my ad isn't what you're looking for.

I disagree, body type has to be relevant to a point.

Just for the sake of argument, if I was looking for a friend to sit and watch movies all night, no, body type is less important, but if I am looking for a athletic friend, one who can rock climb, run a cross country course, some activities just don't mesh, like you do with guys. 

I think the children thing is irrelevant tho. hahaha

For the record, I read these god damn things for entertainment value only. I have yet to see or read a post that made me feel the need to contact someone. 

I think if people want someone to be interested, they should put the details on the table, its only logical to explain who you are, what you are, what you want, what you expect. 
And, if you are fat, just say it, don't sugar coat it. It's not like the person you're lying to isn't gonna find out.... False info is a sure fire way to end the trust factor.

Hi I'm licensed cosmetologist looking to expand on my skill set. Now I've been licensed and practicing for 8+ years now and every so often we in the beauty industry need to refresh our skills. So to the point. I'm looking to do more waxing services. Specifically Brazilians also know as ""Brozilian"", ""Manzilian"", ""Boyzilian"" etc. This service normally runs at a starting price of $45 for a partial (just the front area) and $65 for a full (everything). Because you'd be helping me out I'd ask for $30. And that's just to cover the wax and travel (gas is getting up there again). This is completely on the level and sanitary. I come equipt a table, waxing instrument. This is good for anyone that's ever wanted to try but didn't know who or how to ask about a service like this, your looking to get cleaned up for the warmer months, looking for a new waxing specialist, or just felt awkward/nervous about going to a salon and talking to someone about this. If you have any questions feel free to ask there is no judgment and not only are you helping me but you're helping yourself.

I will be in Seattle 4/8-4/10. I have a friend that is supposed to meet me there but his work may not let him go. So I am looking for someone in case he can't go. I know this is a long shot, but I was hoping to get to know the potential person first so that if my friend can't go, I will have someone to hang out with that I'm comfortable with. 

I am looking for a male of Eastern Asian descent to hang out with. Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, etc. I'll be completely honest--I'm unhappily married and this is one of my rare chances to go away by myself and have fun. My friend is a hot Asian and if I have to replace him...I'd like to replace him with another hot Asian. This will just be a platonic weekend, NO SEX, but I want to have as much fun as possible. I want to flirt, I want to feel pretty, I want harmless sparks. I want a bit of joy that I lack in my day to day life. 

The itinerary: I have tickets to Shen Yun. If you don't know what it is, please look it up. They're decent seats. While I'm in Seattle, I want to go to Shen Yun, the Chihuly museum, I want to eat really good Asian food, maybe go to the zoo, Pike place, and anywhere else you think might be fun to go to. I've been to Seattle, but I don't really know my way around. The music museum might be fun too...I've never been there. Chihuly is a must tho. And I will spend hours there. Hours. So you need to like these things, if not love them. Shen Yun will be paid for, everything else will be on your dime for your half. I'm not looking for an Escort, I'm looking for a cute friend. I'm looking for someone I get along with to spend the entire weekend. From breakfast until I go to sleep at night. And I won't have a car so you'll be driving everywhere. :D

A bit about me...this is where things get real. >.< I'm short, fat, and kinda cute-ish. I'm also really hard on myself. Lol. For real tho, I'm 5 feet tall, 197 pounds, white as F***. I love to laugh, I'm a blast to be around, but I can be annoying as hell. I'm honest, I tell it like it is, and I don't like games. I get attached to people easily so ideally we'd still be friends after this. Like I said...it may not happen but ummm...maybe my friendship is at least worth a shot? >.< 

You...Eastern Asian. Patient. Fun. Able to laugh at yourself. 28-45 years old. Don't be a prick and be courteous. Shen Yun is cocktail attire so you must have something to wear that fits this category. Don't ask me what, google it like I did. I don't usually go to shit like this but it's because I have nobody to go with, not because I don't want to. I'm really excited to go so please just be a decent guy. >.<

The reason I ask for Eastern Asians is because that is what I'm attracted to. Yes, it's just platonic. But I will be hanging out with you for a weekend and I would like there to be chemistry. Fun friend chemistry. Also, I like to talk with people about their background and culture and this gives us something to talk about. So if you're Asian but hate talking about Asian things...please don't reply. Oh! And if you have tattoos...plus. ^_^ But don't worry if you don't have any...lol.

If after all the mess above, you might be crazy enough to be interested, please 
1. reply with Shen Yun in the subject line. 
2. Include a pic of yourself. If I'm interested, I'll reply with a pic of myself. Then we can hop on one foot, cross our eyes, and continue the odd dance that is CL personals. 
3. Tell me why you're interested
4. Tell me one (or more) random facts about yourself.

If you don't hear from me 1) I may not be interested. Sometimes I get a lot of replies and I hate wasting people's time. 2) I may have a lot of replies to sift through. If you want a reply whether I'm interested or not, please let me know. A simple 'Please let me know if you're not interested, no harm done' will suffice. Trust me...If I'm interested you did not win the lottery. I'm not that great. Lol. So if I'm not interested...it's really no loss on your part. Please don't get upset. It doesn't mean you're any less of a man or unattractive. We just don't click. And just because I respond with a pic doesn't necessarily mean we'll get along either. Umm...I think that's it.

Hey there! Perhaps my ad title was a bit obnoxious, but I am just giving you a fair warning and should you proceed any further into this note, you do so at your own peril :) Okay maybe you won't fall in love with me, but I feel fairly certain that you will at least ""like like"" me (read that as though you were in the 5th grade and you're asking your friend Margaret ""you know does he like like me?"") or at the very very least I am certain I can make you smile and laugh. Oh and this is the platonic section so you shouldn't be here looking for love anyway!

What makes me so charming? God seriously I am not an arrogant ass, I am just trying to have some fun. Oh and my therapist told me to be more confident...okay teasing. About me...well I am reasonably intelligent, I am considered attractive in some circles, I have a real job, I don't live with my mother, and I am one heck of a great listener. And isn't that last attribute what helps to make a good friend? I have a pretty wide array of interests, I know great jokes, I write incredibly sexy short stories, I am kind to animals, and just yesterday I purposely went out of my way to help out a guy who generally bugs the shit out of me.

My shortcomings? Well of course I have some. I have a penchant for using the ""F"" word, but my New Year's resolution is to minimize that, I get distracted by attractive women in church and I end up missing part of the sermon, I am very unkind to bugs who scare me, but much like saying Fuck too much, I plan to re-visit my relationship with these scary bugs. I ramble, like incessantly, like I mean I can go on and on about virtually nothing, like take it apart and look at it from 7 angles and still have really said nothing...see?

Why do you care about any of this? Frankly I have no idea, I mean you're the one still reading this. But if you want a new friend and you can look past my shortcomings (a couple I failed to mention...I am flirty, I am sassy) well then we should talk. You can reply here or if you're feeling really adventurous you can send me a message on KIK, my username is warmancheery. I hope to hear from you!

I'm only posting this just to get some feedback from women on here (and men if they would like to add their input).

Ladies, I want to know something. Originally, I'm not from Seattle. I hear a lot of women in this City complaining about how most of the men here don't have the balls too confront them when shown interest. ""Men here are awkward, timid, etc"", these are just a handful of what I hear when I ask women about their experiences when it comes to dating. I'm aware that everyone's experience are different.

As a man, I have been told by some men that they would rather do things other than putting time, energy, and sometimes money on dates when there's a possibility that it may not work out in the end. 

In my opinion, consider men and women two heads of the same coin. I feel like both genders are afraid to waste time and other resources on something that may not last long enough, but like kids, some of us tend to point our fingers and blame the opposite gender.

I could continue, but I don't want to go on and on. I just enjoy studying and researching when it comes to human behavior and other things related to this kind of stuff. 

Feel free to drop an email if you would like to discuss issues like this.....or....something different (I think this should be in the Rants and Raves section. Needed to get this out of my head, lol).

Anyways, cheers!

Hello, I am a cynical, disenfranchised young man living in New Orleans, and I seek to move to Washington because of your cheap college, clean energy alternatives, plethora of tech jobs, legal marijuana, and agreeable climate. I am tremendously depressed and I feel like the change of pace might do me good. The difference between mellow and stagnant should get my wheels turning again. So, about me, I am a writer, an artist of sorts, I am practicing at two instruments and have interest in learning another two, but I wouldn't say I could play them. I like b movies, cartoons that are disturbingly deep for children's programming, I am saving up for more tattoos, and a new laptop, I play traditionally geeky tabletop games like dungeons and dragons and magic the gathering, I smoke pot on account of my being a nervous wreck and a slightly agoraphobic misanthrope, I like mellow music, I dress all in black if I can help it, and I despise children but I feel like someday I might want to raise some anyway. I like to walk around on clear nights and sit out in park space or woodsy clearings and stargaze, I am a futurist, I also believe in magic and the paranormal and supernatural and whathaveyou, it's the only field I would truly enjoy studying, but journalism and computers work too, I am spiritual but not religious, I don't sleep very much, and I want to start a text message correspondence with someone my age who lives in Washington so I can at least say I know one person who lives there, and hear about a slice of life and how it all works up there. I can tell you all about New Orleans, and I am also a great friend over text messages. Not so good at speaking, but I can type brilliant soliloquies with a thumbpad. It will be good to make some new friends, as my current friends are unkind, unsupportive, and as rotten as I feel to say it, they are just holding me back and using me. It is an unhealthy environment, so I am going north west and chasing my dreams with a fistful of dollars and two bags of worldly belongings. My lease is up in June, which is when I imtemd to head up, once my affairs are in order. Send me an email telling me about yourself and I will send you my phone number.

I am a 36 year old single male looking for activity partners/friends. I just moved to the area and do not know many people. I am not a creep or weirdo and have come across my share of those type of people. I am a normal guy in my 30's. I like to be outside as much as I can. I have a decent job, good education, good morals I am easygoing and fun loving. I like photography, movies, books, coffee shops, bars, occasional dancing, movies, music, festivals etc. I am 5'11, healthy. I go to the gym couple times a week and go hiking/biking in summer. I am a non-smoker and occasional drinker. I do not mind if you smoke 420. I do not care about your age, looks, marital status as this is strictly platonic unless the world turns upside down.

I should state clearly that I am not looking for a ""hook-up"" or any other sort of sexual encounter. Receipt of inappropriate photos, innuendos, or advances are not welcome, and will not be received well.

I am more interested in meeting a fellow CDer or a trans person who's been down this path and can lend me a hand in presenting as female. I have many women friends that know what I'm doing, but there's only so much they can tell you - after all, they don't have facial hair, broad shoulders, or an external appendage like we do.

I'd love to learn about all of these things, and get guidance where it counts. Beyond that, of course, is the friendship! My ultimate goal is to present as female out in public, perhaps at a nice dinner with some girlfriends and ""girlfriends"". We could hang out as guys and watch sports and then get dolled up and see a movie. Friendship is super important to me. NO SECRECY - if you're attached, it would be best if they knew because I'd hate for them to think we're fucking (because we're not and we won't). I know that Craigslist is a weird place to ask for this but I figured someone out there would be looking for the same thing.

Have a great weekend and I look forward to chatting with you!

A little bit hippie, a little bit nerd, a little bit fancy. 

If you recognize Kaypacha Lescher, Tom Robbins, Khalil Gibran, Terence McKenna (and so much more) we will already be in the same book.. if not on the same page.

420 friendly, sometimes psychonaut, I'm generally in touch with my spiritual side.

Single mother, one kid with autism. If you are not involved in or empathetic and supportive of the special needs community we probably won't work on any level. 

I work for a nonprofit, paint, try various crafts. I enjoy hiking (easy shit), pvotigraphy, reading, good food and better conversation. I'm a classic introvert with a touch of extroversion.. what is that.. an ambivert? Definitely sapiosexual hence the posting in platonic. It HAS to work for my brain before it goes any further.

Not HWP and I'm pretty ok with that.

Also, I'd hope to actually get along with you so we could have a friendship (but NOT looking for a relationship, I am already in one, that's why this is ""strictly platonic"").

Intelligent, educated, professional, WM with a truly wicked sense of humor and a flair for the erotic, seeks an e-buddy to build synergy and to resonate with.

I get bored as hell at work because I do the same thing over and over. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me out of the loony bin is chatting it up...texting, email, IM, talking on the phone...Hell it could be smoke signals (no, not THAT kind of smoke), carrier pigeons, or bongo drums and I'd still enjoy it.

What I'm looking for is to make a connection...To have that spark happen when intelligent conversation and flirting are mixed together with the rush of meeting somebody new. BOOM! Explosive?...Oh hell yes! I love it!

So then what happens, you ask. Well, I'm seperated and I'm definitely not looking to change anybody's situation while I figure out mine. I'm really not expecting that we hook up, date, or even meet for an ice cream sundae at a church social (I've never done it in a church, lol...Have you?). At the end of the day, I'm just hoping to find a gal pal who both enjoys some male attention and giving a guy that same attention. Anything beyond that...let's cross that bridge if we ever get to it.

So let's talk about you: A woman (sorry guys, nothing personal, I just don't swing that way), 40-60 (the age is just a suggestion because we're likely to have more in common...but if you're under 40 or over 60 and you think you're up for the challenge, then by all means). Race, looks, religion, occupation, politics, astrological sign, blood type, favorite football team, etc etc are unimportant. Marital status...that's an interesting one. I prefer you to be married or divorced...But, as with the age, if you think you're up for it, then by all means.

Turn On's:
A.) A woman who has a sense of humor as warped and irreverent as mine (You can laugh at almost anything).

B.) A woman who doesn't need me to carry the conversation all the time (aka isn't afraid to speak her mind).

C.) A woman with something going on upstairs (aka you know what synergy and resonance mean...or at least you're motivated enough to crack the dictionary).

D.) You're a fan of flirting and being flirted with. If you DON'T, let's not waste each others time.

Turn Off's:
A:) If you're somebody who thinks that bored people are boring, then carry your ass, sister. You're probably a princess and I dont need the headache.

B.) Likewise if you're going to be offended by my self confidence and think it's arrogance or conceit. If that's offensive or threatening, keep moving. There's plenty of gals who like self confidence in a man.

C.) Ditto on preaching about morality. If I want a lecture, I'll go to the aforementioned church and try that ice cream sundae.

D.) Nit Pickers. See A, Princess types for details. I'm not here to try and fix what's wrong with anybody and I sure don't need somebody doing it to me.

The rest of you gals, crack that dictionary, look up synergy, and drop me a line ;)

Hi, I am a mom of 4 currently living in Spanaway. I only have my 2 youngest full time as my 2 oldest have moved out. I have lived in Washington since 2004 but have seen VERY little of it. I dont know anything fun to do around here that doesnt cost me a grip in the long run. The only semi fun thing I currently do is a veggie garden but the weather makes that impossible usually. I like going to the movies but going alone is just lame. I have chickens and ducks and am becoming better friends with them than I care too, so sad and yet so true. I am in a committed relationship but he is always working and realistically we have NOTHING to talk about. Other couples we have been friends with always seem to cause problems in our relationship so I would prefer a female friend who does or does not have kids and who is or is not in a relationship who wants to possibly hang out once in a while or at least go out with me periodically. I have no intentions of our guys becoming friends, mine seems to have plenty. I have a few acquaintances here but they live far and don't have time to do much even if its just to watch a movie and hang out for a couple hours or do dinner. I am 420 friendly and would prefer a friend who is as well.

Getting the best of me

heavenly celibacy

to see you like relatively
instead of gal who should be belittle till you lose all sense of
reality

I'm looking for somebody to talk about life with. The world. Everything that's interesting. But none of, and i'm sorry for this, just girliness. You can be who you want to be. But I really won't bear to be with you if you are shallow and materialistic and all about shopping. Just not for me.

Once again, or still, i am looking for a place to have a crossdressing day or two near all to myself.

However, i need help finding a good place thats not going to cost me a lot of money, just the dressing part has some pretty heavy costs associated with it. So yeah, i dont want to pay hundreds and hundreds to do it. So i am asking any, friendly to cause, girls for suggestions or help. Maybe you know of a lady who needs a house sitter for a night or 2, or maybe you have a MIL apartment, and could use some money for the little trouble it would be. Friendly, Loyal and trustworthy are my main assets. Not messy at all, especially in femme. As being a house maid is part of the fun.

What my hopes are: Really pretty simple, I just need a place i can wonder around, inside and outside (private yard only) dressed for maybe one or two nights. You do not need to be there, or maybe you rather, and just stay in your room. I dont mind being playful a bit with a female, but i am not looking for sex. Being alone is just fine with me, but i will do small requests if asked. Maybe you want to see, or maybe you just want all the dusting done. Or maybe even just breakfast in bed service. Also watching the house for you is no issue. I will give you all my details, numbers adresses, etc etc and yes i can even meet with you before hand, so you know i'm not a weirdo, well other then the dressing thing. I will not touch anything yours, i'm not a nosy person by nature. I will admit it would take a little resisting to not look at your wardrobe, as i love looking at those kinds of items. But i would be mortified if somebody looked in my closet. So showing the same respect is vital.

I can pay a little cash, more for the perfect fit, or just the right spot. Or we can do trade for cleaning or something of that nature. 

Please understand the main reasons i like to be alone is, 1. I'm not really that good at it. 2. And it really does turn me on, and i do not wish to offend anybody by having to see it. I tend to wear pretty slinky items, and would like to walk around in the yard in a few of them. IF you have a very private spot.

Looking for some new friends and fresh perspective. I am 33 years old.I have spent the greater part of the last 10 years in a monogamous relationship. Out of that I gained two awesome kids. I have spent the last 3 years or so clumsily stepping in and out of the dating scene. I have been through my ""manwhore"" stage, my ""I want another long term partner"" stage and now seem to be in a ""JADED"" state. I have come to the conclusion that this will pass although it's going to take some doing on my part.

So, here I am on Craigslist. . . 

I am into Metal Music and play bass in a metal band that gigs often.
Thats not where my musical taste stops but it definately takes up most of the pallet.
I like outdoor activities such as, but not limited to Sking,fishing,hiking,bonfires, bbqs,biking,swimming,floating rivers and just enjoying nature.
I have a ""Moderately inappropriate"" sense of humor. 
I may or may not offend you but one thing is for sure. I speak my mind.
I am no longer the manwhore I once was and I am STD frrrreeeeee.! (Recently tested)

I am not looking for naked pictures or sexting.
I will also not turn either down 
I will not instigate these activities


I am an open book with many blank pages 

Im open to any type of conversation.

Hi. I'm looking for a buddy who would like to learn either of the two languages with me. I love to study on my own, but it would be so much more fun with another individual. 

French is fairly new to me, but I know a little bit of Spanish. Whatever level you're on is fine as long as you are willing to practice and learn with me. The important part is to maintain some sort of consistency and try not to bail on me because you feel it might be hard. It's not that hard! 

But please let me know if you do have this desire. It could be really fun!

So I'm gonna attempt to put myself out there and see what comes my way.

I'm looking for people who like doing THINGS....Maybe just friend, or maybe a relationship if it makes it that far. .I dunno.. what I do know is that I really enjoy my life. I'm 30 have my own place,my own cars, 2 healthy girls,a full time job in my career I've been doing for the last 10 years, a positive attitude and a positive outlook on life and a free spirit as well. I enjoy hiking or doing outdoorsy things, trails,BBQ, bon fires, mudding, go to the mountains, ocean, fish. heck anything to enjoy my free time. Yes it rains out here but we'll dry off:) I want to find someone that knows I can't give them 100% of my attention due to having a job and responsibility but wants to enjoy time together when it's possible and DO THINGS and get to know each other.... someone not wanting to rush things and not clingy and anyways I guess we'll see what happens

I'm just here looking for friends right now. I am currently paying off a debt to society so I can put my past behind me and move forward. I'm looking for positive people to be around, better company than I have in here and more productive than the company from my past. I'm just your average dude, despite my current situation. I'm currently incarcerated in Washington state but will be released next year finally!

I'm divorced with kids, riding out the last few months of this bid. I have never done time before now, and I never plan to do time again. This life isn't for me. I've learned so much since I went down for this, and I'll be more than happy to share the details of my situation if you'll allow me the chance to speak to you.

My friend is managing this page for me, so know that the person you respond to is speaking on my behalf. I'd love to call you, just have a casual conversation. Take a chance ladies, you won't regret getting to know me. P.S. The phone call would be 100% free to you, it's my dime. So what's up, inbox me!

Craigslist can be an exhilarating place. Let's explore that see how this story play out. . .. . .
I posted a post looking for a FWB. I did not expect much since I have posted multiple times and never had much luck. Never might be a bad choice of words. I have had some luck if by luck we mean, men sending me penis pics and fake women sending me invitations to various sites, and an odd amount of real women but the connection is not there or something gets in the way. Nevertheless I posted yet again trying to find one woman who will want a guy to fulfill her fantasies while she fulfills his.
You happened to be looking through the ads on CL and noticed a post that caught your eye, gave you a tingle, made you smile, enticed you to want to know more, and our journey began. The other day we began to chat. First it was a couple of emails that outlines why we are on CL, then what we like to do in our free time. Just some of the get to know each other chat. Quickly though as we do that the conversations also include more intimate details. We share what turns us on, what our fantasies are. You share how your partner will not give you what you want at home, and how you desire the touch of a man, the feel of a man's cock throbbing for you. How you miss the passion and desire, the butterflies in life. Most of all we share our darkest desires and secrets. As we chat the secrets and desires verge on what we normally only keep in our minds and what we think others would think is crazy but to us these stories, weaken our knees and put a mischievous smile on our face, making other want to know what we are thinking. 
Then it happens. I ask if you want to meet. You skirt the question in email a few times, trying to divert my attention with some sexy pictures. However I persist and ask again. You agree and from this moment forward our lives won't be the same.
We agree to meet at a local coffee shop. It's early in the day so that we can have a bit of time to chat. I arrive a little early so I can get a decent spot. Since I had just gone to the gym, I was casually dressed. I warned you beforehand I would be in casual clothes, and you did not mind. I had one a decent pair of black running pants and a shirt, fresh from the shower at the gym, and ready for a coffee. I was thirsty, nervous, and ready to meet. I ordered my drink and sat down. I took a seat towards the back, so that I could be alone and so you could see me when you came in. Although we had shared pictures, they were in bits and pieces of our bodies, and only a couple that had our actual faces in them. 
As I sit I get more and more nervous. I begin to think I had been had and you were not going to show up. Then in walks a woman. Her silhouette outlined by the bright light coming through the door. I tried to see who it was but could not tell if it was you. As this woman kept walking in her sexy outline caught my eye even more. Her curves were in the right place and her swagger was confidently sexy as she continued into the store. Then we caught eyes, and it was you. We both smiled a devilish smile when we locked eyes, the kind of butterfly's smile that we were both searching for. After you get your drink you walk over and sit down, asking me in a sarcastic way if the seat is taken. We laugh and begin to chat.
We sit for a bit chatting about our morning and other things in life, but in the back of our minds we both know what we are thinking. You glance over and catch me checking you out. You notice I am looking at your legs and slowly my eyes move up your body. You smile and lean in asking me what I am thinking. I laugh and sit back, saying, oooo you do not want to know. You slide your hand onto my thigh, gently rubbing, then gently gliding your nails up my thigh telling me you do want to know. I then lean forward and softly ask if you are ready. You pause for a moment and think. Then you remember for our emails what this could mean. Your heart begins to race, you begin to feel jitters that you can't explain, but want to explore. As you pause you begin to get warm. You look down at my leg where your hand still sits, you can see a bulge in my pants beginning to grow, and you need to know more, you want to know more, you desire to move forward. You look at me and tell me you are read. I then ask again, to be sure, this time with a little more of a serious tone, so you know I am not playing. You again look at me and say yes. 
I lean in and tell you that now the fun begins. You smile and, heart still racing, body now ready. I lean forward and tell you to go in the restroom, and bring me back your panties. You smile a little and sit back. Looking at me thinking I might be joking then you realize that the fun is about to begin. You lean forward and ask me, what will happen to a girl if she is bad. I lean into you and tell you to bring me your panties, and the naughty girl will find out soon enough. You get up and head towards the restroom. Your heart is now going a million miles an hour. We had talked about this in email but beginning to live it is another thing. You are in the restroom thinking do I do this or no. Once the panties are off you know we will pass a point and the rest of our morning will bring great fun, but you question if you are ready. Then without a thought you begin to rub yourself, to get a bit of ""you"" into the panties. You then slide them off and gently fold them up. You return to me and look at me and hold your hand out. I reach out and you put your panties in my hand. Then. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . ...

Your turn to get us to this point, what do you have on, what will we do now. . .. . .. . .. . ..

My life at this moment feels so empty.It's work and then nothing except to go home and be alone.
No kids to take to games or pick up from school and such things that people do.Sometimes it really gets me and i wonder if there is someone else who feels the same.Maybe we could encourage each other or motivate each other.We could become email friends or real life friends if we feel comfortable.
I am pretty normal and look happy most of the time and you wouldn't even know unless i told you!
I know this is the wrong place to look but it doesn't hurt to try! It could be just a phase i am going through and some distraction would help.

While I'm sure that there's plenty of other productive things that I could be doing, I'm hungering for some new human connection, a new face to help start the week off with on this cloudy Seattle morning. I've been going through a bit of relationship drama and would really like a fresh perspective, an ear. Are you seeking a little conversation in your day? Somebody to help pass the time? 

I'm an unusual, bald, bearded, occasionally charming, tattooed man who isn't hard on the eyes who has a love of witty banter, harmless flirtation and getting to know people. More than willing to share pictures for pictures. Let's chat!

Okay.. So this is going to be a bit different... I'm a Male, posting to see if anyone else ever feels his way. I'm in my 50's... Very well educated, well traveled,... Divorced... No messyness, never had any children. In honesty, part of me regrets that last part.

I have a house, a dog, a garden..... Friends, enemies too I suppose... I'm single, and I'm happy. I DO. at times miss having a female around the house.. Conversation, shared meals, ....panties in the laundry... Lol. 
I guess I am just wondering if there are any women out there... Who are similar... Single, happy, smart,... Who feel that life might be better ( cheaper too). If they shared a place with a Man. Sure... There are a zillion details and etc.... But can two adults live as friends and companions? How does the sexual aspect work? I'll be hinest, and tell you that Its easy for me to imagine an 'outside-of-the-box type of relationship...

Anyine care to comment? Please write No Boxes in the subject line. Let's talk. It's just a conversation...

Hey, thanks for clicking on my post. Hopefully this is the first step in making a new friend.. Unfortunately, my work and school schedules are crazy Monday - Thursday, so I'm hoping this will be a good way to meet some new, cool people. BTW, crazy weather we're having?!?! So, I know that this Craig's List and this section isn't really for platonic friends anymore; it used to be but I guess not so much now. However, I still have faith that there are still people out there, like myself, that are just looking for friends. Ok, I moved out here a few years back and I make some really good platonic friends on here back then. Unfortunately, they've either moved away to Ballard (you know some place so far away that they refuse to leave their new The Shire to come back to visit the old one) or they actually moved away (out of the area). Again just to be clear, I'm truly just looking for platonic friends to do stuff with. Absolutely no funny business. Period. I'm a laid back, non-smoking, educated, progressive, ""lefty"", black guy looking to expand my circle. Bottom line, I'm just looking for friends who would be up for grabbing a drink sometime, going to movies, running/jogging, soccer/flag football, working out, hiking, rock climbing and talking. Good conversation is essential; being able to discuss issues [and solutions] in technology, the environment, world events/affairs, non-commerical media, politics (again I'm a proud, educated progressive but very respectful of differing views). I know that's a crazy laundry list, but I'm truly open to meeting new, non-flaky people. If any of this sounds interesting and you're not a flake, please feel free to email me back. Thank you again for clicking and reading. I look forward to melting through the freeze and making some new friends.

It's been many years since I graduated high school and I have yet to make any new friends.

I'll be brief about myself. I am a college student. I am artistic at heart and love being creative. Fashion is my thing. League of legends is my go-to game.

I'm pretty petite, and of average fitness, but am really looking into improving my personal health and get into/keep a routine going.

In terms of who I am - 25, I have a great full-time career (meaning I get off of work around 4:30 and can only get to the gym about 5:15-5:30 at the earliest), and a wonderful boyfriend. I have a small dog (if you're interested in dog-walking as a form of exercise). Not too outdoorsy, but willing to try hiking.

I primarily keep my social interactions revolving around the internet communities I'm a part of but have been growing tired of the continual song and dance that's associated with online friendships. I've a desire to make plans with my girlfriends or squad for the weekend---see concerts, have a junk food laden movie night, workout (lift weights, go for a jog, hell I'll even give yoga a try!), play games or just hang out! 

I have a demanding workweek coupled with an equally demanding workout schedule but would love for someone who'd be interested in working out and having a good time! As the title stipulates I'm married with no kids, I enjoy drinking and am 420 friendly! I'm LGBT friendly and am Bisexual but not seeking anything beyond establishing a relationship with someone I hope to call my BFF(s)! I prefer someone closer to my age as well! Older or even a little younger!

I'll happily provide pictures of myself and my husband along with my name after a few e-mail conversations and hope to receive the same in turn! :D

Hello there!

I'm a 29 married female who is looking for a cool new friend or two to meet. Over the years friends have moved away or we've lost touch. So I thought I'd try Craigslist to see if I can meet a new friend..

I'm looking for genuine people who are also looking for no drama friendships. You don't have to have the same interest or hobbies as me because its always cool to learn new things about new friends. I'm not a bar fly but don't mind grabbing a beer and dinner with the girls every once in awhile. I love to throw dinner parties so inviting friends over is pretty common. 

The outdoors, finding new little places to shop/ dine, cooking and baking are a few of my interests. 
I'm a non smoker no drugs and NOT 420 friendly. Please actually be interested in meeting and not sending endless emails. If this sounds interesting please send an email and tell me a little bit about yourself. Thank you!

Imagine spending 2016 engaged in a reading challenge with a married stranger from another state. We each commit to reading at least one book a month. You read whatever you want, I read whatever I want. We share our book reviews with each other. 

We might find that we have similar interests, or we might find that our interests are worlds apart. Either way, we'll motivate each other to stay on our ""book a month"" pace and will learn new things along the way about each other and the books we're reading. Think of it as a flirtatious long distance anonymous reading affair. Safe and harmless, but enriching and adventurous at the same time.

I like all kinds of fiction - thrillers, romance, horror - you name it. I also like biographies and history. Historical fiction is great too. I'm not really into science fiction or self help books, but if you are, I'd still enjoy hearing about them. Maybe I'd become interested.

Looking to hang out and have some girl time. I love the outdoors,Love to hike and walk,Swimming,Love cooking,Thrift shopping,Movies,Live bands,Comedy, ect.....

Would love to get to know a couple new friends. I am non judgmental,spontaneous,outgoing but also socially awkward at first. I'm the type of friend you can call anytime and I will be there for you.

I am usually available Mon-Thurs during the day when kids are in school and can hang out later if we plan for it.Also available to meet up on occasional weekends. Would love to meet a active friend that has some common interests as me.Would love to start off with messages,texting and Facebook and meet up shortly afterwards. Also please be someone that wants to hang out 

Platonic only.Sorry no men. Age is just a number :-)

I will be going shopping tomorrow at Seattle outlet malls in tulalip. Anyone wants to tag along? If you can give feedback on clothes selection, it'd be a good thing. If not, it'd be good to just enjoy the company. I can help you shop if you are looking for a perspective.

Happy wet Sunday my brothers! Okay so I'm looking for a friend or two who might be kinda like me. I'm SURE I can't be the only one so here's a little about me so you know what I'm looking for. 

First off I'm a medically retired soldier with a small happy family. Being retired I'm a stay at home dad (which I love more than anything) just missing the brotherhood and need a more than just estrogen around me all the time lol. 

I'd love a bud in the same boat who would like to hang out, smoke a bowl or two listen to good music, watch some shows, fishing on the lake etc. Basically just get back to doing some guy shit again. 

I'm a very laid back, mellow guy with a liberal open minded guy who believes in live and let live. If this sounds like you, hit me up and let's get together smoke a bowl tell war stories and be happy. Washington is depressing enough lol. 

Only ask you be a vet, 420 friendly and a dad like me.

Hi,

So, as the headline states, I'm new here. Some of you need to lighten up by the way ! Anyhow, got a kick-ass job which is why I came, and I am looking for folks who may be simpatico on favorite things to do.

I have an outdoors streak, so people who like to hike would be nice. Love the city, so getting drinks and being a foodie is definitely good.

Not really looking for anything romantic, but hey, not saying no either. Just looking to assimilate, like I was meant to be here. Hit me up if you would like more formal, in depth introductions!!

Hi,

So I'm pretty new in town and I would really love to meet my next great friend. Not really looking for romance, just someone fun, outgoing, smart, witty, adventurous and active for fun and friendship.

I like outdoors stuff like hiking, in certain circumstances camping. I like going on road trips a lot and would like it if you were into the same. There are a lot of places I would like to check out around town too, so a beer drinking friend and aspiring foodie is a good thing too. 

Some deep conversation about the meaning of life, the sexes, gravity whatever would also be on the menu from time to time. Mostly just someone easy going, happy and fun to hang out with, be it at my place watching TV or smashing crab legs at the Crab Pot.

So if any of this sounds even remotely interesting, feel free to say hello. We can trade pics if you like, whatever. 
Gotta go get some coffee now, laterz.

Hello :-) Title pretty much says it all :-) I'd be great to have someone to chat with during the day and night via Kik, email, txt, WhatsApp, etc. I'm stable, intelligent, responsible, devoted, drama free, and I have a kind soul....I'm a great listener as well and don't place judgement on anyone. I would refer someone within the age range of 35 - 43. I live in the Olympia area and am free to travel up north around the Tacoma area, and down south as well.

I'm trying to apply some personal changes - putting self improvement at the top of the list now for now. Just got out of a relationship so I'm not looking for hook-ups, FWB, or anything fast-paced/intense. Long-term shouldn't be an objective but if an emotional bond leads us in that direction I wouldn't have any problems going with the flow :-) I think friendship is the most important anything so that would be ideal anyhow. Mainly interested in someone to connect with mentally - I have no problems going out on the weekend whether it's to a movie, out to eat, or for a few drinks, etc. I've got bikes, kayaks, and other outdoor activities but I've been in kind of a slump so I'm anxious to start enjoying those kinds of activities again. I'm normal, have nice/clean living arrangements, and you're not going to wind up in any strange or unsafe situations when you're with me! I'm athletic and have started my routine back at the gym again after a year off to help my joints and soft tissue heal up. I'm 6'1 225 with a lean build. I would ask you to be single - I don't want to have anything to do with being a homewrecker, cheater, or putting anyone in a position like that. I don't mind kids at all, I love them as a matter of fact, so please mention your circumstances surrounding children as well. Let me know what ya think.....please no spam from the guys, another post was complaining about it saying it was pretty common :-( I'm interested in white women only...not racist that's just what I feel most comfortable with and what I'm accustomed to. No drugs, alcoholism, any major dependencies, must be clean too :-) Thanks for taking the time to read my post...have a great rest of the day!

Everyone needs a friend and confidant sometimes. Someone to see and accept them just as they are. To provide daily inspiration, encouragement, and empowerment. Or maybe, just to listen. Whether you simply need someone you can trust and talk to or you desire honest feedback, I'm here.

So here's my story...

I'm 36 year old comedian that is also a stay at home dad because of a child with severe autism. I also do a bit of acting. My wife has encouraged me to seek out a best friend, due to the fact the last two I thought were that person ended up not having the qualities of being that.

I have more female friends than male, I just prefer it because I understand women (raised by my aunt and grandma) and am such a loving person.

About me:
- Funny 
- Loving 
- Honest 
- I don't believe in breaking promises 
- I'm am affectionate towards people I love (hugs and cuddles) 
- Love Movies
- Loyal
- I'm drama free (I'm a good guy, and my wife trusts me and likes all my friends) (Also she at one point made a serious suggestion about becoming a professional cuddler, she knows)
- No, I don't want anything more than a bestie (no side chicks, FWB, or etc)
- I always open to a variety of stuff, but because of the complexity of my daughter, I don't bring people over for her comfort.
- Love Karaoke 
- Don't Smoke of anything, but do socially Drink (If you smoke or 420, that's cool, I just don't)

There's so much more, but I want to hear some about you first. Be serious about wanting a bestie, I have friends.

I'm very good at my job and very efficient....

This usually means I'm also very bored much of the time! I would love to find someone for witty and thoughtful banter during the day. Even when I am working, I can keep up a decent conversation. 

One of the many things I miss being single (by choice) is the fun text and chats during the day. Of course, I don't miss the crazy, but that's another story! Well...maybe I miss it a little....

I am somewhat intelligent, articulate and witty. At least I've been told so by some pretty convincing lairs! We can talk about anything and everything. Also, I've had a full, interesting life and am a good listener. If you just need to vent or have someone listen, I would be happy for that as well.

One warning though. As soon as the responses start to dwindle off, I'm out. If you don't want to talk, that's fine, but don't think one word an hour will hold my attention.

This last bit is just added bonus. I have a very flexible schedule, and obviously time on my hands. If you happen to be local and we hit it off, meeting for coffee, lunch or something in the afternoon would be great! No expectations on that though. 

Email works as well, just not as fast.

In the end, I do hope to make a new friend or two. If you would like someone to talk to, let me know.

I have created my massage for the woman who is looking to renew themselves through relaxation, pain management, and reconnecting with the Earth. Let me take you into a deep flow of healing energy to connect your body, soul, and mind. Most of my sessions are a combination of Swedish, Deep tissue and some other techniques that I incorporate into your massage. My massage is nurturing, invigorating, and therapeutic, I don't rush my work or my client, since I only take a few appointments a day, I have several years of experience, but my biggest asset is my own intuition.

So what are you waiting for, book an hour of relaxation today.

Now I got your attention here are ten reasons you shouldn't meet me.

1. I'm clumsy and spill things at least twice a week.
2. Four out of five therapist say I'm sane one just happens to be my cousin.
3. I've never been in jail or prison.
4. I'm only looking for someone with large hands that will take all my money and spend it on someone else.
6. You didn't notice we skipped number 5 but your looking right now! Lol
7. I'm easy on the eyes that is if your legally blind in one eye and the sun is to my back.
8. I can make you say yes"" do you like chocolate""?
9. I can only please one person a day. Today is not your day. Tomorrow is already filled up.
10. I have a huge left brain lobe and a under developed right lobe which probably qualifies me for a disabled parking permit

Yes, that's counter productive but it's the truth! I live to eat, not eat to live!

I like being active so I can eat anything I want. My favorite food is pizza. It's so easy, simple and savory! Mmm. Guilty pleasure is sushi. All that rice is so bad for you, but sushi is so good! I like all kinds of foods and am open to try new stuff. 

Looking for someone local who feels similarly about working out and eating! I like all kinds of things - filled out some attributes (That was fun - see below). I miss spending time with a like-minded individual who enjoys the pain of a good workout and the glutinous rewards after! 

My interests are pretty random. I like any tv show or movie that doesn't require a lot of thinking. I want to learn more about UFC, so if you have some knowledge you'd like to impart, I'm an eager student. You may be thinking this girl sounds nuts. Well good! I am! I have a serious side too, but it's not that fun.

I have more face pics, and I also have KIK messenger. 

Work in the IT field and new to the state. Really just looking for people I can hang out with, whether its movies, meeting their friends, or exploring. I am very open minded, drama free, and good hearted. 

New to the area and would love to meet people who might be interested in any of the following or something similar:
- 420
- gaming
- trails
- movies
- pubs
- exploring awesome food
- movie/show marathons
- conversations about space, science, paranormal, and the deep unknown
- MTG
- Nerdy / Geeky activities
- Star gazing
- Shows
- etc

Pretty open minded, mainly looks for awesome friendship with an amazing connection and then we'll go from there. 

My interests and passions are a wide spectrum, whether it's movies, music, etc. Feel free to email me any questions or a simple hello.

My guy friend and I have made plans to hang out at the Royal Bear in Algona on Thursday from 4-6pm for a couple of drinks and a bite. You are invited to meet us there. :) Take a chance. 

It's simply a meet and greet. 
Show up at the place listed above, and find us. I've never been to this bar before, but I assume we'll have a table or a perch at the bar. Show up, look for the wacky pair--both of us with brown hair--then we can learn all about each other the old fashioned way--by hanging out over a couple of beers at a bar. 

About us: 
-Recent transplants to the area from the east coast getting to know the neighborhood.
-I'm a married female, not yet 40. I'd love some new female friends to shop, drink, walk or hike with.
-He's a single male, 36 (quite a catch) seeking friends or girlfriend... 

Come meet us. 

Friendship is always a possibility. 
Come out and buy yourself a drink; you won't be alone--we'll be there waiting to meet you buying our own drinks too. Cheers!

Hello all,

I'm looking for an email best friend so to speak. Someone who I can talk to about anything and everything. I have a wide range of interests and I always love learning new things.

Some information about me...I'm 40, college educated and a hard working professional.

Tell me five random facts about yourself to get things started. I'll do the same and hopefully that will spark the start to a great email friendship.

I'm 44 and just looking for someone who may enjoy walking at the beach, or along the Tacoma Waterfront, or Maybe Point Defiance. I have a dog who likes to swim and is afraid of everything that sounds like a Boom. She is my companion mostly, and with me almost always.
I do not go out to bars or clubs. I don't drink, smoke or do any drugs, prefer you are about the same- but I know that's a lot to ask- so just be aware of my personal preference- If you smoke or drink, I just do not want to be tempted I just got over all that. TY. I used to 420- so honestly, prefer NOT to be around it because it may be too tempting. Free from all drugs, including tobacco, for recently, about 2 months, and 4 months, before that. So somewhat just over the habits, and not desiring to go back. therefore prefer the same- not judging if you do- just do not want to fall back. 
Just a guy, who needs a friend sometimes, that likes walks, talks and maybe someone who love rocks and minerals a great plus. Pic for pic.
No I do not have a 9-5. I have hobbies, occasionally do yard work, for someone and fuel and things I need like dog food is about what is covered. Maybe some cash for get a coffee or something? This sounds pretty lame- I know but understand- I am no fat wallet guy- I think I want to sell my rock collection or publish a book- I just scrape by- not even a care really- except to find more friends I can just be friends with for now- sometimes I am sure I am going to get back up, and live- it seems I am looking for peace within, and then all will come together- I am generally happy and easy going. I have my ups and downs- (writing a book here).
Coffee is my only stronghold left. So if you love coffee then maybe do coffee and take a walk, in Tacoma- I am reserved, and have a few favorite places. If interested send an e-mail. 
I am in a place in my life where, a change may be inevitable. But still trying to hold onto what I got- and that may seem like little. I have a vehicle- but am not independently wealthy- nor otherwise with a lot of funds. That's why I am asking for a walking or chill out partner. Your place- ok. My place not. 
If still interested mention Opal in your post- my birthstone. Blessings and safe journeys, no matter what.
Always open to new adventures. I am outdoorsy, I know where to find cool stones rocks and minerals, in Washington- I want someone who could do activities with that sometimes includes digging in the dirt for Quartz crystals, and Amethyst, etc. That's really my favorite passion- :) , and my life is rather boring otherwise? it seems- on the computer too much maybe?
. I don't take any 'meds' for anything. Probably no one ever typed such a long deal. And well I only hope to meet someone great, who wants to meet a great guy for adventure, movies, walks, talks, chat, etc. See where this goes. My first one of these and well- May it work out better than I may be expecting- Opal- In your reply. Thank you.

Hello.

I am looking for a workout partner who is serious about getting healthier and stronger.

I am changing gyms and will be going to Fitness Evolution in Tacoma. I am following a new program that will lead to a more difficult one. I need a partner for spotting/encouragement/fun.

Information on the program can be found at http://stronglifts.com/5x5/

There is also an app that's less lengthy in its explanation of the program and includes tracking. It's three days per week.

If this seems like something you'd be interested in trying please reply.

I have severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, leading to Anxiety Disorder, Depressive Disorder, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. I haven't had much social activity in many years. It's quite common for me to not talk to anybody for a week or more and when I do, it's primarily to various doctors and therapists. So now I'm looking to meet some people who generally have a calm, accepting demeanor and would enjoy going out and doing simple things around town. 

I'm on a limited income, so I want to keep it inexpensive. We could maybe hit up some happy hours with cheap food (I don't drink though), or visit various exhibits - I heard there are a couple Shakespeare folios at the downtown library. There used to be lots of good local music that only cost $5-10, but my knowledge of that is several years out of date so prices may have risen. I also have a two-for-one coupon for a dance class at the Century Ballroom that might be fun eventually, except I think dancing is a bit beyond my social comfort zone right now. 

A couple of my passions are photography and the outdoors. So I would enjoy just wandering and taking pictures of the Seattle neighborhoods, or visiting some of the nice blooming parks and gardens this spring. There was a time when I went on lots of outdoor trips up into the mountains and out to the coast, but I haven't done much in recent years because I haven't had anybody to join me. I always found that going out into the serene wilderness helped me feel peaceful. I'm not into adrenaline sports and I prefer to keep both feet on the ground, but I often found myself covering 20 or more miles in a day over some rough and steep trails to reach the pristine areas that still have very little human footprint. I never did any overnight backpacking though because I never knew anybody else who wanted to try it, but that might be fun one day. 

I'm seeking friends with calm personalities who are understanding of my restrictions and social awkwardness. It would also be best if you have some physical fitness and can do the outdoorsy things I mentioned, though trips like that wouldn't come until later. I don't care about your race, religion, politics, (as long as you don't proselytize with those) or relationship status. For age, it would probably be best if you're close to me or younger. I haven't had the social experiences of other 30-somethings, and people always say I seem much younger than I am when they meet me, which I think is a polite way of saying I'm immature. So if you're willing to put up with all of this, write me an email and we can talk some more.

Hey there I am looking for friends who are also in their 20's who either have kids or love babies and don't mind my 9-month old son tagging along :)

I love spending time outdoors and enjoy fishing and hiking and would love someone who is also wanting to spend more time outdoors. It would also be great to find someone who is comfortable just hanging out at each other's places sometimes since that is often more practical with a baby! We could talk, play video games, work on craft projects, have coffee or maybe even some cocktails or wine. I'm still wanting to lose some pregnancy weight and the apartments my husband and I live at have a workout room if you are looking for someone to workout with too. If you are married or in a relationship my husband and I are also up for double dates, and if you also have kids maybe we could do babysitting swaps for each other :)

I don't smoke but it's fine if you do, I do drink a couple of times a week. I'm Christian and my faith is an important part of my life, but it's cool if you have a different faith or none at all. I'm the kind of person who doesn't get offended if someone doesn't have the same opinions I do. It can be fun to debate things sometimes, but I think its important to be comfortable ending up at ""agreeing to disagree"" and still respect each other just as much! I think that's one of the most important qualities I want in friends.

When I'm just getting to know someone I think I come across as quiet and reserved because I definitely have a touch of social anxiety. Who I really am though is goofy, a bit wild, adventurous, and I care about people deeply. I find joy in simple things and am not a hard person to impress. If you think we would get along feel free to reply and I will send you a pic :)

Good luck finding a more fun, interesting, open minded, easy going, creative, calmly driven, hyper-eligible and heterosexual, biped, humanoid anywhere this side of West Seattle! If you think you can, bring this alleged subject before me so I may learn his ways, or not... 
uhh... Bragging about myself is not my strong point.
Modesty is blindingly more noble than arrogance or competitiveness. 
However, I do probably need to at least explain and describe myself.
so here goes: 
I am the proud inventor of the SpiderWhistle.(c)
Spiders of every kind come 'a runnin' from all directions fast as lightning with one blow of my new and improved SpiderWhistle.(c)
IMPORTANT NOTICE: Don't forget to have plenty of SpiderChow.(c) on hand as it is NOT recommended to tease spiders. Remember that serving anything other than ""SpiderChow (c)"" brand Spider food may cause spiders to become aggressive toward the whistle-blower.
Children ages 3 and under ""should"" be supervised. 
Use caution in densely wooded, tropical areas near the equator. 
Seek medical attention immediately if / when a spider attack occurs. 

I'm a Licensed and Certified Professionalologist, but I try not to let it get to my head. 
Also a self proclaimed Intellectual Magician / Professional Musician / Freelance Comedian / Experimental Philosopher / Makeshift Psychonautical Neuropharmacologist / Perspective Expander / Love Provider & Receiver / Under-vindicated Malingerer / Emotionally Mature Subgenius / Eccentric Unobtainium Collector. 
At times I tend to become a bit compunctous in the profundity of intellectual confabulations, as my vocabulary is inexplicably breviloquent, and I have little to no comprehension whatsoever of the vast verbicullarly linguistic proclivities randomly strewn throughout the entire modern English Lexicon. In other words, I'm highly uneducated, so language is basically like, just a bunch a werds i ain evin tryin uh fill my brainz wif cuz iss too full uh poo ahready!
Oh yeah, I should probably also mention something about my ""Deliberate Tourette's Syndrome"" which I acquired while vacationing in Sub-Space-Zer0 via un-airborne imagi-pathogen-nation.
so, moving on...
If there's anything particular you don't enjoy about me or my ridiculous banter, PLEASE tell me, & lay it on thick too, I mean really make it sting, I can take it. lol...
Insane, how people really believe that ""words can hurt"". HA!
There's always room for improvement from what I've been told, but who knows... who cares, 
or not. Whuddoo eye no!
PS. Not into needing or being an emotional sponge, jealousy, control, deception, desperation, ridiculous expectation, impersonal tradition, arrogant narcissism, racism, sexism, fascism, or closed mindedness, so I guess that means I'm open to any of the above, because I'm just THAT open-minded. I'd even be down for some crazy-ass, whack'd out fetish shit that exclusively incorporated all the above, as long as we can have insane screaming arguments in public regarding the most unlikely subjects, accompanied by reverse psychology body language. 
Allow me to present a scenario;
SO FAR, THIS AD HAS ONLY ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF MEN, AND MEN WHO DRESS AS WOMEN, SOME VERY CONVINCINGLY, AS WELL AS STRATEGICALLY TRYING TO BAIT ME INTO HOMOSEXUAL ENCOUNTERS. I GET HIT ON BY GUYS PLENTY ON CAPITOL HILL, CAUSE I PROBABLY LOOK LIKE A BEAR, AND I FEEL FLATTERED AND HONORED AND IT'S A GREAT FEELING TO BE DESIRED, AND I WOULD TOTALLY KICKIT WITH THOSE DUDES LIKE PLATONIC STYLEE, AND BULLSHIT ABOUT BREEDERS. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY ANYONE WOULD EVER EVEN THINK ABOUT, LET ALONE CARE ABOUT ENOUGH TO TALK ABOUT ANOTHER PERSONS SEXUALITY OR DIET OR POLITICS OR RELIGION OUTSIDE OF THEIR INTIMATE CIRCLE OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS! ALSO, I'M BEGINNING TO BELIEVE THAT ABSOLUTELY NO SINGLE CUTE FEMALES IN SEATTLE ARE WASTING TIME LOOKING FOR LOSERS ON CRAIGSLIST WHEN THEY COULD BE AT A SPORTS BAR SCORING STUD AFTER STUD. NO JUDGING IF YOU DO, I PROBABLY WOULD TOO IF DOUCHE BAGS WERE MY THANG.

Odd request.

I'm looking for someone who might be willing to help me stretch out a bit. I am not sure why I'm so tight, but hips, legs and lower back are really tight. I can barely stretch comfortably on my own, hence seeking someone to work with me, helping to hold me in a stretched position. 

I'm prefer you host, but may be able to host at my apt 1-2 times a week. This would be during the daytime only. I'm not looking to pay anyone for help, hoping someone would enjoy helping me out. 

A bit about myself:
5'9"", 180, 50, in shape/athletic build, but not ripped. I exercise and play sports, work from home, I am very clean both body and hygiene. Masc, med body hair, normal, safe/sane, but fun, outgoing and sociable. There's more, but this should be enough for my post. 

If interested or have questions, please write back. Please type ""Seattle stretch"" in the subject line and something about yourself as to why/what you would like from my post offer as well. 

Have a great week!

I have plenty of time on my hands, especially since it seems to rain continually these days and that makes for not so much outside work.

Hello there! 
So I'm newish to Seattle. I've been out here for about a month and a half from Nevada. 
I'm in need of friends. People to show me around, the ins and outs of this amazing city and even just to get to know. 
I'm 23 so going out on the town is possible, as long as I'm not working. 
I'm a pretty laid back person. I smoke weed every now and then, I love animals and nature. And I like being active as much as I like chilling out. I love adventures. I'm down for whatever.
I'm a lesbian, but don't worry I'm not looking for any kind of romantic relationship at all, so you don't have to worry about that.
I'm a pretty cheerful person and I try to make people smile and laugh because I feel like that's important.
And in turn, they might make someone smile or laugh.
Well that's about all I can think about right now. I'm in the Seattle area with no car, but I can bus it.
Soooooo hopefully this catches some pretty cool people's attention.

I'm in Bellevue, would love to have someone hang out and watch a movie, popcorn, conversation. No other expectations!

I'd like to meet good people who live in Renton, south Seattle, Factoria, Newcastle, Kent and other areas within about a 15-mi. radius of Renton who are ~55 and up in age. Please be a reliable person who follows through after emailing, not so busy that you never can find time to socialize, and someone who plans to remain in the area. Thank you for reading the entire ad before replying to it with answers to the PLEASE NOTE paragraph below.

Are you looking for real, long-term, reliable friends rather than just acquaintances? I'm also ready to meet new friends closer to home who are kind and considerate to share good conversation and activities. How about you? Do you love nature and getting out into it? Art and music? Let's meet at a cafe for a conversation or get out for a park walk and chat on a good weather day and go from there.

People who are adventurous, will try new things and are curious about life in general are my favorite types of friends. My interests include almost anything that's outdoors in decent weather - good walks and hikes; having a good conversation; musical events; good movies, plants/gardening and public gardens; little road trips, and lifelong learning about all types of things including other cultures. Indoor pursuits like conversation over coffee, museums, dinner, talks, hearing music of many types and the like are great when the weather may not be cooperative. I'm hoping you share some of those interests and also want to meet someone who will share some of your unique interests and offers mutual support. I'm a non-smoker (you too, please) and occasionally have a wine or drink. We don't need any of this to have a good time, however. 

I'm a truly good person, have a sense of humor, and am a good friend who remembers birthdays, pays attention to what friends say, and tells them about news or activities I think will interest them. I'm also an empathetic person who will help friends in whatever way I can whenever I can. I'm intelligent, but not intellectual, have a spiritual side but am not religious. (No proselytizers, please) I'm reliable and look for other people who are too, as well as people who are kind, good people who have most of those qualities. Nobody is perfect, of course.

PLEASE NOTE: Please email and include where you are (city/neighborhood), a bit about your personality and interests, and days/time windows you're generally available to socialize. Please be close to the boomer age range and in the areas posted in the first paragraph above. If you'd like to send along your number in addition to a self-description to shortcut things, you can definitely trust me with it. 

If you're fit enough to get out for at least brisk walks, that would be great. I'm fairly fit for this age. I was born elsewhere, have been in the Northwest more than half a lifetime and have interest in meeting people from everywhere. If you're overly concerned with superficiality over substance, we very likely would not be compatible. Otherwise, I look forward to hearing from you soon! [Sorry, not looking to meet married people or couples. It doesn't generally work out that well.]

I'd like to meet/train regularly to improve my bouldering/climbing abilities as quickly as possible. It's so much fun to do even at the ""baby"" difficulty levels I've been limited to in the past, and I'd love to get in shape through such a fun activity.

Hi,
I guess I should tell you right off what I'm looking for. I've never done this so please excuse my awkwardness. I need a new friend(s). Yes, I'm looking for someone I can be intimate with. I'm not talking about just getting laid, it's highly likely that won't even happen, at least not until sometime later. I do however, need someone who would like or even need physical intimacy right away. Why, you ask? Well here's my sob story. About a month ago me and my girlfriend of about one year got into a terrible fight and she decided to end our relationship. Without being unnecessarily dramatic, I am completely heart broken. I'm not looking for a new relationship or someone to replace her. I'm also not doing this for some sort of revenge, she's already with someone new and I'm confident she wouldn't give a shit anyway. I am however terribly lonely and would really like to have someone to hold on to, and even fall asleep with on a regular basis. I am in my 40s, I am employed full time, own my car, and my home so I'm not some loser in a basement somewhere. I am not looking for any type in particular other than please be 50 or under, otherwise any age or race is fine. I will be happy to send you a picture if you respond to this with interest and one of yourself. And you're not a bot or a scammer! Please put something in your response that indicates you are local, real, and sincere.

Ok.... this sucks. Working and having nobody to talk to and having way too much time on my hands.... Come on quittin time!!!!

So a little about me I am in my early 30's, white, athletic, work out alot, love the out doors and enjoying what nature has to offer. I am also attached with one kid. She doesnt like to text and told me to find some one else to text so...... here I am. Good ol Craigslist. lol but Im Not sure any body even looks here any more for a social environment but hey, I'll give it a shot anyways. :-) I am new to the Olympia area and have been here for about a year and am looking to start expanding my social circle and meet new people out side of the gym and work who are local and are also looking to make new friends. Dont really have too many friends right now around Olympia and with my work schedule and my kid its hard to find the time to go out and socialize and meet new people. :-/

So what am I looking for?? Hhmmm..... just any body who wants to talk. Looks dont matter. I think the out side is just a disguise anyways. Its not what you look like, its who you are so Dont let the fact that I work out detour you because I am not shallow. I'll be friends with any one as long as you can hold a conversation with more than one letter. :-/

So yeah... if you wanna chat and see if we click hit me up! I have nothing but time. We can talk about any thing. :-)
If this ad is still up Im still lookin! means I havent found any body I connect with yet. Im just looking for one person who is local and may have similar interests and looking for a bff.

Intelligent, educated, professional, WM with a truly wicked sense of humor and a flair for the erotic, seeks an e-buddy to build synergy and to resonate with.

I get bored as hell at work because I do the same thing over and over. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me out of the loony bin is chatting it up...texting, email, IM, talking on the phone...Hell it could be smoke signals (no, not THAT kind of smoke), carrier pigeons, or bongo drums and I'd still enjoy it.

What I'm looking for is to make a connection...To have that spark happen when intelligent conversation and flirting are mixed together with the rush of meeting somebody new. BOOM! Explosive?...Oh hell yes! I love it!

So then what happens, you ask. Well, I'm seperated and I'm definitely not looking to change anybody's situation while I figure out mine. I'm really not expecting that we hook up, date, or even meet for an ice cream sundae at a church social (I've never done it in a church, lol...Have you?). At the end of the day, I'm just hoping to find a gal pal who both enjoys some male attention and giving a guy that same attention. Anything beyond that...let's cross that bridge if we ever get to it.

So let's talk about you: A woman (sorry guys, nothing personal, I just don't swing that way), 40-60 (the age is just a suggestion because we're likely to have more in common...but if you're under 40 or over 60 and you think you're up for the challenge, then by all means). Race, looks, religion, occupation, politics, astrological sign, blood type, favorite football team, etc etc are unimportant. Marital status...that's an interesting one. I prefer you to be married or divorced...But, as with the age, if you think you're up for it, then by all means.

Turn On's:
A.) A woman who has a sense of humor as warped and irreverent as mine (You can laugh at almost anything).

B.) A woman who doesn't need me to carry the conversation all the time (aka isn't afraid to speak her mind).

C.) A woman with something going on upstairs (aka you know what synergy and resonance mean...or at least you're motivated enough to crack the dictionary).

D.) You're a fan of flirting and being flirted with. If you DON'T, let's not waste each others time.

Turn Off's:
A:) If you're somebody who thinks that bored people are boring, then carry your ass, sister. You're probably a princess and I dont need the headache.

B.) Likewise if you're going to be offended by my self confidence and think it's arrogance or conceit. If that's offensive or threatening, keep moving. There's plenty of gals who like self confidence in a man.

C.) Ditto on preaching about morality. If I want a lecture, I'll go to the aforementioned church and try that ice cream sundae.

D.) Nit Pickers. See A, Princess types for details. I'm not here to try and fix what's wrong with anybody and I sure don't need somebody doing it to me.

The rest of you gals, crack that dictionary, look up synergy, and drop me a line ;)

Now that we have nicer weather and more daylight, I'm looking for some people to join me in the great outdoors. Day hikes, snowshoeing, ski touring, mountaineering, backpacking, etc. My main motivation for these trips is the wonderful way it makes me feel to be in a beautiful, pristine wilderness. To reach those quiet, largely untouched places I love, sometimes it just requires a meandering walk along nice trails, and other times it takes 2-3 hours of driving followed by 15, 20, even 25 miles of steep hiking over rough terrain. I don't go anywhere dangerous or extreme though, partly because I'm usually carting a bunch of camera gear! 

So I'm looking for people who are in pretty good shape for those longer trips, but are also fine with the simpler outings. And you'll have to put up with me stopping occasionally to set up a tripod and take lots of pictures. But hey, I have a high-clearance SUV that I can drive, and I'll offer to plan everything, so you shouldn't complain ;) Or if you want to take the lead planning and/or driving, that's fine too! 

I don't care if you're in a relationship, religious, or whatever. You should live near Seattle so we can easily meet for our trips, and we'd probably be able to relate better if you're somewhere around my age, say no more than 10-15 years apart. Other than that, just have a personality that's fun to be around! We can also hang out in the city sometimes, hitting up a happy hour or whatnot, and that might be a good way to meet initially, but mostly I just want friends who are up for lots of outdoor trips. Send me an email if you're interested!

I have two quandaries. 1. I am skeptical/paranoid/pessimistic about posting. 2. Which category to post under. 

I prefer to find someone married who would share the same concerns. She would be a a great discrete friend. A women who can blend easily and surprise you too. 

I want to flirt maybe do some sexting and share some candid pictures but I don't know if I would ever stray further then that? Most certainly, I want to meet for lunches or errands and play dates and text when our schedules don't work out. 

I am blue eyed, great body, look a decade younger, and ridiculously over educated.

away from the irrational madness trumping stale flat drums.

let us inflate our wet pulsing beings unto warm sun sparkling mounds.

contentment. in the bounds of our arms, our lumbering legs
our finger tips slipping, inhale sweet sustenance over our gaping hungry lips.

Hello, my name is Amanda and I guess I'm hoping to find my bestie.
Like most women, I'm very open, warm and friendly /mans I absolutely love to talk/text, lol
I have a very wide range of interest and hobbies including photography, hiking/neighborhood walks, shopping at the mall/thrift stores or antique shops, long road trips, mountain biking, jogging, movies/DVDs and just plain ol socializing.
I'm also very adventurous in that I'm very happy to try other people's interest too.
I have a career that I love and own my house. I'm a mom of an awesome 11 year old son that I have 50% of the time. 
I lean very far to the left in politics and even though I don't see how politics would ever come up, I just feel it's important to mention that I'm very open minded and believe we are all equal and so I probably wouldn't mix well with those who held different views(at least on the view of equality)...
I really don't know what else to say than that I'm a very happy person and just looking for someone to get to know and hopefully turn into my bestie:)

i got a lot of guys in my life. the last lady i had in my life i got kicked out because she treated her 17 year old son like crap and i wouldn't help ruin him some more. i'm not looking for a girlfriend/lover or wife. just a friend who we could meet up some evenings and talk about life and bills. you can come and complain about your ex and the kids or your boyfriend.

we don't need to know where each other live. we can just meet at denny's in auburn. right by the exit for highway 18. i like to go over there and get me some wheat pancakes and a hot chocalate. read my book sister blood by karen haber. drop me a line and we can meet another night or day.

no i am not retired and no i am not lonely. just everybody is busy with their own lives. my friend in lakewood is moving to oregon with his lady. i have just plum run out of chit chat buddies.

so hot chocolate and pancakes is calling my name. hope to see someone female.

Hello,

I'm not sure how else how to say this... but I'm a racist. Racist, tribalist, sexist, favoritist, whatever you call it...Pretty much anything outside of what a white Anglo-saxon male would normally encounter throughout his life while living in the states I see as unusual and odd. Perhaps it was how I was raised... Sad, I know. I think it means I haven't gotten outside of my comfort-zone enough... I'm 24, have been all over the world, including Thailand, Guam, Mexico, Europe, and there's still this underlying feeling that anything not familiar or foreign isn't seen as equal. WELL, that being said, I'm looking to change that. I've heard that the best way to overcome those feelings is to immerse yourself in whatever it is unknown - any way to alter to idea that makes me believe the United States isn't the center of the universe. I don't have the means currently to live in another country or travel for a while so I think the best thing to do would be to make a friends from another country, to exchange ideas, learn something from one another, see how the other lives, and so forth. 

Interested? Send me an email! Please include where you're from, a description about yourself, tips, anything you feel. 



Cheers

Hi there, first off I'd like to thank you for viewing my add. I'm not gonna post much info of me on here but I'm 21 and I live in silverdale. Simply put, I want more female friends. I am terrible around girls and I just want to be more comfortable around them. I never had many friends in the first place but I'd like to try and get more. Friends who would be down to go on random adventures, friends I can talk too all day. I would prefer if you lived in the kitsap area but it's okay if you don't, I'd also prefer you to be single. I would like a friend who I see being more than a friend one day. Anyways if you've read this far thanks again, hope to hear from you ladies :)

Intelligent, educated, professional, WM with a truly wicked sense of humor and a flair for the erotic, seeks an e-buddy to build synergy and to resonate with.

I get bored as hell at work because I do the same thing over and over. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me out of the loony bin is chatting it up...texting, email, IM, talking on the phone...Hell it could be smoke signals (no, not THAT kind of smoke), carrier pigeons, or bongo drums and I'd still enjoy it.

What I'm looking for is to make a connection...To have that spark happen when intelligent conversation and flirting are mixed together with the rush of meeting somebody new. BOOM! Explosive?...Oh hell yes! I love it!

So then what happens, you ask. Well, I'm separated and I'm definitely not looking to change anybody's situation while I figure out mine. I'm really not expecting that we hook up, date, or even meet for an ice cream sundae at a church social (I've never done it in a church, lol...Have you?). At the end of the day, I'm just hoping to find a gal pal who both enjoys some male attention and giving a guy that same attention. Anything beyond that...let's cross that bridge if we ever get to it.

So let's talk about you: A woman (sorry guys, nothing personal, I just don't swing that way), 40-60 (the age is just a suggestion because we're likely to have more in common...but if you're under 40 or over 60 and you think you're up for the challenge, then by all means). Race, looks, religion, occupation, politics, astrological sign, blood type, favorite football team, etc etc are unimportant. Marital status...that's an interesting one. I prefer you to be married or divorced...But, as with the age, if you think you're up for it, then by all means.

Turn On's:
A.) A woman who has a sense of humor as warped and irreverent as mine (You can laugh at almost anything).

B.) A woman who doesn't need me to carry the conversation all the time (aka isn't afraid to speak her mind).

C.) A woman with something going on upstairs (aka you know what synergy and resonance mean...or at least you're motivated enough to crack the dictionary).

D.) You're a fan of flirting and being flirted with. If you DON'T, let's not waste each others time.

Turn Off's:
A:) If you're somebody who thinks that bored people are boring, then carry your ass, sister. You're probably a princess and I don't need the headache.

B.) Likewise if you're going to be offended by my self confidence and think it's arrogance or conceit. If that's offensive or threatening, keep moving. There's plenty of gals who like self confidence in a man.

C.) Ditto on preaching about morality. If I want a lecture, I'll go to the aforementioned church and try that ice cream sundae.

D.) Nit Pickers. See A, Princess types for details. I'm not here to try and fix what's wrong with anybody and I sure don't need somebody doing it to me.

The rest of you gals, crack that dictionary, look up synergy, and drop me a line ;)

Hi there.

I humbly write this posting. I will be quite straightforward about what I am seeking.

I am looking for someone who values or appreciates art, or who can use some of my other skills to help me to get back on my feet. It would be nice if this person might also become a friend, and that we could cultivate trust and understanding.

About me:

I am a beautiful person inside and out, very talented, and I make beautiful art and music. I have always been very driven in pursuing my dreams and have run my own small businesses. 3 years ago however, life just changed. Finally, I came to understand that I was suffering from PTSD. I was suffering a lot and I didn't recognize myself. I spiralled downwards into a crippling depression. I was looking for help everywhere, and as you may know, it can be very hard to find support and affordable therapy, especially for anything related to mental health. But the good news is, I did find some answers and some awesome therapy. But it didn't come cheap.

I guess this is how the cycle goes. I am doing therapy and feeling greatly restored, but I am diligently trying to hold onto my peace. I took loans to pay for my therapy, as I was desperate - and now those loans are due to the tune of $5g. Yep, I should not have gone to a loan shark. Desperation can make you do stupid things.

I am starting my life over again. I am sober and well and getting my pep back. I spent the last 6 months painting for my own meditation. My work is beautiful. I am looking for an art lover/appreciator who could buy my art/or - connect me to art buyrers and help me get back on my feet. I can also do commissions. Other skills I can offer are interior painting and decorating. I am a great decorator with great taste. Another skill I can offer is styling. I used to have a men's styling business when I lived in LA - again I have great taste and am great at dressing men.

The reason I am trying this route here on CL is because I am under the clock to pay this loan fast. I guess I need some kind of an angel. I am advertising my skills elsewhere and in the process of getting my businesses up and running. But I don't have a lot of time, and also, I am trying to keep myself balanced and well.

I am beautiful, fun, funny, smart and a great person to hang out with. I have had an incredible life with great stories to share and I'm a very good listener.

Maybe there is someone out there who has the means and interest to have a mutually supportive friendship with me.

Please write to me for photos of me and my art if you are interested. And please only respond if you are serious. I am a real person and I have been through a lot. It takes faith for me to do this.

Peace and gratitude~

Im not licensed, but I enjoy relaxing and helping people relax. This is completely free, nonprofessional, and amateur but Im working on making it more of a profession soon. I am a very low key, chill, happy, and discreet guy. Looking for the same. I am comfortable giving full body or just focusing on one area. Maybe even swap if you wanted. If your interested just email pics, and stats. We will go from there. If this ad is up then I am still available.

I am looking to find a nice gal who has some mutual interests, and maybe we can develop a special friendship. We should visit today, perhaps over coffee or on the phone.

I also feel and look great and have nice ""feet"" and a nice V shaped upper body, and attributes;(smooth/soft hands) I workout regularly, about 3x a week, and eat pretty well to stay hwp. I am looking for perhaps a platonic female partner of any age for this. We will see about doing this weekly..one coffee, walks or massage ;) at a time, but no expectations. I am fun, funny, and down right witty sometimes, I've been told. Also, clean cut, nice, gentle, ddf and ""a genuine good guy. Put ur favorite drink in subject line! Pics would be nice!

I just like to get out and do some biking. Hiking is fun too, anything that we can have some fun, get some exercise and see the sights. Im not a hard core long distance rider.

I ride a commuter bike and its tough but the people on their road bikes are always passing me.

I'm 25, I get along better with women than men, I'm clean cut, open mibded, great sense of humor., compassionatte, witty, intelligemt, helpful, respectful, gentle, and I have a washboard tummy that isn't too bad to look at.

I don't cook however, not well anyways, I don't currently have my liscence, out of choice mind you, and yes I live with my mom, but that's because with all her health conditions it takes me and my father to tend to her and keep the house in order.

I'm looking for friends to start, maybe more. I'll be any kind of fruend you want to let me be.

Your pic gets mine, and a brief explanation of who u r, and what ur looking for is appreciated.

I am looking for a musician friend. I love music but I have no family or friends that are musicians. I have been learning piano, organ, keyboard, music arranging, singing, and music theory on my own. I know how powerful music is and I want to use it for good. I have dedicated my life to helping other people find meaning in life and the truth and peace they are looking for. I am not using music for my own entertainment, but to reach out and help others. I know the true spirit of music is one of giving. Everything I learn, I share with others. I have already been asked to teach basic music theory, piano, and voice on more than one occasion. I do the best I can with the knowledge I have. I would love to find someone that believes in me and the work I do enough to want to help me. I love to learn. Things are always easier once someone shows you how. You will find me to be a quick, avid learner and grateful friend. I am sure you will find working with me a very rewarding experience. You will not only be helping me, but many other people as well. I am very religious but I am not judgemental. I don't care if you are religious or non-religious, gay or straight, just please remember I am only seeking a platonic friend.

I have a variety of interests other than music. I enjoy hiking, biking, and photography. I have traveled to Ecuador, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. I am currently learning Spanish.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I'm hoping to find an amazing best friend in crime. Someone who is down to watch movies, hit up concerts (of all musical types), go shopping, go eat out at random places and of course is down for spontaneous adventures!

Also, if I had my way we'd be best friends with benefits. I'm talking drinks at a bar and making out. Movies and touching. Couches and kissing. I just want a cute, sweet, funny and ideally outgoing girl who is as open-minded as I am.

I'm shy so it'd be great if you were more outgoing or aggressive. I do have a bf but he is never gonna be involved. 

I'm very real- Bernie Sanders thing at Safeco although he was just here a few days ago (right?) Idk lol. If you're wanting to establish an attached best friendship with benefits, hit me up! Subject line should be your favorite place to eat in WA! (maybe we can visit there?)

Have you noticed how much easier it is to get to the gym when you have a buddy to meet for a workout? I am a fit guy in his late 60's who is looking for someone in the Everett area that would be willing to workout with me regularly. I am retired and prefer to workout mid mornings, but would consider changing gyms and workout times with a consistent buddy. One of the rewards of working out is looking better to myself and the boost in confidence that comes with it. Another is that I look better to other guys as well. All this gets back to better sex, which I would welcome as a side benefit if you are interested. You don't need to be in perfect shape to join me but just have a good attitude and willing to put some effort into it. Please respond with your stats, what town you live in, experience, availability, and a body shot if you have one. Finding a gym partner is more important to me than finding a friend with benefits. Thanks.

Hello,
I am a simple man, believe I am handsome father of one, and live on the west side.
I am looking for a fun open minded sexy woman. No games.... Looking for just friendship to start off with. Not looking to rush into anything. Let's spend some time together when we can, getting to know each other, have some dates, and just taking it back to the old days were people actually talked, not texted all the time. Getting to know you in the beginning.
I take care of myself, I expect you to also. I am not a work out buff, and I don't expect you to. Just know that natural is better than anything fake. God made you beautiful, keep it that way always. I do work out a few times a week, I love to walk, jog, and stay fit. 
I am Dominant if you can't tell, but I am the most gentle Alpha male you will come across. I speak up for those that don't have a voice, and I am always fair. But we all get lonely, and this Chapter I just wrote needs to come to an end! :-)
Some people are looking for their future baby momma, I am looking for my future best friend.
Again, I am confident in my looks.
I do not smoke and I do not drink Alcohol, and I do not use drugs.
Please only respond if you are interested, match what I am looking for and willing to talk... ok to be shy, I will help you out of that... It is CL, so I am not expecting too much, but do know I speak my mind, I am always up front and honest, but love to make my woman happy.

1. Don't waste my time, its valuable.
2. If you have drama, that's fine, leave it at the door. I don't expect you to be perfect, I'm not, just be honest about what is going on in your life
3. I want a connection, not just a friend, I want a bond. 
4. Let's always have fun, and smile even during the difficult times.
6. I do not smoke and I do not drink, and I do not use drugs.

Love and Lights upon you,

I don't live in Washington right now, but I will be moving there before the end of the year. So I figured I post an ad now and hopefully start meeting people before I get. It seems hard to find that special person in Texas, or maybe she just doesn't live here. Even if it is true, it still feels lonely just waiting for the one. I don't want to have to go to some club just to find someone, just not my style. Even though I'm 25 (still young from what most people say) I'm just ready to start a serious relationship and let it grow. 

I'm in the army so it would be great if you were ok with that and understand what I have to deal with daily. We all want the morning and night text, the only thing that sucks about is each other waiting for the other to text first sometimes. 

I'm a guy and like most I'm not going to lie. I've cheated, been cheated on, lied and made mistakes, but we're all human right. I'm not saying I'm going to do that, but like said I'm not going to lie and say I've never done that or ssy I'm different other guys (maybe I am and maybe I'm not different, thats up to you). Like I said earlier I just want a serious relationship that will hopefully grow. 

Nice to be with someone at home and watch movies with while cuddling, not the 2015 ""netflix and chill"". Maybe go out somewhere around Texas, like kayaking in the summer getting lost in a road trip, going to a museum or even a walk around the town. 

I'm not the most affectionate man out there, but I do love doing surprises. As long as you don't take it for granted, I can be extremely romantic when I want to be. 

With all that being said I have tattoos, use to have pericing before I joined the army, I'm mixed (with that being said I'm mostly into Asian and white women, only cause if you knew my background we would have an extremely mixed baby). Race still isn't an issue for me or age just between 18-30, I mean I am 25. I'm extremely nerdy, but in a good way. 

If anything I just like to make new friends as well.

Hi there,

Just trying to find some friends who are colocated to me. I've been living in the Washington area for six years now, but living in the Columbia City area for 2 years now. I'm tired of having to drive or bus up north to meet up with friends and would love to meet people around my age (31) to go around this area and up for spontaneous fun things: grabbing a drink, checking out a new restaurant, watching the sounders, going to the park. An extra plus if you'd be open to teaching me how to lift weights and like dogs (I have 2). I'm pretty book smart so I can help you with techy issues, or reading instructions on how to assemble IKEA furniture, or we could also just talk about how my hometown (Hawaii) is like.

I've been through some tough times the last couple years. I'm back on track and am getting my life back in order. The problem is most of my ""friends"" that I thought would stand by me, well, didn't. I'll be honest, I tend to work and keep mostly to myself but I'm more than tired of being alone. I used to have hobbies and friends but both seem to be hard to keep up without being healthy and having money to pursue. I'm getting more healthy and more money all the time.

I won't lie, I turned 50 this year and that probably has me feeling melancholy more than I should be. But I don't want to grow old alone and I seem to have a hard time, especially around here, trying to figure out where or how to meet new people and develop friendships. 

I'm not some kind of psycho, although I have thought about writing a manifesto. OK not really, I'm actually very friendly and can be fun to hang out with. At the same time I'm also kind of shy and can have a hard time talking, especially breaking the ice and initiating conversation. It sounds cliche' but it really is true that once you get me talking and I feel comfortable you may be sorry 'cause you may not be able to shut me up. 

I like lots of stuff food related....coffee, wine, cooking..... Also just about anything car related. I've had a couple fun ones in my time and I LOVE driving fast. I smoke an occasional cigar, sometimes very occasionally in the winter. I try to play golf, sometimes not very well but I enjoy getting out there anyway. 

I like to think I'm pretty amazingly perceptive. Somehow at the same time I seem to totally miss cues and tips when someone is trying to either be more than friendly with me or trying to get closer to me. If it's a distant situation I can read it like a cheap novel. But if it involves me I can be a bit of an idiot it seems. 

So anyway if you want to make friends with someone new and anything I said makes sense or strikes a chord then drop me a line. I'm honestly not holding out a whole lot of hope that this will work out but I'm taking the chance anyway. So don't let me down people!! Write to me!! :)

I don't know where else to turn so I guess this is a last resort to look for help on craigslist with strangers.

I am NOT interested in anything romantic. I'm leading with this because there is literally no point to you contacting me if that's your goal. Zero sex drive and I don't care how godlike you think you are, that isn't going to change.

With that said, I'm 31. In Washington for my second time, the first being 8 years ago. If I'm honest? So far I kind of hate it here. No getting the chance to get out of the house to meet people naturally so figured I'd give this a shot. I'm semi nerdy. In a house full of full blown underage nerds (my 10 yr old and my 4 underage nephews) so I can geek out with you, to a point. I prefer conversations that make me think. I'd prefer if you are 420 friendly as I really hate that every time I've smoked since I've been here it's been solo. 

If you want to know more, you know what to do!

I'm open to friendship with a woman of any age. I don't care if you are short or tall, skinny or plump, plain or beautiful. For me it's all about the ""personality"".

I'm not looking for a level of intimacy that you would normally have between a boyfriend and girlfriend at this point in time. I guess I'm hoping to find a friendship with a woman where we become rather fond of each other, where we both look forward to the next opportunity of spending time together.

I have no hidden agendas, ulterior motives, nor am I into playing any kind of games. I'm simply looking for friendship full of fun and laughter, and hopefully finding someone who ends up becoming my ""Best Friend"".

Please put ""On occasion I can see Mount Rainier in the distance"" somewhere in your email and let me know how far away you are from downtown Bellevue and the year you graduated from high school as a means of better identifying spam email from real email.

Thanks for reading this posting and have a great week!

Chris

I posted once before, but it just seems like anyone that responds doesn't intend on going past texting back and forth. I'm looking for a new hang out buddy. The weather is getting really nice, and I have absolutely no one to enjoy it with. Would love to meet someone to go for walks with, run around town and take care of errands, or just kick it with. I'm 420 friendly, so we can meet up to have someone to smoke with. If you're not into 420, that's fine my life isn't all about green. Perhaps doing to the casino or a bar for some drinks would be fun. I just moved down here and don't have many friends here. Would really like to have someone to spend my days with hanging out.

I'm an open-minded guy that is into all sorts of fun activities. So shoot me a message and lets see if we click or not. You can either reach me through email, but the response time may be slow. Or you can reach me through text at 2fivethree, 3fiveeight, 5seveneightfive.

____

The first: ""Wanted: Fairy Godmother - No Experience Necessary""

Synopsis: 

Hayden Parker, paralegal for Charles Abbot's Law Firm, is in a funk. She's educated, beautiful, and on the fast track to early retirement in the Bahamas. There is one big problem: she is also full of self-loathing, insecurities, and irrational doubt. Wishing for all the things she thinks would make her life better, she is caught by surprise when two mythical creatures appear in her bedroom one night. Transported through a black hole into parallel dimension, a dimension where magic is an every day occurrence, she soon learns that the only person she can trust is herself. Guided only by her intuition, she must solve the mystery of a centuries old spell before the magic that separates the two dimensions fades forever, putting both worlds in danger. 

____

The second: ""Employed By E.V.I.L.""

Synopsis: 

Fresh out of college Samantha Cartwright is headed nowhere in search of anything. Motivated by her significant student loan debt, she accepts a position with Enchantment and Voodoo Industrial Line (E.V.I.L). By the end of her first week she is filling orders for salamander eyes, bat toes, and dragon's saliva by the pint. However, as surreal as she finds the work, she learns that even magical companies have very real problems. Partnered with the rough and ruggedly handsome collection clerk, Blake, she is tasked with finding the source of espionage within the company. Soon she is struggling to understand the finer points of corporate politics, discover the company spy, not succumb to her budding feelings for Blake, and, most importantly, live to cash her first pay check.

Hey, thanks for clicking on my post. Hopefully this is the first step in making a new friend.. Unfortunately, my work and school schedules are crazy Monday - Thursday, so I'm hoping this will be a good way to meet some new, cool people. BTW, crazy weather we're having?!?! So, I know that this Craig's List and this section isn't really for platonic friends anymore; it used to be but I guess not so much now. However, I still have faith that there are still people out there, like myself, that are just looking for friends. Ok, I moved out here a few years back and I make some really good platonic friends on here back then. Unfortunately, they've either moved away to Ballard (you know some place so far away that they refuse to leave their new The Shire to come back to visit the old one) or they actually moved away (out of the area). Again just to be clear, I'm truly just looking for platonic friends to do stuff with. Absolutely no funny business. Period. I'm a laid back, non-smoking, educated, progressive, ""lefty"", black guy looking to expand my circle. Bottom line, I'm just looking for friends who would be up for grabbing a drink sometime, going to movies, running/jogging, soccer/flag football, working out, hiking, rock climbing and talking. Good conversation is essential; being able to discuss issues [and solutions] in technology, the environment, world events/affairs, non-commerical media, politics (again I'm a proud, educated progressive but very respectful of differing views). I know that's a crazy laundry list, but I'm truly open to meeting new, non-flaky people. If any of this sounds interesting and you're not a flake, please feel free to email me back. Thank you again for clicking and reading. I look forward to melting through the freeze and making some new friends.

I am a married 56-year-old straight man who finds himself in a weird and painful situation. My wife decided, without discussion, with me anyway, to open her side of our marriage. At least that's how I see it. I won't be more specific than that here. We are currently living apart and are in counseling.

I am not here to find women to bitch about my wife to nor garner sympathy for my plight. I am here to try and find friends to email with, at first, perhaps phone conversations, and, if we sense some sort of connection, meet face-to-face, share a meal or a cup of coffee.

If you're curious, physical and other attributes can be seen in the grid to the right. I am not comfortable with putting a photo here and truthfully, sharing an image isn't something that would happen until we've communicated for awhile. 

Other, perhaps more interesting facts about me include a 30+ year in a local industry. I live in a house. There are no children or any other people living here. I don't drink, haven't for a very long time and don't mind if you do (within reason). I enjoy music, especially the blues, and my tastes are broad.

Hi I'm Wayne a licensed cosmetologist looking to expand on my skill set. Now I've been licensed and practicing for 8+ years now and every so often we in the beauty industry need to refresh our skills. So to the point. I'm looking to do more manscaping/waxing services. Specifically Brazilians also know as ""Brozilian"", ""Manzilian"", ""Boyzilian"" etc. This service normally runs at a starting price of $45 for a partial (just the front area) and $65 for a full (everything). Because you'd be helping me out I'd ask a starting of $30. And that's just to cover the wax and travel (gas is getting up there again). I also offer hair removal for other areas(back, shoulders, arms, legs, chest, etc) This is completely on the level and sanitary. I come equipt with a table and manscaping waxing instrument. I'm mobile so the services are performed in the privacy of your home. This is good for anyone that's ever wanted to try but didn't know who or how to ask about a services like this, your looking to get cleaned up for the warmer months, looking for a new manscaping/waxing specialist, or just felt awkward/nervous about going to a salon and talking to someone about this. If you have any questions feel free to ask there is no judgment and not only are you helping me but you're helping yourself.

Hello,

I'm trying to manifest opportunities to build a life-long friendship with another queer woman. Maybe with two :-)

I am a 31 year old woman living in the Central District neighborhood of Seattle. I am married and we have one toddler-aged child. Our family was traveling a lot over the past few years and we returned to Seattle a few months ago to continue growing roots here and have the city be our permanent home base. While we were traveling, my two closest, local friends moved out of Seattle and so I get to practice putting myself ""out there"" and integrate the law of attraction for meeting people.

I somewhat like the activity of making friends. But with being the lead on logistics with my young child, I don't have the same access to real-world social spaces. I much prefer one-on-one relating. Mostly with people I listen, talk, cook, eat and laugh. Sometimes we get around to playing a game or watching a movie. In my time with myself -- which I cherish and need a healthy amount of -- I practice some form of art, listen to audiobooks (dystopian sci-fi, spiritual and sociological works), and watch shows from Amazon (right now, the ""Newsroom"" series). I would say I'm 50% extroverted and 50% introverted. I like having fun and being passionate about doing ""good"" in the world. I love playing sports and engaging with nature. I like doing things that other people are passionate about. Honesty/Authenticity and loyalty are very important ingredients for me in relationships.

I would like to connect with normal human beings -- who do not smoke :-/ By ""normal"" I mean people who have managed to resist or have undone (or are un-doing) all our limiting social programming. I operate on the premise that being racist or xenophobic isn't normal or natural. Any behavior that contributes to being disconnected or destructive to one's self or life around isn't normal. So while I am actively working on myself to meet folks with love wherever they may be at, I, quite frankly, want for myself a friend who practices self-care and has already done the foundational work on resolving their internal suffering. (It would also be great if you are available to relate in-person (in the CD) during the weekdays after 7 PM and/or early afternoons during weekends ;-).

If you feel intuitively aligned with the energy here, be brave and write me an e-mail.

Hello!
My name is Ryan and I'm a personal trainer trying to build my own, local client base.

I've been personally working out and passionate about health, physical fitness, and working with others in pursuit of their goals for over 11 years!

After working with friends for a few years, I decided this was a career path I really enjoyed and wanted to follow after. 
I've earned my certification and am now ready to start helping you change your life!

I specialize in weights/cardio/kickboxing/mma, much more geared to fun, applicable workouts to burn fat and build muscle quickly.

While I take an observant approach to help determine your current states and goals, I'm a very involved trainer and will do the workout right next to and with you.

Most of my clients prefer this way as it keeps more of a team effort than simply you doing workout with a drill sergeant yelling at you.

I'm listing several ads, trying all I can to get myself out and help others.

Please, don't flag my ads, competition is good for us all.
Please help support, or let your friends/family know who are trying to change themselves and their lives.

I want to and am passionate about empowering people to take control of their lives.

My workouts are fun, exciting, effective, and I'm excited to meet and help you realize your goals!

Please feel free to reach me by phone or text, email is also acceptable.
I have an open schedule due to training full time so 24hr gyms and schedules are even doable for night shift people wanting to improve.

My prices are extremely fair and I'm always willing to work with groups on price or buying a few sessions at once.
Please call, text, email with any questions.

Love and respect,
Ryan

Looking for weekend fun friend to check out new movies, museums, different restaurants and maybe grab a beer or coffee on a regular basis or at least twice a month.

I work a lot during the week and weekends have been really boring. Wanting fun friend to come with and do stuff with.

I'm outdoorsy, traveled, hard working guy next door, handyman of sorts, listener that could talk your ear off, was a quiet kid, I know when to shut up. LOL Some east coast sarcasm, realistic, not really religious or a sports freak or politics fanatic. I'm aware and keep up on news, it seems bleak though. Prefer goofing around with someone who isn't completely grown up, but is. Ya know?

All sorts of movies and food. Loves pizza and tacos! 

Anyone NOT have the Seattle Freeze?!

Hey there -

I'm still pretty new to the area and interested in making friends. The more friends, the merrier!

A little about me: I'm a pretty down to earth, nerdy, soft spoken, intelligent guy. I love to laugh and infect others with laughter. I'm also very mellow and a good vibes kind of guy who enjoys going with the flow. A few of my immediate hobbies including: collecting, traveling, exploring, bowling, chess (let's play!!!), cooking, personal blogging, DIY projects, crafting, computers, technology, learning new things, video games, music, thrift shopping, tea cafes, Reddit, and vegging out to Netflix + Hulu.

I like to think one of my passions is gaming. My favorite genres include RPGs, some fighting games (Smash Bros!!), strategy, action/adventure. I've also been playing FFXIV and BLOPS 3 on PS4. I also have a few other consoles and handhelds. I'm very open to trying a new games too -- whether it is a card, video, or a board game. I should also add that I'm also pretty 420 friendly and also very respectable if you are not.

I'm really just looking for someone I can connect with and call a friend. Not just an acquaintance but a real friend that can come over, have dinner, and talk/laugh about nonsense. We could also just hang, run errands, visit a new restaurant or just waste time. Kind of like those cliche friends I see so much in the movies. Ah, I am also open to a walking or hiking partner even though I'm not in the best of shape. I don't really know the area so it would be cool to explore parks, trails, etc. Road trips and camping is also something I would like to do at some point. Let's enjoy nature at its finest :D

I'm also gay so if that bothers you click that x button and move on.

Anyway, please be yourself and upfront. If that sounds like the kind of thing you're looking for, send me a line!

Cheers~

Itching to begin training rides as the weather improves. I currently have no one to ride with on a regular basis in the early eves and on weekends. It would be great to find one or more partners who ride at a steady, moderate pace looking to increase speed, distance and hills as we move toward summer. In-city with the occasional rural ride. I work downtown and live in NE Seattle, but can be flexible on meeting times and places. 

P.S. This is really for riding and not for hooking up...I'm attached.

I love music, art, jeeps (my new obsession, yes I own one :), fishing, shooting, adventures, hiking, and playing guitar from time to time. I love tattoos and wear a few myself on my hand, arms, kneck, etc. I consider myself a tomboy and absolutely love motorcycles (v twins, not that plastic crotch rocket bs) as well as old semis like Pete's and Kenny's. I love to cook and consider to be amazing at it. I'm out here for a fresh start and not to date or anything like that. I mean come on. Lol. I just got a out of a bad breakup and am trying to establish myself out here. I have two kids which means baggage and I'm by no means desperate.

I am 26, Native American, recently single gal. I'm stuck in a rut. I was once a fun, adventurous person, but the last year really killed my spirit. I've spent the last few months picking myself up and I realized I need to get away. I've always been fascinated with Seattle. So much diversity and I love the rain and cloudy skies. I'm looking to fly or drive up and explore the city and more. Maybe find a job and just stay there. So with that being said, I'm looking for a sane normal guy to show me around. Strictly platonic. Meeting new people/strangers has always been hard for me but I'm ready to try new things. I think getting out of my comfort zone is just what I need. I know posting on CL is probably the wrong place as I will probably get creeps wanting sex even tho this is posted in the 'Strictly Platonic' section. Well that's what my friends said. lol. As of right now I am raising funds for flight or gas and for a motel. I wish I just had all the money to leave at a moments notice. But I'm a struggling pastry chef barely getting by... But anyways, if you're fun, adventurous, sane, outgoing guy and doesn't mind showing a normal (sort of lol), shy girl what Seattle has to offer. Then let's talk! I am a very good cook but even better baker, so for your hospitality I could whip up something, lol. Hope to hear from you soon!


Oh yeah, I will be coming from Nevada. And I'm hoping this trip to happen within the next few months. Hopefully by my birthday which is in May. My life needs a good change by then.

I'm also not entirely sure what I'm looking for. I have a 6 year old little girl, who is the most amazing thing that I have ever been given in life....she's my whole world.

I'm only saying these things because I believe in honesty, being open, and never bsing someone. Is this drama? A little. Is it drama like the baby momma drama a lot of people have? Nope.

I just want, as I said, a cool chick to talk to, get to know, and maybe hang out with....and if things progressed, cool, if not, whatever. However, unfortunately, looks are somewhat important if things were to progress, I'm not really into the ebony or BBW girls....just a preference. For friends however, I'm down with anything. Lol. If you're married, have a boyfriend, live at home, I don't care....I would just appreciate some conversation, maybe some flirting if that's what happens, and who knows, lets just play it by ear?

With your reply, please put your favorite animal in the subject line, and if you'd like, include a pic of you and I'll send one back in my reply. I sincerely hope to hear from someone, though I'm honestly not going to hold my breath...lol, I'd probably die. XD

Ladies, I truly feel your pain. I just checked out what cl has to offer for you all and I'm trying to stop laughing enough to write this. People asking for massages, making out, and all kinds of other things to do while being ""platonic"". It amazes me what this place has come to. Everybody looking for a quick hook up. It kind of makes me a little angry because I believe in this as a place to generally make new friends outside of your circle, meet people that you genuinely wouldn't meeting your day to day activities. A way to get to know someone without any bias or hangups. 
Now I ask you ladies, who here is tired of reading the same old ""let's hook up"" message hidden in these ads? How can actual real people looking for real friends get a chance to do that? 
I understand that men and women think differently, and I know that more men get on here than women. But I'm taking a chance to see if someone out there is willing to try and make a new friend. I want someone to take that challenge and try!

Hi - remember what it was like to get butterflies when you received an email from someone? The days when ""you got mail"" were romantic and fun? Somehow that all got lost as emails have taken over our lives. Nothing fun anymore (usually). Looking to get that back - I want to look forward to getting an email from someone and get those butterflies again. Something to look forward to through the days.

If interested, please drop me a line and put YGM (You Got Mail) in the subject line. I prefer married ladies (more in common) but single/divorced is fine.

And I won't ask for your picture or to meet. Or send you unsolicited pictures of me. Just want to get that email feeling back again,

thanks for reading!

You have wondered what it would be like to walk this path.

You have read about this, seen movies and think about this all the time.

You seek someone to talk with as no one in your group of friends or family would understand.

You are married or have a boyfriend or alone and cannot get this out of your head.

Email me if you have questions about any of this.

I will be very kind to reply back and answer all your questions.

As ridiculous as this post is, at least it is honest. I realize this could be a ""bad"" post for platonic, but I am looking for a friend. Whatever comes though, is good. 

I'm heading down to Greenlake with my puppy. I'm going to walk him (training), to read, and to kick back in the sun. It also appears that I am incredibly wound up. I just got out of a long relationship, so I'm not looking for anything serious right now. Ideally, I'll meet someone incredible and become really close friends. 

The kind of friend I'm looking for is open to anything. NOT just a friend with benefits, but instead someone who is willing to be really close. To cuddle on the couch, grab beers, or even just catch a movie with. A friend who is equally comfortable in a group, as just friends, or at home, incredibly close (when we need that). I'm looking for someone who wants to find us at Greenlake, hang out, and see how impulsive we are. 

Are you wound up too? Are you willing to make a new friend immediately? Can you cross boundaries and still go back (if needed)?

This could go down in two different ways:

A) The extra-fun/adventurous way - Let me know you're interested. Respond with a short message explaining who you are. I'll respond with limited information and you can find us.

B) The slightly safer/adventurous way - You respond with a picture, I will do the same. That way we both feel slightly better about physical attractiveness and not getting murdered in the park.

*note: I will not send a picture unless I get one, but have no problem doing so after-the-fact

About me: Professional, educated, fun, attractive. Though I would probably mix up that order if asked to rank. 

You: Attractive, educated, fun, professional. Though (again), the order is subject to change.

Come out. Find us. Play in the park.

Life is hard enough just living it. With so many responsibilities you sometime sit and 
wonder ""what the fuck"" -- how did I get here? The twenties flew by and then ""dum da da 
da"" -- you're married. Then shortly after that is that baby crying and the whole 9 yards. 
Luckily I have older children but I still find myself daydreaming about the days I spent 
wasted on the couch listening to Pink Floyd's ""Comfortably Numb"" -- all those night with 
nowhere to go and nothing to do. 

Now, don't get me wrong, I have a great husband and I'm not complaining about his 
lack of love for me or anything related to that but there are things we just don't' share. 
Like my writing for example. Though I haven't written much lately, I have books of 
poetry and stories that he seems uninterested in. That's a HUGE pare of who I am. 
Well we all have a face that we hide away forever and we take them out and show 
ourselves when everyone has gone. We share so many secrets there are some we 
never tell. Tell them to me. 

As you know life at times it can be robotic, redundant, and now (for me) with dealing 
with a sick child (my son) is overwhelming and makes it even harder. I want to find 
someone who has a good heart -- a good soul. We can get to know each other and 
because we are in the same situation (with marriage and children) -- we might ""get"" 
each other in ways others don't. I've bared my soul to a stranger I met on the internet, 
not once, not even twice. I'm too open and too trusting. I'm sure that the only one who 
can close this ""hole"" inside of me is me, but having a special friend in my life wouldn't' 
hurt. 

Albert Einstein said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over 
again and expecting different results. So does that mean I'm insane? For wanting to 
find someone out there who perhaps might share something similar. I call it 
perseverance which means ""continued effort to do or achieve something despite 
difficulties and failure."" 

If any of this resonates with you -- if you are someone who won't just disappear without 
a reason at least. Let's talk and see where it can go.

My weekdays are extremely busy but my weekends are quite slow and boring. I'd like to find a companion who would like to get together Saturdays or Sundays for some physical activities. No, I don't mean that, I mean hitting the trails with our mountain bikes, walking/running around Capital Lake or exploring new parts of the Chehalis Trail. I'd love to lose about 30 pounds and my past experience has shown me that it's so much easier to do with a partner. 

My focus at this point in my life is on my children and my education, so I'm strictly looking for a platonic friendship. If you've been lazy about your exercise routine too then get in contact with me and we can motivate each other to get our butts in gear. Spring is right around the corner, so now's the time to get going on this.

This will be a long post so for anyone who doesn't like to read, I suggest you move on as I am very talkative online lol

About me:
20 years old
Vegan
Atheist
Furry
Have piercings
5'8
Weight 267
Love rodents and horses
Not a kid person. At all. 
Not a family person either. 
Introvert.
Minimalist
Non smoker 
Don't drink
420 friendly but I don't partake
Shy
Asexual
Supernatural fan
Love Japanese culture 
Like exploring
Disabled 
Avid guinea pig lover
Extremely sarcastic
Kevedd fan (Kevin x DD)

For those of you that are Kevedd fans, I will simply say that I have a personality that is a mix of Kevin and Double D. I'm extremely sarcastic and hate most people like Kevin, but I'm very clean and shy like DD, well that and very submissive like him. 

I'm transgender FTM pre op. 

Please do not contact me if you have or want a kid, I have tried getting along with people who have or want kids my age before and it just doesn't work. Also please don't contact me if you smoke cigarettes, it is a disgusting habit and you smell nasty. 

I like nature and guinea pigs. My favorite band is Blood on the Dance Floor, no I am not an extreme fan and I will not threaten to kill you or say you are a horrible person if you do not like them. 

I just recently started getting into Crown The Empire, I like Bart Baker and nature music. My music taste can be all over the place but I will not listen to religious Music, Folk Music or music where the singer is screaming to the point that I have to guess what they are saying so most screamo/metal lol

I can be very talkative, but in person I am not extremely talkative. I am autistic, so I do not like people touching me very much. Even a handshake makes me uncomfortable. Unless you are put on to my list of people I am comfortable with having physical contact with, I probably won't want much physical contact. It's part of being autistic.

When I'm not in school, I try to be in the gym or I am out running errands. I like to draw, color, swim, walk and lift weights with my lower body.

I am a minimalist, I have slight obsessive compulsive disorder and I am horrible at washing dishes. I like long naps and procrastinating on the weekend. I also love Supernatural.

I love rodents, some reptiles and horses. Guinea pigs are my favorite animal. I don't really like cats but I can kind of get along with them.

You can add me on Facebook @dahvie hammons (creamsicle). My profile picture is a headshot of a orange, cream and black colored Fox dragon. 

Please do not add me if you do not intend to speak with me. Or if you don't intend to talk very much, I don't want to add people who will just collect dust on my friend list.

Oh, please don't contact me if you are religious, why make fun of God all the time, and I generally feel uncomfortable around religious people. I support abortions and Bernie Sanders. 

It would be really great to find another vegan or at least vegetarian in the area. Not a requirement at all but it would be great to actually find someone I can relate with on a different level.

I did mention I was disabled, I am not wheelchair-bound, I have autism and Whiplash in my back and neck. I can definitely walk for about an hour before I get tired.

Please be under the age of 30.

This may seem strange (and this post may get Flagged) but I want to post it as part of my quest to father another child. 
I see posts on here from single ladies and gay couples seeking sperm donors. And yes, I have responded to them, hoping they might want to have a child using my sperm. No takers yet. 
Why? Well, for several reasons, I love children and while married, we had three great sons. We both hoped to have both a boy and a girl and planned to stop at two children. The first two were boys so we tried again with the understanding that this would be the last. Since my wife was having all deliveries by C-section, the doctor had to know at the time of deliver, if her tubes were to be tied. (in those days, they were unable or wouldn't determine the sex of the baby prior to delivery.) So, the directive was to tie her tubes at this, third C-section delivery. And again a healthy boy.

I have always been very pleased and proud of all three of my sons and they all finish college with advanced degrees, good job and great marriages. I always had the hope that they would provide me with a grand-daugther. Seven grandsons later,... and there isn't any plans for any more grand kids. 

I have since divorced and don't intent to remarry but still want to father a daughter. Of course, with the knowledge that the odds are still 50/50 that it could again be another boy. Not a problem since this child would still be loved and supported as were his/her siblings. 

I am retired now but still very healthy and comfortable in my life, but still have room in my heart, life and home for another child. In my optomistic life span projections, I can still provide for this child through college and it adulthood. Additionally, I offer my family genes/DNA, of high intellect and character.

So. There are my arguments. And here is the proposition. 

I am looking for a healthy, sober, drug free, caucasion lady, of child baring age. Single, partnered or married. I would like that this insemination be done either naturually or self induced insemination. I can't see any real reason to involve clinic or labs. (if at first we don't succeed, try, try again) Maybe, I'm over simplifing this, but why complicate that which is so natural! (aside from the use of a Surrogate, and even that is becoming a norm.)

If you (or even you & partner) are interested in this. Please contact me. There maybe other alternative parenting arrangements available in my or our quest to parent a child.

I am going to Emerald City Comic Con 8-10, and normally I go to conventions alone. However, I typically go to anime conventions, and I really don't know if there will be many people in my fandom. I have a feeling that I might be kinda lost in this con because it seemed to be geared towards Marvel/DC type comics. Anyways, I am hoping to chill with someone around my age if possible. Needless to say, just looking for someone who is chill. Also, I do cosplay and likely will be at this convention.

So, there's this girl. She's a manager at a coffee shop I go to pretty much everyday. Lately, I've had a crazy crush on her. She's beautiful, smart, funny, but more important, nice to me. The more I get to know her, the more I see how much we have in common. 

Sometimes I feel that I'm not into her, that I just enjoy the interaction because she's the only other female that I talk to other than my co workers and friends. This morning though, when she said hi to me, I started to smile like a fool. I really do like this girl. 

Thing is, I've lost my mojo and have become extremely shy and afraid to make a move. I'm afraid of the rejection. I used to not be like this, used to be confident and bold. 

I feel that I'm just overthinking it and should just go for it. But what if she doesn't feel the same, what if she's taken? What if she's just being nice to me because that's her job. I don't know what to do. I always try to talk to her as much as I can without keeping her from doing her job. 

So internet, what should I do? Should I make a move or just let it be?

I am a married guy looking to make some friends that are either in shape or getting there and wouldn't mind taking on a partner. I have found it tough to motivate myself recently with the stress of work, a new baby, and everyday life. Here's where the ""specialized"" part comes in:

I remembered back when I was trying to impress a specific woman. Someone that was in much better shape than I was and someone I figured was ""out of my league"" at them time. I remember the motivation I had at that time to really work hard and force myself into being more self aware and self controlled. I want to get that back... I'm not asking for any kind of sexual relationship or sharing of wives, but I would like to find a couple or single woman that would allow me to think and feel like I'm working to impress her. I know ultimately I will be doing this for myself, and for my family, but this type of motivation can be Very powerful as I've found in the past! I would like to be able to flirt just enough to keep me interested but never cross any boundaries you and I set. I am open to rewards as well if that's something that sounds like you would do but if not then strictly business and friendship.

I'm currently 235 and would like to get back down to around 195 or 200.

Is there anyone out there that will help me ditch this Dad bod?

She doesnt like to text and told me to find some one else to text so...... here I am. Good ol Craigslist. lol but Im Not sure any body even looks here any more for a social environment but hey, I'll give it a shot anyways. :-) I am new to the Olympia area and have been here for about a year and am looking to start expanding my social circle and meet new people out side of the gym and work who are local and are also looking to make new friends. Dont really have too many friends right now around Olympia and with my work schedule and my kid its hard to find the time to go out and socialize and meet new people. :-/

So what am I looking for?? Hhmmm..... just any body who wants to talk who is local. Kinda looking for a side kick. Some one to hang out with and do things with. Hanging out with the guys is fun but some times you just wanna change it up. Looks dont matter. I think the out side is just a disguise anyways. Its not what you look like, its who you are so Dont let the fact that I work out detour you because I am not shallow. I'll be friends with any one as long as you can hold a conversation with more than one letter. :-/

So yeah... if you wanna chat and see if we click hit me up! I have nothing but time. We can talk about any thing. :-)
If this ad is still up Im still lookin! means I havent found any body I connect with yet. Im just looking for one person who is local and may have similar interests and looking for a bff.

Hi Im Chrissy,
Im looking to meet friends and go on dates with individuals that are lgbt friendly.
Im clean and disease free and a great citizen.

Believe it or not even tho im beautiful, I dont have many friends.
I like Dancing, and playing guitar. I would love go grocery shopping with you and load your groceries for you. Maybe we could have Iced tea and sit and chat.
I would like to go to concerts or bike riding. i like martial arts and am a great artist.
we could go to karaoke. I love coffee! lets grab a salad and eat at an outside cafe. 
We could go sit watch a movie or go for a drive and take some pics of Washington's beautiful countryside and mountain scenery.

Hey what's up?

So I know this sounds totally fucked up and gay, but I've always had a thing about being put in cuffs, bullied, talked down to. I don't know what it is, but it feels fuckin good. AM NOT LOOKING FOR SEX... JUST TWISTED BUDS. 

Just a regular dude, 26, about 200 lbs, brown hair, high and tight. I'll say this again, STRAIGHT - - no sex!! It's not sex that turns me on - - it's the power exchange. As in you taking control, and enjoying it! I probably got a bit of a boot/shoe fetish too since I do love licking them when ordered to. This could be an awesome DL thing if you've always thought about this but never tried it.

Im lookin for another bro to come hang out with me (or me go there), we drink a bit, hang out, and he starts talkin down to me, call in me names, wrestling... To the point he's got me cuffed or tied (I got some restraints) and I'm helpless to the point where I'm immobilized down at his boots... And once I'm down he just ignores me or talks down to me, makes fun of me etc... Good drunk bro fun :) if you've got some dirty boots you need cleaned, just jam 'em in my face and demand em spotless. I'll comply.

I KNOW there has to be other straight dudes who are into this... Again, nothin sexual, but it does just feel 'right' to me. If you've got some stress to vent this would be a good way to do it. BTW the pic above is an extreme example - - I'm cool with anything from rope to full out metal.

Hit me up with a pic, you'll get mine. Let's do this... Been lookin for a bud who can get I to this for a while. 18-35 yo only.

Hello Ladies!

I'm a nerd-inclined, open-minded, midwest-transplant girl hoping to make new girlfriends in the Seattle area.

I like comedy, netflix, anime, cartoons, art, music, video and board games. I also get really excited about anything to do with cute animals. 

I'm 420 friendly and it'd be nice if you are too for ice-breaking but that's not a requirement. Id like to find someone who might be interested in taking a yoga class, because Im super into yoga now, and I'd love to find people to play Magic the Gathering with as well.

I like being upfront and honest with people, but I also love sarcasm and not taking things too seriously.

If any of this sounds appealing to you please respond with something interesting about yourself so we can start a dialogue. I am only interested in platonic friendships so please no creepers :)

I am into music, movies, art, the outdoors, trying local restaurants, coffee shops, or cafĂŠs, etc. I am an excellent conversationalist and a fiercely loyal friend. 

I am not looking to change anyone's situation and am definitely not looking for sex. I'm looking for a dad around my age for friendship only. Local would be great, as I don't have a car. No religious types or addicts, please.

Hello,

About twice a month I have to stay in Oak Harbor overnight for work. I would love to find a friend in the area. 

I really like the guys I work with when up there, and have actually gone out and done things with them, but honestly I get along better with women. It would be great to find someone to go to dinner with, maybe a movie and as the weather gets nice, a hike in the afternoon. 

Someone to show me around and what there is to do on the island. I will say that I'm usually there on week nights, but sometimes that's on a Friday as well. As summer comes on, I'm thinking more and more about extending my stays through the weekends. A bit of a vacation as it were. Or use that as a jumping off point for a trip or two to Canada.

I'm single. I know this is the Platonic section, but I should throw out that there is no drama! I'm fit and take care of myself, so getting out and being active is what I'm looking for. Hiking sightseeing and over a weekend, some backpacking and camping?

If at all interested, let me know.

I am a caring and nurturing person who's first goal in life has become to enrich the lives of those who I love, which begins with family, myself, and extends to the entire planet. I am also an escapist and a musician, and I like to spend a lot of time away from society where I find it more fulfilling and healing. I do not do well with most institutions in society. I prefer to adventure and seek out alternative lifestyles. I also need to exercise and go on adventures becasue I have hibernated all winter.

I'm sure there are people out there who enjoy solitude, but I am not one of them. I recently relocated to the area for a great job in Olympia from the east coast and I do not know anyone out here. More than anything, I would like to find someone I can share time with for the occasional meal and potentially do things with on the weekends too. I don't really care what we do; just that it is something fun that two people can do together. 

A little about me: I was born in the 1960's and have kept fit by playing rugby for more years than my friends think is sane, but it is most likely why people tell me I don't look my age; I have a graduate degree, so I can carry a decent conversation; I love to laugh and to not be serious all the time; I am generally energetic and prefer to get out and do things.

I know this is brief, but I will be happy to share more over a cup of something delicious so you get the pleasure of seeing me while hearing me. Please send along a picture and I will respond with one as well.

So, just trying this out...I'm a mid-40's guy, getting through a series of life re-boots. I'm single (divorced), coming off of a series of medical issues, and figure to be an ""empty nester"" within the next year or two...so I'm trying to remember what living for ""me"" is about.

I've been a musician (guitarist) forever, play out in occasional jams, recording with some fellow musicians when time allows. I'm also currently finishing up my BA and debating going after my Master's. I didn't even start college until 40, when the medical stuff forced me to have down time. Let's see, I'm a rock music geek, I love Sci-Fi and various different genres, various sports teams, auto racing (several different forms), reading, and I really love great conversation.

I'm looking for someone, texting/email is fine, at least initially...to chat with, and see where things go. I was married for a long time, and only moved to the area a few years ago, so I'm looking to really rejoin the world. I believe that would be much more enjoyable with some companionship involved.

I'm a really big/tall guy (though the ""big"" is dwindling after a recent surgery), and have a quick wit and a slightly warped sense of humor.

Yes it rains out here but we'll dry off:) I want to find someone that knows I can't give them 100% of my attention due to having a job and responsibility but wants to enjoy time together when it's possible and DO THINGS and get to know each other.... someone not wanting to rush things and not clingy and anyways I guess we'll see what happens

I honestly have no clue where to start... but I guess I will say I have never had that one friend I could call a best friend... and as I get older I find myself loosing touch with the many acquaintances and wishing I had that one best friend did more and more...

I am 25, married, stay at home mom of three kids (oldest is 3 years). My main hobby is gaming currently (mostly xbox atm) but I am hoping to find new hobbies =) Of course not a requirement but kids in the same age group would be wonderful... My husband is wonderful but a tad anti social but maybe if you're married or in a relationship by amazing luck the guys are friend compatible as well? (too good to be true? lol) I am a bit unhappy with my weight and just recently purchased a treadmill and a elliptical/bike combo so maybe if you are looking for a work out buddy? Hubby works a late swing 5pm-1:30am M-F so I often find myself lonely in the evenings... Maybe we could go out at times but also I am often stuck at home with the kids (and it is more realistic with 3 little ones)... Looking for that friend I am excited to have come hang out... have dinner... just chill around the house...

When I'm just getting to know someone I am kind of shy... which can sometimes lead to rambling lol.... But really I am generally an unfiltered, honest, caring person =) Not sure what else to include... no way to get to know a person via a craigslist ad lol...

What is so hard to understand about simply wanting a new friend. I'll be the first to admit that I have been stuck in a rut for a long time, but I am looking to change that. I am 46 and been divorced for six years and the father of a teenage girl. I have full custody of her and wouldn't change a thing about it. Between her and my job I stay very busy. I am putting this out there not because I am looking for a relationship after all this is the strictly platonic section. I am just looking to find a new friend. At first I have a tendency to be a little shy and quiet, but I am open up as I get to know that person. If looks are important then maybe this is the wrong section to be looking in. That being said I may not be the perfectly good looking man most people seem to dream about, but I don't think I would send you away screaming. Lol. Who I am looking for her is someone who would like to chat through email or text or talk on the phone as we get to know each other. Then maybe dinner occasionally, movies, casino. Also, I would be interested in maybe going to the gym. It is one of my goals to get in better shape I just find it hard to find the motivation to go on my own. If I sound like someone you would like to get to know I look forward to hearing from you.

Sometimes I wonder if you think about me. I wonder if you miss being in the back of my bike, and if you ever look to see if it's me when you hear the roar of one drive by. 
Do you ever miss just seeing my face? Do you ever miss our talks and wish we could we could catch up sometime? 
Those deep conversations, the fun times, and the food and drinks we shared, I do nothing now days. 
Look me up, I don't live where I did, but you can find me on Facebook. Drop me a line, and let's chat. 
No, I'm not a troll. I know I'm vague. But if you wish it were me writing to you, then take a chance and see if I'm still me.

I don't like to spend much time online. I like to stay busy.. Maybe I just don't want to put in the effort... But tonight I've had a few, so here I am. I'm a country boy. Born and raised in a small town, and yes, you gotta be a hard, blue collar worker to be called country. Having horses most definitely helps when u wanna be considered a country boy/girl. Unlike stereotypes, I'm well versed and well educated. I wish to find a unique woman, talented in music (at least keep a beat) and doesn't rely on conversation throughout the day to achieve a joyfull life.. Someone whom I can talk to without the fear of saying the wrong thing, a friend (@ 1st). I want the ""shy girl"" that also looks at social media as a waste of time (in most cases).

Ok, so here's the story; I moved up here in late January. I'm living with my brother, his wife, and my nephew. I came here leave all my bad influences and past problems behind. I want to start new. I'm currently not working but I'm looking forward to working. For the meantime, I'm taking care of my nephew to save my brother and sister in law money on daycare. I'm a child at heart. I have 17 tattoos. I'm kinda nerdy. I watch a lot of variety of shows/movies from comedies to horror and even drama (greys anatomy is dope!) I'm not gay, I feel the need to say that because I apparently give off a vibe?? Lol ummm I'm pretty awesome. I'm Hispanic. Idk what else. Mainly looking for a friend since I'm alone up here lol

Hi,
I'm looking for new friends in the area. I'm a pretty laid back guy, always enjoy a bit of 420 or going out for a few drinks and watching some sports. I'm kind of happy we're getting good weather and would love to outside and check out the sites. I'm a bit of a news junkie at times, go bernie! 

I'm looking for someone under the age of 35, close to Olympia and I'd prefer if you were single, I don't want to be the third wheel lol.

Good morning, afternoon, evening (whichever applies to you). I've posted several times on here with no luck. I'm looking to just have a chat partner, someone to help me pass the time through the day. I travel for work (something to chat about?) with my work which is quite unique. I'm not looking to meet up or anything like that. Just want to have a digital relationship with someone. 

I'm looking for a woman because all men want to talk about it sports it seems. I like them, don't get me wrong, but would prefer to engage in more meaningful conversation. That's why I'm looking for a lady; they are the real conversationalists. 

I'm educated, enjoy a variety of things, and will at least provide my opinions. I like to take photos of my work surroundings and will sometimes include one of myself. Pics are not required though. Just want someone who can make the last hour of the work day go by that much faster or make me giggle on my lunch break. 

Ive got KiK (MrBaker1582) or can do email (or another messenger service I don't know about? Hope to hear back from someone!

Hey there all...

Not really sure where to begin! I have always been intrigued by the drag scene. Ever since I saw a small drag show at a redlight variety show I've really wanted to dress up in drag at least once!! I haven't told any of my friends this because I'm not sure how they would take it lol. I've tried makeup and stuff myself, but a shake a little too much haha. I would just like a friend who could help me check this off my bucket list if you will. I'm 29, definitely not a creeper! Attractive guy, not sure about being an attractive fem haha. Anyways I digress, I think it would be fun to dress up and go to a drag show. Far too shy to perform. Just a thought...

I am a guy that doesn't want children, nor can I even have any. Unfortunately, I am also completely obsessed with the pregnant form. Yes, I will admit that a lot of the fascination is sexual in nature, but not entirely. I feel about nothing else the way I do when a pregnant women walks by. My world stops and my focus shifts. It's actually a little disorienting, but kind of exhilarating at the same time.

Basically, I would just like to befriend someone who is pregnant. It would be very interesting and fun to have a pregnant email / txt pal for general conversation, etc. I will in no way expect anything more than friendship.... and understanding of an odd but otherwise harmless kink *chuckle*

At any rate, if you want to know more just shoot me a response. Even if that more is just being curious why I would go to such lengths for so little!

Howdy folks. I am in the market for a shiny new texting buddy, with the added option of escalating into activity partners. What the hell does that mean? Well, lemme tell you. It occurred to me the other day that I don't really have any friends up in the area outside of work. Well, I opt to change that. I'm just looking for someone to get to know and text throughout the day. You know, have that persom who you could feel comfortable talking about anything to, without fear of being judged. Someone to help pass time with, joke with, or bounce ideas off of. Whatever's clever.

Should both paties mutually agree that things click well, I am open to the idea of moving to activities together, as well. Movies, hiking, music shows, grabbing dinner, just hanging out, art projects, camping, it's all good to me. My goal here is to develop some new, local, and hopefully strong friendships. 

Who would probably jive with me best? Those that don't take themselves seriously and can laugh at just about anything, those that have a sense of humor, those who are genuinely curious and enjoy learning new things, those that enjoy new experiences, and those that know the difference between an argument and stimulating verbal discourse that involves the exchange of ideas that differ from yours and you can walk away with an appreciation of something new and different. If you have an appreciation for art and nature, are reasonably fit and enjoy running, hiking and other outdoor activities, and appreciate good writing, art, music, then dont be shy. If you're an artist yourself, or you enjoy going to metal shows, then what the hell are you waiting for? If most of that applies to you, then dont hesitate to say hi! 

That's enough babbling for now. If you read this far, I'll do you a solid in good faith. Simply reply back with something in the subject line that you'd like me to draw for you (think what you'd ask to be drawn on a pizza box lid) along with your texterer number in the email body. I will, in return, furiously scribble you a crude drawing with about 5 minutes worth of effort based on your request, and text you a pic of it. Don't expect Picasso. And I'll probably only do it for the first few responses. SO DON'T DAUDLE! Thanks for reading :)

Note- someone replied to me and I didn't see til three days later, I tried to respond,but since my ad expired I don't know if you got my reply or not? Please let me know if that's you, there was only one person who responded to this

I've always struggled with feeling lonely. I have friends,but most of them are the kind of introverted people who enjoy lots of space and alone time. I'm an extremely extroverted person who gets clingy and wants daily communication if possible. It's easy to find people to talk to,but honestly these people rarely ever stay. They seem to just vanish,then I have to go find a new batch of chatting buddies,and I'm sick of this ugly cycle. I wish there could be a constant stable group of people I had daily communication with,who didn't change and leave after a few months.

I definitely want more female friends, women understand emotions, and they are better at being emotionally supportive.
I'm 27, single, no kids, struggling to get my life together. Could definitely use someone to talk to. I would prefer someone close to my age so we are in the same sort of life stage (though I'm aware more ladies my age have kids and a man and I cannot really relate to that,but I can't really relate to the 20-24 yr old crowd anymore either)
I struggle with depression,and would love a texting support buddy I could also meet up with occasionally for coffee and such.

Hi. So this is kinda like an all time low posting here to connect with someone lol. I thought I'd just try anyway to see what the responses would be like. I don't really use craigslist for dating but figure what the hell. I don't get out much and so I guess it would be nice to kinda meet someone "" electronically"" lol. I am a down to earth, chill and funny kind of person. I don't take life too serious but I do have things going for myself. I own my own home, work hard and have a decent car :). I love movies, books, music, any kind of sports except for baseball. Don't ask why just watch and you'll see for yourself. Anyway, I may just leave it at that. I don't know what to really expect but I am guessing a few replies. My only thing is please don't be a smoker or a heavy drinker. Huge turn off for me and if you are then no disrespect but we won't even come close to being close friends. I just don't like that image and I feel that everyone should be smart by now not to smoke. Have a good day and maybe we'll chat?

I'm a single guy, 32 years old, hoping to find a female friend to occasionally hang out with for gaming and/or watching shows together. Platonic. Specifically RPG gamers... not really into first person shooters or sports games. Currently playing WoW, Dark Souls II, Diablo 3 (PS4) and always up for trying new RPG's, also like board games and working on producing my own. 

Shows? Walking Dead, Penny Dreadful, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Supernatural, Hemlock Grove, Being Human (U.K.) ... mostly fantasy stuff, or shows that are really well-written and have stellar ratings, such as Breaking Bad. 

I'm introverted (INFP) and probably asexual. Especially interested to meet and befriend other iNtuitives ; ) I'm stable and most of the time just enjoy being alone, but also been thinking it would be sweet to have a platonic gaming friend. I don't care what your race, creed or orientation is, as long as you have the soul of a female!

Looking for a person to talk to about pretty much everything. It could be about anything really. A bit about me...I am 45, love dogs and singing. Consider myself a renaissance man (lots of learned skills). Can be flirtatious and funny. I work alone most of the time so it gets a bit tedious with so much time on my hands. 

Thanks for considering

First, I would like to send my Congratulations to all you lucky ladies out there. Though, only ONE of you will have the chamce of sweeping me off my feet and carrying me off into the sunset..
But ALL of you, will have the privilege , no, the Honor! Of emailing me. 
I know you're probably thinking to yourself, this guy is ""full of it""! But rest assured, I am not! 
I would bet my life that if I were the last man on the face the earth, I would totally get A girl.... You can take that to the bank!!
I'm sure there are a few of you who are still unsure. So here's another example. 
One night, I was at a red light and It was taking too long so I pulled out my phone. And out of nowhere! I heard a horn honking, so I looked through the rear view mirror and I saw it was a lovely young lady who was honking. Obviously, she was trying to get my attention. Or as the urban youths would say, 
""Trynna holla at me"" 
BUT! The light was green so I couldn't grace her with my presence. 
That darn light!!

Anyways, a little about myself..
I am 28 years old.
I stand 6'0 (without heels)
My doctor would disagree, but I consider myself ""in shape ""
I mean, last I checked.. An Oval is a shape.

Alright, I'm gonna get straight to the point. I'm looking for a best friend to say the least. I have friends but no one has become more than that. I'm mainly looking for someone who I can talk to about makeup and hair and go out with and mainly hang out with whenever we want, females only. I want someone who loves to hear about the drama but doesn't want to be involved. I like watching hours of Hulu or Netflix, I love blogged (Tumblr all the way!), I love going to the movies, I'm a committed raver and on the right nights a clubber too! I'm straight forward and blunt so I need someone who can understand that and I'm also a bit of an asshole but don't misinterpret that, I love having fun and I can always be there. You have to be LGBTQ+ friendly, I am a lesbian and no I'm not looking for a girlfriend. I am 420 friendly but I don't usually smoke. I love live music, going to parks or beaches, I'm a girly girl at heart and am down to do anything of that nature. FaceTime me on the toilet, that's how much I don't give a shit. No pun intended! If you are reading this and at all interested or it sounds like you rigged or not shoot me an email! Your photo gets you mine and I don't mind exchanging number! Good luck!

Hi everyone! 

I've posted a while back when I first moved here, but no one really clicked with me so I'm trying again. I'm from Orange County, CA and just moved here last month because my husband's best friend lives here and we wanted to move somewhere new. I'm starting to notice that WA people don't care for CA people moving here unless it's for Army related reasons lol. I do adore CA with a passion, but I swear I'm not here to steal jobs or talk hours on end about how amazing CA is compared to here. :p

Back on topic, I'm looking for a few friends to become close with. As stated, I'm a pretty big introvert so big parties and whatnot aren't really my thing. I'm hoping to find someone chill who can have fun just binge watching Friends and eating an insane amount of cookies. I do have two kids (Ages 1 & 11) so I do enjoy getting out of the house once in a while for a movie, browsing book stores, and drinking over-priced coffee. My personality type is pretty sarcastic and blunt which can be a pro/con depending on how your personality type is. I'm into rock/alternative music, anime, hero movies/shows, Tim Burton, and enjoy red velvet cake more than the average person. 

Any feels of connection, feel free to message me! If I don't respond right away, it's because I had replying on my phone but I'll get to it asap haha.

Hi and thank you for reading.

Looking for a trauma-informed and conscious, considerate friend. Eastside location. The last time I put a lengthy note here, it ended up on some Interent forum, where a bunch of folks were basically tearing me apart. With that said, perhaps it is best if you send a short bio to me, and I respond.

Anyhow, it is preferable it you are familiar with trauma, yet have not experienced a trauma yourself, as I am seeking a strong person to help to build me up. I don't have any support and the one friend I have is having a hardship, such is life. 

Moi: Age range - 28-37; mature, considerate, quiet, not a big phone talker, more of a listener, active learner, interested in metaphysics, yoga, healthful living (raw), hiking, and homesteading, non-toxic living etc. You don't have to be a perfect match, just please be someone who knows how to listen. For example if I discuss the trauma, I really don't care if someone you know has the same trauma. Most people I talk to keep blah blah my cousin, in-law has XXXX. Anyone who is sane will surely understand this frustration and desire to connect on a much less superficial level. There is this saying that goes, ""When people talk about others to you, they will surely talk about you to others."" So yes, I'm private, substance-free, and when not experiencing a trauma, concerned with living my own life in a quiet manner that reflects my own interests.

Also, while I live in America (won't state if citizen or non) I tend to get along with those who are not American born and have a much deeper perspective on life.
Thank you for reading and I hope to hear back~

The other categories I've posted in have brought an overwhelming response but not of the serious nature that I had hoped for. I am seriously missing the intimacy and romance that tends to disappear from long term relationships. I'm looking to find a similarly situated man to converse with. Maybe we will meet, maybe not. The attraction for me has little to do with still life ie. your photo but with a connection based on similarities in our lives. You are between the age of 50 an 65 and gainfully employed or perhaps retired. It isn't all about sex but about finding or creating a special friendship. Anyone out there with the same needs?

I'm here in search of a woman to develop a friendship with and spend time with doing all the usual things us girls do - drinks, mani-pedi, shopping (wouldn't it be fun to go try in lingerie or go to Lover's?) etc but also someone who is open minded about adult topics and wouldn't mind having candid conversations about it - I have a side of me that I can't reveal to my current friends - the side that likes being with women occasionally. Maybe you have these thoughts too and no one to share them with? Maybe we can explore and experiment too?

I'm not looking for anything other than to win the big karate tournament, but if an unhealthy co-dependent relationship develops then we will see where it goes.
Please include at least three references and your win/loss record in karate tournaments.

I know you're probably thinking to yourself, this guy is ""full of it""! But rest assured, I am not! 
I would bet my life that if I were the last man on the face the earth, I would totally get A girl.... You can take that to the bank!!
I'm sure there are a few of you who are still unsure. So here's another example. 
One night, I was at a red light and It was taking too long so I pulled out my phone. And out of nowhere! I heard a horn honking, so I looked through the rear view mirror and I saw it was a lovely young lady who was honking. Obviously, she was trying to get my attention. Or as the urban youths would say, 
""Trynna holla at me"" 
BUT! The light was green so I couldn't grace her with my presence. 
That darn light!!

I've never done this before, so here goes:

I'm 35. I'm 6'3"" tall, roughly 250 lbs. trying to lose weight, and have already lost 20 lbs since I've started. I'm looking for someone to talk to and get to know. I'm not here for sex, even though it sounds great. I've been neglected and broken in the past, and I'm starting a new chapter. I miss adult conversation and physical touch. I'm not desperate to date, I have my mind made up as to what I want, and won't settle for anything less. I'm smart, sometimes sarcastic, a lover, a fighter, and will do anything it takes for the right person. My downfall is that I try to please people to much, and I always end up with the short end of the stick. I'm a good listener, and can offer advice, or just be a shoulder to cry on. I have a good job, and I'm tattooed. If I sound like someone you'd like to get to know, email me and we can talk, or you can get my number and text. Send a pic in your reply, and I'll send one back. But in the pic, I want to see your face, not your assets. I hope to hear from you soon.

Hey hey - 

Hope all is well for you guys out there! I'm a 27 year old gay gamer looking for other fellow gamers. I mainly play Action/RPG/Fighter/FPS video games on consoles like PS4 or 3DS/WiiU. However, I have had quite an interest in board games recently. I've only played a handful of board games but would not be opposed to meeting others who are interested video/board games.

I've lived here for over a year and would like to expand my circle of friends. I'm a 5'8"" latino with a stocky build. I'd say. I can be very introverted at first but once I feel pretty comfortable, my true colors show. I absolutely love to laugh and make other laugh all the time :D 
I regularly 420 with edibles or flower/dabs, so if you're cool with that -- awesome!

I'm hoping to find friends who like to play multiplayer games like Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Cal Of Duty, ect. I'd like a reason to get out of the house and chill/play video games.

Although this ad may be target toward other gaming buddies, I do not want to restrict it to just gaming. I also enjoy checking out Seattle, eating at new places, cooking for others, networking, building, shopping, walking around and just having all around fun.

I am also looking to find a friend I can be sexually open with. I don't have many friends that I openly talk to about sex. I would very much enjoy having a mate who would like to occasionally jerk off and cuddle. 

If this sounds like something you're looking for, drop me a line.

I'm looking for someone to explore more of the city with.

I've been riding in Seattle for about two and a half years. I know North Seattle best, but have more than a passing knowledge of downtown and Capitol Hill after a brief stint as a courier. I love taking new routes and different turns on long rides.

Anyways, as the weather improves (and the climate brings in the heat, sadly), I'd like to find someone to ride with regularly.

I think we'd work well as riding partners if:

--You like riding.

Getting out on the bike is the most important part. Whether it's into a head wind on a cold day or along fields of flowers with blue sky, I want to be out there. Each ride is its own experience and I like to enjoy it.

--You're a little competitive. 

I'm happy to cruise around a lake at easy paces, lazing in the sun, but I also want to take that turn up a random hill to see what's at the top. And maybe to see who gets there first.

--You don't mind silence.

I'm pretty talkative, but on occasion it's nice to listen to the wind and look at the scenery.

--You appreciate nature

Literally stopping to smell the roses is part of the ride. I like taking a moment to stop and admire a view or listen to what's around me.

I'm hoping to find someone who can do a 40 mile ride with relative ease, if a bit of effort. My usual shorter rides are around 15-25.

If you feel like you don't know Seattle well or if you're new to the area, don't worry--I'm happy to show you around some. I hope to eventually stretch out towards Everett and Redmond.

Hopefully you're around 20-24, but if you're older and think we'd work well, that's cool too.

Like coffee during a ride? So do I. It's a good place to meet, too. Send me an email and we can find a shop.

Lastly, if you're racist, homophobic, or sexist, I'm not interested. We don't need to be best friends to ride well together, but that's no fun for anyone.

I must be out of my mind to think I'll meet a smart, attractive and truly funny woman on CL looking to befriend an attached dude for a platonic exploit. But what the hell. I'll either prove myself right after receiving replies from nothing but guys masquerading as women and hooker bots...or perhaps someone will prove me wrong. If you're here reading this, you'll know who you are. 

I'm late 40s, live and work in Seattle as a so-called ""professional"", am well educated, fit and married. Too much is missing in my day to day life to be truly satisfied and I'm hoping to make contact with someone in a similar situation who is looking for an outlet to share some giggles...or even tears. 

Why does attraction matter in strictly platonic? Because it just does, as much as I know that makes little rational sense!

Title practically says it all. Just need new people in my life. I work too much and the little free time I get, try to spend that time with the friends I do have, but they tend to snub me or decide to never get back to me. So new friends are more needed then playing the waiting game.

So, what I'm looking for? Someone roughly around my age, would prefer the female persuasion, as I don't have that many female friends since I've moved out here. I don't get to go out much as I'm either working or sleeping, and the time I do have off, been setting aside for people that tend to never show up or cancel at the last moment, as said before.

Taking Ballroom Dance classes in Silverdale and instructor has said I'm talented enough to learn international and compete someday. But in order to get enough practice in I need a male interested in Dance classes. There are always more women in the class than men. Need someone who has great natural rhythm.

Class in Silverdale is Friday night at 6:30 sharp. I need someone who will be there every Friday. I will pay for your first guest pass if interested so you can test before you decide to become a member.

This is in NO WAY a romantic relationship at all so sexual orientation does not matter... Just need a male who is good enough at acting that if he decided he also wished to go international the dancing partnership looks natural and not forced.

Need someone between the height of 5'10 to 6'4 (I'm 5'8 and will need to wear heels if we do decide to go into competition)

Someone only interested in the once a week lessons is also fine, you don't have to want to go as far in the dancing as I do. I just need the once a week partner to start.

This would be an awesome opportunity for an aspiring actor or aspiring model to add a talent.

Howdy folks. I am in the market for a shiny new texting buddy with the added option of escalating into activity partners. What the hell does that mean? Well, lemme tell you. It occurred to me the other day that I don't really have any friends in the area outside of work. Well, I opt to change that. I'm just looking for someone to get to know and text throughout the day. You know, have that person whom you could feel comfortable talking about anything to, without judgement or any of that noise. Someone to help pass time with, joke with, or bounce ideas off of. Whatever's clever.

Should both paties mutually agree that things click well, I am open to the idea of moving to activities together, as well. Movies, hiking, music shows, grabbing dinner, just hanging out, art projects, camping, it's all good to me. My goal here is to develop some new, local, and hopefully strong friendships. 

Who would probably jive with me best? Those that don't take themselves seriously and can laugh at just about anything. Those that have a sense of humor. Those who are genuinely curious and enjoy learning new things. Those that enjoy adventure and new experiences. Those that know the difference between an argument and stimulating verbal discourse that involves the exchange of ideas that differ from yours and you can walk away from with an appreciation of something new and different. If you have an appreciation for art and nature, are reasonably fit and enjoy running, hiking, and other outdoor activities, then dont be shy! If you're an artist yourself, salty and humorous language, or you enjoy going to metal shows, then what the hell are you waiting for? If most of that applies to you, then stop dilly-dallying!

That's enough yammering for now. If you read this far, I'll do you a solid in good faith. Simply reply back with something in the subject line that you'd like me to draw for you (think along the lines of what you'd ask to be drawn on a pizza box lid) along with your texterer number in the email body. I will, in return, furiously scribble you a crude drawing with about 5 minutes worth of effort based on your request, and text you a pic of it. Don't expect Picasso. And I'll probably only do it for the first few responses. SO DON'T DAUDLE! Thanks for reading :)

Now the category is tricky. No I am not looking for sex or a relationship so why am I seeking out a female? Well I'm open to something more and I love the company of a pretty girl.
I love fit and trim fun loving girls...Any color or race. That's not important. 
Just love to laugh and be open to all kinds of music. 
also be between 18-30. :) 
Let's just meet for a beer or coffee sometime and see if we like each other.

Hi, I have been an athlete for many years and because of the sport that I had practiced I have back spasms a lot. This is STRICTLY platonic. I don't care if it's male or female. A massage is a massage either way. I can cook something as a thanks or if you want we can go and enjoy some light hiking once in a while or simply hang out in town and have a cup of coffee or some wine.

I just don't get it, is craigslist the place for big women to hang out or what.
Now wen ever I do meet a nice looking woman on here, and I send my pic back,
I never hear from them anymore, so I must be ugly too.
It's just funny how ugly doesn't like ugly'',
I look for women that are more on the pleasant looking side,
I also in joy talking to younger women too, but there must be something about my age.
I don't think I'm old be any means, but the younger women don't want anything to do with me.
O'', by the way, I'm only looking for friends, low drama, pleasant looking, a little extra pounds is ok,
just don't be BBW'', I can click with big women, I just don't want to be friends with them.
I don't know why I feel that way, it's just how I feel, sorry to all the big people out there .
But at the same time I've been told I go after homely women, and just pleasant looking people,

I'd like to meet good people who live in Renton, south Seattle, Factoria, Newcastle, Kent and other areas within about a 15-mi. radius of Renton who are ~55 and up in age. Please be a reliable person who follows through after emailing, not so busy that you never can find time to socialize, and someone who plans to remain in the area. Thank you for reading the entire ad before replying to it with answers to the PLEASE NOTE paragraph below.

Are you looking for real, long-term, reliable friends rather than just acquaintances? I'm also ready to meet new friends closer to home who are kind and considerate to share good conversation and activities. How about you? Do you love nature and getting out into it? Art and music? Let's meet at a cafe for a conversation or get out for a park walk and chat on a good weather day and go from there.

People who are adventurous, will try new things and are curious about life in general are my favorite types of friends. My interests include almost anything that's outdoors in decent weather - good walks and hikes; having a good conversation; musical events; good movies, plants/gardening and public gardens; little road trips, and lifelong learning about all types of things including other cultures. Indoor pursuits like conversation over coffee, museums, dinner, talks, hearing music of many types and the like are great when the weather may not be cooperative. I'm hoping you share some of those interests and also want to meet someone who will share some of your unique interests and offers mutual support. I'm a non-smoker (you too, please) and occasionally have a wine or drink. We don't need any of this to have a good time, however. 

I'm a truly good person, have a sense of humor, and am a good friend who remembers birthdays, pays attention to what friends say, and tells them about news or activities I think will interest them. I'm also an empathetic person who will help friends in whatever way I can whenever I can. I'm intelligent, but not intellectual, have a spiritual side but am not religious. (No proselytizers, please) I'm reliable and look for other people who are too, as well as people who are kind, good people who have most of those qualities. Nobody is perfect, of course.

PLEASE NOTE: Please email and include where you are (city/neighborhood), a bit about your personality and interests, and days/time windows you're generally available to socialize. Please be close to the boomer age range and in the areas posted in the first paragraph above. If you'd like to send along your number in addition to a self-description to shortcut things, you can definitely trust me with it. 

If you're fit enough to get out for at least brisk walks, that would be great. I'm fairly fit for this age. I was born elsewhere, have been in the Northwest more than half a lifetime and have interest in meeting people from everywhere. If you're overly concerned with superficiality over substance, we very likely would not be compatible. Otherwise, I look forward to hearing from you soon! [Sorry, not looking to meet married people or couples. It doesn't generally work out that well.]

The good news is that it's a BEAUTIFUL Friday and the weekend is here. The bad news is that I'm feeling a bit feisty and have zero plans. Are you in the same boat? Wanna grab a pitcher of beer and play a game of pool (I'm terrible, by the way...)? Get jacked up on caffeine and watch ""Batman vs. Superman"" (I've heard it sucks, but as a lifelong Batman fan, I have to see it) or ""Deadpool"" (I've seen it and I wanna see it again)? Grab a bite and a pint somewhere yummy? See if there's any good bands playing at a local pub? Start our own cult? I'm single, not looking for anything more than finding someone awesome to paint the town red with, work in management, goofy, and a firm believer in the Oxford comma.

Come have lunch with me in downtown Bellevue, you pick the place, and I pick up the tab. No strings attached, we meet at the restaurant and go our separate ways after. Any woman is invited to accept this offer, no limits based on age, race, marital status, etc. This is just a crazy idea I had to meet new adventurous people. I am a 47 year old male, white, 5'10"", 160 lbs, and in very good shape. I am educated and have traveled and lived abroad. If you are interested, reply to this ad with your choice of restaurant in the subject line and a description of yourself in the message. Also, tell me why you would consider such an arrangement.

Sitting here bored watching tv, and a woman nails a guy in the crotch. He does the usually reaction, drops in the fetal position and moans like he's dying. 

I've never been hit like that before and wonder if its really that bad? Just like any other guy I've had the occasional tap, but seems like the other guys are playing it up. Of course its uncomfortable but it never hurt anywhere near how I see other guys react.

Since I don't have anything else better going on I figured I'd hit up craigslist and see if there is a woman bored as I am who'd want to find out as well. Maybe meet up for drinks first, lol. Could even make it interesting and place a bet on it.

Hi!

I moved to the area back in November and have yet to meet any good friends or even people I can text randomly to hang out. I have a couple work acquaintances but they're all married with kids and have no free time. 

I'm off weekends and just looking for someone to explore the area with. I'd love to be able to go on short road trips on the weekends or hangout and chat over coffee. Also up for simple things like going to target together or just baking cookies or something. :)

My interests:
Tv:Game of thrones, walking dead, the originals 
Music: country, top 40, 
movies: horror/scary movies

As for free time activities I love to explore/travel, cook, watch live entertainment, bake, go fora drive, go walking, kayaking, take advantage of groupon deals, and more!

I have no kids and am single. I take classes online and work Mon thru Friday. 

Anyways, if you're in the same situation as me please hit me up! I'd love to hangout if we click! 

Oh, this is strictly platonic please. 

Thanks,

So how about it ladies? Anyone interested in or know anyone who would like FREE (at first, I'll need practice) massages? Please let me know!

First, I would like to send my Congratulations to all you lucky ladies out there. Though, only ONE of you will have the chamce of sweeping me off my feet and carrying me off into the sunset..
But ALL of you, will have the privilege , no, the Honor! Of emailing me. 
I know you're probably thinking to yourself, this guy is ""full of it""! But rest assured, I am not! 
I would bet my life that if I were the last man on the face the earth, I would totally get A girl.... You can take that to the bank!!
I'm sure there are a few of you who are still unsure. So here's another example. 
One night, I was at a red light and It was taking too long so I pulled out my phone. And out of nowhere! I heard a horn honking, so I looked through the rear view mirror and I saw it was a lovely young lady who was honking. Obviously, she was trying to get my attention. Or as the urban youths would say, 
""Trynna holla at me"" 
BUT! The light was green so I couldn't grace her with my presence. 
That darn light!!

Anyways, a little about myself..
I am 28 years old.
I stand 6'0 (without heels)
My doctor would disagree, but I consider myself ""in shape ""

Quiet and observant when I'm in the world on my own, it's not easy to make human connection. Sex is not really something I'm into, but seems like most people who approach me are only interested in that and everything else I have to offer of my genuine self is taken as rejection. Honestly, that kind of hurts, I have a lot to offer. I like people who are humble, compassionate and crave learning new things. I'm politically active, love being outdoors in the summer and watching sci-fi movies on rainy days, especially on subjects of time travel or alternate dimensions. I do like psysical touch with someone I feel close to, cuddling or hand holding, lasting hugs. I have a positive outlook in life, but I have somewhat of a ""negative"" energy in that I absorb and listen deeply. I'm writing this right now because I am feeling loney and longing for a friend to share ice cream with and I still haven't seen fury road. If any of this resounds with you, I hope we'll meet and teach each other. Age and gender are not specifically important, I'm 30/female. I love singing pr dancing as the mood strikes and have a sense of wonder for the universe, accepting that there are mysteries I will never understand.

Now that we have nicer weather and more daylight, I'm looking for some people to join me in the great outdoors. Day hikes, snowshoeing, ski touring, mountaineering, backpacking, etc. I love to reach the quiet, pristine wilderness, which sometimes just requires a meandering walk along nice trails, and other times it takes 2-3 hours of driving followed by 15, 20, even 25 miles of steep hiking over rough terrain. I don't go anywhere dangerous or extreme though, partly because I'm usually carting a bunch of camera gear! 

So I'm looking for people who are in pretty good shape for those longer trips, but are also fine with the simpler outings. And you'll have to put up with me stopping occasionally to set up a tripod and take lots of pictures. But hey, I have a high-clearance SUV that I can drive, and I'll offer to plan everything, so you shouldn't complain ;) Or if you want to take the lead planning and/or driving, that's fine too! 

You should live near Seattle so we can easily meet for our trips, and we'd probably be able to relate better if you're somewhere around my age, say no more than 10-15 years apart. Other than that, just have a personality that's fun to be around :)

Hello there :) Lately I have been really needing a girlfriend. I have my boyfriend, who is great and all, but he doesn't fill this void I have. Sure there are some girls who I occasionally chill with, and they are amazing people, don't get me wrong, but I don't see them as often as I like. Maybe that's my problem. I dunno. I just really want a stable friend in my life. And that is something I am craving. I want someone who just clicks with me. Ya know? 
Some things about me:
I'm almost 28. Huge bookworm, video game nerd, anime nut, music lover, movie freak, in a committed relationship of almost 3 years, just very nerdy in general. I am also a Christian. Jesus is a huge part of my life, but I am accepting of all peoples. And I won't push my views on anyone. Though having bible studies or going to a church group would be awesome! 
I am not into parties or even large groups for the matter. I also don't drink, smoke, or do any drugs. Including pot. I don't mind if you do, I just can't be around it. 
Not sure what else to say. If you think we'll click or wanna know more, just shoot me an email.

So I'm a 45y.o. male currently legally separated and not getting back together with my partner, (sound like taylor swift) her choice is final and she would prefer I find someone else but keep her as a friend, due to kids ect. If you are at a dating site or meeting someone how would you perceive this, potential to go forward or pass it by or only look at divorce or single posts. I really don't want to divorce but have to go forward in life and love but would be willing to divorce for the right one. Thanks for any input or incites in this matter.

I roll my own cigarettes and use empty hard packs to pack and carry my smokes, my old packs are getting very worn!
I have acquired both the plastic and metal cigarette cases commonly sold in tobacco shops and online, but they aren't what I prefer or use. The reason is because with a cigarette hard pack I can just reach in for a smoke and lighter and light up in one easy motion, and there are enough people who want to bum my wonderful rollies as it is ;) . Those hard boxes they sell involve removing the pack from my purse and digging out a cigarette, complete with the scraping feeling that is not pleasant :( Also, those manufactured cigarette boxes don't load as easily as my reused hard packs. 
So there you have my reasons...
If you or anyone you know smokes non-menthol hard pack cigarettes and willing to pass the boxes along, please get in touch with me.
I am partial to Marlboro Lights, American Spirit or Camel packs, but I'm open as long as they're in good shape and not menthol!
I am willing to buy these if we can agree on a fair price.
I posted this under 'Wanted' and didn't get any response. In the spirit of posting in this platonic section I will add that if I met someone compatible who wanted to walk around the city smoking, as this weather gets nicer, I would think of that as a nice happenstance.

Howdy folks. I am in the market for a shiny new texting buddy with the added option of escalating into activity partners. What the hell does that mean? Well, lemme tell you. It occurred to me the other day that I don't really have any friends in the area outside of work. Well, I opt to change that. I'm just looking for someone to get to know and text throughout the day. I'm seeking the type of friend whom you could feel comfortable talking about anything to without judgement or any of that noise. Someone to help pass time with, joke with, bounce ideas off of, or to go off on adventures with. Whatever's clever.

Should both paties mutually agree that things click well, I am open to the idea of moving to activities together, as well. Movies, hiking, music shows, grabbing dinner, just hanging out, art projects, camping, it's all good to me. My goal here is to develop some new, local, and hopefully strong friendships.

Who would probably jive with me best? Those that don't take themselves seriously and can laugh at just about anything. Those that have a sense of humor. Those who are genuinely curious and enjoy learning new things. Those that enjoy adventure and new experiences. Those that know the difference between an argument and stimulating verbal discourse that involves the exchange of ideas that differ from yours and you can walk away from with an appreciation of something new and different. If you have an appreciation for art and nature, are reasonably fit and enjoy running, hiking, and other outdoor activities, then dont be shy! If you're an artist yourself, salty and humorous language, or you enjoy going to metal shows, then what the hell are you waiting for? If most of that applies to you, then stop dilly-dallying!

That's enough yammering for now. If you read this far, I'll do you a solid in good faith. Simply reply back with something in the subject line that you'd like me to draw for you (think along the lines of what you'd ask to be drawn on a pizza box lid) along with your texterer number in the email body. I will, in return, furiously scribble you a crude drawing with about 5 minutes worth of effort based on your request, and text you a pic of it. Don't expect Picasso. And I'll probably only do it for the first few responses. SO DON'T DAUDLE! Thanks for reading :)

And pardon spelling/grammar. I'm on mobile, and i refuse to proof read this longass crap post.

I am still fairly new to the area as I moved to Centralia last July. Unfortunately, I haven't made any new friends yet so I find myself spending most of my time alone, which is getting old. My ""story"" is a long one but basically my life fell apart several years ago due to chronic pain and I'm still trying to pick myself back up. I'm a good person; no criminal history, not a drug user (not even pot because it doesn't do anything for my pain), although I do enjoy am occasional adult beverage from time to time. Because of my pain, I have not been able to keep a job for the past two years but i am not disabled enough to be legally disabled. I can walk just fine but I find it difficult to stay stationary in any position for a long time. I joined Thorbeckes a month ago and have been using their facility religiously as part of my rehabilitation.

I'm definitely NOT trying to find someone to use or leach off of. I am currently unemployed but that is very likely to change soon since I am looking high and low for a job. We can go do inexpensive or free things for now, like go to parks, go hiking, watch movies or Netflix. 

I put this ad on the Strictly Platonic section because I don't want anyone to expect anything beyond friendship BUT if I meet sometime I am attracted to and they reciprocate that feeling, then maybe we can be more than friends. I just don't want any kind of pressure to ""put out."" I could try making female friends but I've tried that and I just get along better with men. Women seemed to be repelled by me for some reason. 

***PLEASE live within a 20 mile radius of Centralia and be within 5 years older or younger than 35. *** 

Other than that, I'm not too picky. I'm just looking for a fun, easy-going guy to hang out with that won't judge me by my current circumstances.

So I work 6 days a week from 4am to 11pm. Off on Monday's only. Don't have much of a life as you can imagine. I've been doing this for so long that I've forgotten what it was to sit and chat with a lady. Yes what I'm looking for is a LADY, no I'm not interested in sex just harmless chat over coffee, dinner or a glass of wine. Some days I get lucky and can leave work early, and it usually happens when I'm anxious about something and needing someone to talk to. I've noticed that because of my schedule that over the years I've lost all of my friends and can't find anyone to chat with. This makes life very lonely. 

A bit about myself, I'm a workaholic as you probably figured out. I'm well traveled and love the arts. I'm 50 and I'm not much of an athlete but I'm 6' tall and 200 lbs. , I don't think I'm overweight but I'm not a twig either. I think they call it HWP on CL. So if you are interested in some evening chat, maybe a movie, dinner, wine, coffee or the like, drop me a line. BTW anything we do is my treat. It's a cultural thing so don't think because I pick up the check I want anything more than a nice evening with a nice lady. I don't care how old you are just be between 25 and 70. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this and happy life to all.

Greetings all!

I am a dude looking for friends to spend my spare time with. I don't care if you are young or old, male or female, single or married, or a gymnist or a quadriplegic. I always thought friendships should be fostered over some concrete activity so I list out the following things I want to do.

day hike in the Olympic National Park (Once I get to know you, I wouldn't mind camp hiking),

board or card games at either person's house or a tea shop (I have Settlers of Catan),

role play games like DnD or GURPS,

talk over tea or coffee (I literally bought conversation question cards, like the kind at Sabai Thai, so any conversations won't get awkward.),

shoulder rub trade,

walking partner,

build stuff together (I will literally come work on one of your home projects with you, like a wooden deck, for food and/or friendship.),

and/or watching movies together and discussing (I love movies and delving into the symbolism.).

Hey, thanks for clicking on my post. Hopefully this is the first step in making a new friend.. Unfortunately, my work and school schedules are crazy Monday - Thursday, so I'm hoping this will be a good way to meet some new, cool people. BTW, crazy weather we had last night?!?! Should be nice again starting tomorrow (Tuesday). So, I know that this Craig's List and this section isn't really for platonic friends anymore; it used to be but I guess not so much now. However, I still have faith that there are still people out there, like myself, that are just looking for friends. Ok, I moved out here a few years back and I make some really good platonic friends on here back then. Unfortunately, they've either moved away to Ballard (you know some place so far away that they refuse to leave their new The Shire to come back to visit the old one) or they actually moved away (out of the area). Again just to be clear, I'm truly just looking for platonic friends to do stuff with. Absolutely no funny business. Period. I'm a laid back, non-smoking, educated, progressive, ""lefty"", black guy looking to expand my circle. Bottom line, I'm just looking for friends who would be up for grabbing a drink sometime, going to movies, running/jogging, soccer/flag football, working out, hiking, rock climbing and talking. Good conversation is essential; being able to discuss issues [and solutions] in technology, the environment, world events/affairs, non-commerical media, politics (again I'm a proud, educated progressive but very respectful of differing views). I know that's a crazy laundry list, but I'm truly open to meeting new, non-flaky people. If any of this sounds interesting and you're not a flake, please feel free to email me back. Thank you again for clicking and reading. I look forward to melting through the freeze and making some new friends.

I'm looking for all the butterflies and anticipation that comes with a new relationship. Getting to know someone. Becoming attracted to someone. Can't wait for that next time you hear from them. 

Only online. No expectations of meeting face to face. Lots of questions about the other. Talk of everyday life, weather, life, sex and things. 

About me. I am an attractive business professional that is busy but very lonely. I am married and that will not change but I need more. I need to feel alive again. I'm very straight forward and can talk about almost any subject. I'm sexy, funny and like a woman that can make me laugh.

Looking for some new friends and fresh perspective. I am 33 years old.I have spent the greater part of the last 10 years in a monogamous relationship. Out of that I gained two awesome kids. I have spent the last 3 years or so clumsily stepping in and out of the dating scene. I have been through my ""manwhore"" stage, my ""I want another long term partner"" stage and now seem to be in a ""JADED"" state. I have come to the conclusion that this will pass although it's going to take some doing on my part.

So, here I am on Craigslist. . . 

I am into Metal Music and play bass in a metal band that gigs often.
Thats not where my musical taste stops but it definately takes up most of the pallet.
I like outdoor activities such as, but not limited to Sking,fishing,hiking,bonfires, bbqs,biking,swimming,floating rivers and just enjoying nature.
I have a ""Moderately inappropriate"" sense of humor. 
I may or may not offend you but one thing is for sure. I speak my mind.
I am no longer the manwhore I once was and I am STD frrrreeeeee.! (Recently tested)

I am not looking for naked pictures or sexting.
I will also not turn either down 
I will not instigate these activities


I am an open book with many blank pages 

Im open to any type of conversation.

Seeking my online Fantasy Lover

Maybe we are both looking for something to make us feel a little more alive in life? I am looking for something to spark up what has become a non-eventful unexciting life. I am married, but I feel invisible most of the time, the electric sensations of love and sexual intimacy gone. I want to flirt with and exchange hot emails and feel that hot sexual passion again with someone. I am not looking to ever met physically, this is all online and emotionally. . .a fun and playful love affair in our minds. I won't hound you for pictures or phone calls or texts, just all via email.

What I am seeking is an online relationship where we are the naughty secret of each other. I seek a fantasy lover I can flirt with, share intimate secrets with (no matter how bizarre or forbidden or sexual they may be). Someone to make me feel desired again, and someone I can give those same feelings to. Someone that will get tingly feelings and a racing heart when you see you have an email from me. Someone to share our wildest fantasies with, our desires and dreams. I am also open to talking about other things too, anything you want to. Or use me as a shoulder to cry on or bounce ideas off of. I will gladly discuss the good and the bad with you, or most anything. I am open to anything that you want.

I hope I don't sound too weird and this is what you have in mind as well. I'm really pretty normal, slightly crazy but normal with a quirky sense of humor and a libido that has run amuck with raging 'unused' hormones. I want us sharing our experiences and fantasies, I want to arouse you and excite you and make you feel wanted ...craved ,actually by a man. I want you to grow wet thinking about me, the way I grow hard thinking of you. Interested? Tell me more about you. . .describe yourself so I can picture you perfectly in my fantasies about us. ~smile~ Ask me anything and I promise you truthful answers.

I am college educated, fairy successful, funny (quirky, lol), oh yes, and horny, lol. Im open and non-judgmental, your secrets and passions are safe with me sweet girl. Love to know more about you.

Gay 56 y/o male, artistic type (writer, painter, photographer) looking for a new best friend. I moved here from the Midwest two years ago, and the ""best friend"" position is still open.

I live in the U-District. I have a car. But if you live in, say, Vancouver, hanging out would be a challenge. Having just moved from the rural Olympics, I'd like you to live reasonably close the U-District, say a five-mile radius +/-?

I get along famously with younger gay men (25 to 45), but am open to a new friend of any age, really. Romance? Impossible to predict. But I treasure my friendships, both romantic and platonic. I don't flit around between scores of friends. I tend to hunker-down and invest deeply in a smaller number of friendships. Quality not quantity.

I am smart, quirky, funny. I like to talk and to listen; I'm a good listener. That's probably why my ears are so big. My last roommate observed that I regularly ask ""life altering questions."" That made me laugh. But I am a very curious person (which assists me in fiction writing). Almost always in data-collection mode. Some find it stimulating; others find it annoying. But the questions never really stop. Take it as a compliment that I am interested. And I can waste hours meandering through Wikipedia (alone, of course!).

One way I'm modern is I like to invent things, and I tend to be a technology early-adopter, or at least have early awareness of The Next Big Thing. I'm definitely not afraid to try new things. One way I'm old-fashioned: last Sunday I threw my modern smartphone out a car window onto I-5 South, near one of the casinos (yes, litter bug, just this once, 1,000 apologies). If my smartphone landed in the path of your car, a second 1,000 apologies. It was one of my ""mad as Hell and not going to take it any more"" moments. (Only old guys will get that movie reference. Yes, I'm gay and I like movies.)

But I don't enjoy the impatience and narcissism of texting (esp. in myself), and the rudeness when we are glancing at our phones every few minutes. That rudeness can damage a relationship -- like the death of 1,000 paper cuts.

So you could say I have one foot planted in the 21st century (some would say 22nd) and one foot planted firmly in the 20th.

Some examples of how I tend to be a tad TOO FAR into the future: I tried to invent what is today's Angie's List several years before Angie did. Damn that woman. I thought of what is known as YouTube more than a decade before it was created. Timing (and capital) are everything. I should have been one of the YouTube billionaires. If only I was a programmer.

I have a lot of life experience, lived through a lot. A lot of successes and more failures than I would have chosen, but we learn most from our failures, right? I feel like I have one more great game to play (vocational) between ages 56 and 70. So I feel like my best days are still ahead of me. Did you know more millionaires are made in their 50s than any other decade of age group? But money does not drive me anymore. If it comes, fine. I'm starting what the late Dr. Wayne Dyer (RIP) called The Senior Statesman part of life. Where I use everything I learned in my first 56 years to do something profoundly good.

Most of my career has been in public relations or photojournalism. This preoccupation with an occupation in art is new (well, old but dormant since high school). But some of my art is pretty good. My photos are widely published, and I just sold three paintings. Actually SOLD them! Imagine.

I was once married to a woman, and I have two grown wonderful children as a result. One of them is about to have my first grandchild. The reality won't sink-in until I hold the baby. But I do love babies and little kids. I love dogs and cats, too. Esp. cats.

I hope you are healthy enough to dance and take long walks or bike rides. Or join me on the occasional 2,000 foot climb of Mount Walker, south of my beloved Port Townsend, WA. Or sail. But I do not care if you have some dents and dings, some physical or mental challenges, or even HIV. (I do not happen to have HIV, but I am my supportive of my friends who do. In the late 1990s I let a research hospital do tests on me as part of the long search for an AIDS vaccine. It's unfinished business for the gay community.)

If appearance is important in your close friends, I am tall with broad shoulders (two), blue eyes (two), not esp. fat, and I am very white. Some hair is left (brown-gray), some has left for good. Pic-for-pic, as they say. But this needn't be predicated on appearance. This is a close friend I'm looking for.

If any of this appeals to you, please write. Best wishes y'all.

Hey!

My names Era or Nya. I'm 19 years old and new to this area. :) I'm fun loving and I literally love everyone but being new it gets lonely.

So here's what I'm looking for (A non - sexual relationship and please don't be a creep):

1. Dog lover/owner. I have a 4 month old named Distance and an ignorant cat named Patriot. I'd like a buddy that's into walking and hiking with their pets but I have some physical limitations for a while. :)

2. I'm an upcoming model and I'm also into photography, dance and acting. (If you're a photography student that's a bonus. I'll let you take pics of me to use in your portfolio if you let me use them for mine.

3. I love cooking and so be a foodie. 

4. I hope you love to laugh and are a little immature. Ha I am. I'm the type that still loves pillow fights, chasing each other with squirt guns, pranks, dancing around the kitchen in PJs and play fighting/wrestling/tickling.

5. I am competitive so if you are into video games that's a bonus.

6. I love traveling. And later on down the road I'd love to have a buddy to explore Europe with someone.

If this in anyway describes you hit me up. There so much more to me than this and I'd love a best friend (male or female) to share life with. Please be my age (18 -27).

I'm 110% real and serious. I'd like to talk over the phone, get a feel for each other and then meet at a public place such as Starbucks.

Change the headline to your passion in life like fishing or photography as well as a pic. I'll send you a pic back. 

Thank you,

Era, Distance and Patriot

Let's get to know each other as friends, perhaps enjoying wine-tastings, concerts, walks by the water and hiking/ walks in the park, dinner and/or drinks out (or in, when that feels right). Share some fun pursuits together. Can you believe all that in one package? Yep. True.

Where do you live? How old are you? What is your name? lets start with the basics:-) 

I'd love to see a photo and know something about you. Looks are less important to me than the connection factor, mutual respect and compatibility.

Honestly, I miss giving massages too...I would love to find someone who would be willing to let me practice my massages on them. I especially enjoy giving foot massages. Obviously this will also include talking and if it leads to more, like a relationship, I am open to that. Open to any age, ethnicity, or body type. NO GUYS! Also, you need to host, but I will travel to you. If you are interested, please shoot me an email about yourself and what you are looking for. Please include a pic for mine and change the subject line to your favorite hobby. Yes I am real, my weekend was spent watching Final Four basketball. Hope to hear from you soon :)

hi there.

The title says it all. I'm just looking for some sexy chat/pic swap with another lady. 
Let me just say this (because some people can't read): I AM NOT INTERESTED IN GUYS. Don't waste your time. That said, if you're gonna fake it - fake it well enough that i can't tell. 
I'm also not looking to meet up. Had some scary encounters/stalkers. This will all stay online. You won't convince me otherwise.

Not looking to talk, but we can email or Kik. I'm just really horny (pretty much all the time) and want to chat with other gorgeous women. I absolutely love dirty talk. ;) 

Please be 21 or older. 

To prove you're not a bot, put ""yellow jackrabbit"" as the subject title when you reply. That will tell me you're 1) not a bot and 2) able to read. :)


Talk to you soon.

Please send a picture with your response and I'll send one also.

I have no preference other than age range 33-50?

Have a great day.

Hey! 
My name Is Teara, I am 19 And have been searching for a chick friend since I moved here from Oregon (I was 16) because of how many schools i was moved to and getting my own place I have not found anyone, Me and my boyfriend and all his friends spend every day together but as you can imagine hanging with a bunch of stoner dudes means many things. While we still have fun and play video games and whatever they don't like doing things such as 1. Shopping 2. Dancing and being silly while blasting music. 3. going on walks and being active. And lastly... 4. They cant relate to my stupid woman problems xD I am not overly dramatic though so please if you love getting up in peoples business and starting shit, stay far away. aaaaanyways, I have a very alternative style, I have piercings and I color my hair very often. (visiting Sally's is a regular occurrence) I listen to punk rock, rock, alternative, electronic and some rap ( basically just no country) so hopefully you are not too into hunting and wearing Camo... or wearing Romeos xD I am also looking for someone to workout with for I am 5'4 and 160 pounds... not too bad but I would like to be 145 again :P Its been really hard not having a job and trying to eat healthy as well, soooo if you have any tips about that, or maybe know some one who can hire me would be nice too :P 

Please don't be over 25..
Please don't shove your religion down my throat (I believe that anything is possible and will talk for hours about where we COULD come from and how we all could be connected, but these are theories, ill never blindly believe in ANYTHING not even Jesus, so please if you are christian I have a billion theories why your god might not exist so get ready to hear it if you try to shove your ""faith"" in my face. 
Please love to be blunt and open
speaking of blunt...
Please be 420 friendly, you don't have to smoke it, but don't be hating on it either. 
please don't be an alcoholic or drug addict 
Please! Email me! I would love to know more about you! NO GUYS!!!
send me a pic and state your name and age also what you like to do! (PS. Please don't reply if you don't live close to south everett area, I want someone to chill with alot.. and I am sharing a car with my bf currently and he has it most the time)

I grew up being the person who was always there for my friends - a trait I've carried over into adulthood. The friend you could call at 3am even if you just needed to talk to someone who cares ... the friend you could tell your darkest secrets to, who wouldn't judge ... the crazy, sarcastic, class clown who could crack you up or make you shoot milk (or beer) out your nose with laughter when you needed it most.

I'm a writer, gay male, who has always believed in the power of dreams ... provided you don't only leave them as dreams, but instead pursue them into reality. Even if you fail, it's so much better than not having tried at all. For that reason I have published my writing, acted on stage and in film and on TV (minor stuff, for real, but still) been to the top of both the Sears Tower and the Statue of Liberty, and even worked at Jurassic Park. To quote Julia Roberts in 'Steel Magnolias': ""I'd rather have five minutes of something special than a lifetime of nothing at all.""

All this life, all this doing my best to be there for others, has in turn taken a toll on me, and I hope to seek friends in Seattle. I'm relocating there in about two weeks, looking to get where I can sort of heal myself spiritually, physically, and mentally ... to get back to remembering that importance of living live day to day instead of feeling like you are always racing some clock you can never catch.

Seeking friends, creative or not, who are sincere, smart, understand the true meaning of friendship, and who also like to laugh. Probably a lot. Someone who appreciates good conversation and a ton of sarcasm, as well. Age, race, gender, what you look like - none of that matters as much as the person you are inside. 

Just ... looking for friends who are for real. Thanks for reading.

I have found that making friends when you live out in the woods is difficult as there are not a lot of people here. My day to day interaction with people is limited except when I go into town. So, I am trying to build a diverse circle of friends with whomx I could expand my small spot in the world.

Here is a bit about me. I have no children but do enjoy them. I have two Boxers that I spoil rotten. I like to cook . I enjoy taking spontaneous day trips. . I have a passion for learning and am always interested in new and different things. I love going to fairs and festivals, (the tulip festival was outs ""Harry Potter"" series, second hand shopping is a favorite activity, , binging on Netflix on lazy days, I do a lot of paper crafting, mostly greeting cards, I take care of my chickens and turkeys. I live on a 20+ acre timber tree farm between Snohomish and Granite falls. My home landscape is surrounded by trees. I love it here, it is so peaceful. I am from Los Angeles, corporate America, and retired to WA 9 years ago. I'm 54 but on most days I feel younger or older, but then again, what does 54 feel like? My friends come from all age groups from 22 to 85. I don't care about your age, or what you look like or your sexual preference, these things should not be issues between friends. Let's just be friends and contribute to the quality of each othrs lives.

I'm looking for a fun and friendly female to go do things with. Food, hiking, road trips, adventures, pretty much up for anything. I'm 28, professional, and normal. Looking for a women who is around my age and is in decent shape so to be able to be active. 

Romance is not the goal here. If it turns into that once a friendship develops that would be awesome but a cool chick to hang out with is really all I'm looking for.

I look forward to the messages :)

I have been in the area for a while now but I haven't taken the time to make friends outside of work and I think it's time to. I am 27 years old, married, no kids and in the army.

I am looking for a person that would like to hang out in the afternoons during the week and whenever on the weekends. I am drug free but I do drink on occasion.

I live in Lacey and it seems most of my friends have moved away. So I am looking to meet some new ones, women or men. I would like to find some friends who like to walk, or go out for a while after work or on the weekends, maybe just hang out together. I like to dine out or go to movies, lots of different activities, rock hounding, drink beer sometimes and am 420 friendly, female, mid-50s, 5'6"", hwp. I am not religious. I am open minded for the most part.

I am not into conspiracy theories, don't use 420 and not a heavy drinker. I would like to talk about psychology subjects. I have a rule though, we both get to talk an equal amount of time, so, you talk for around five minutes and then I follow up, and we don't necessarily need to give feedback unless wanted. 

I know women are concerned about these things even though they say they're not: I'm a relatively normal man with above average attractiveness and like to stay as healthy as I can.

I'm not thin, but am attempting to lose weight. I'm a white BBW, 230 pounds and 5'4"". Blonde hair, blue/green eyes. I'm an average on the attractive scale. I'm interested in real people, no matter the size, color, whatever. I'm not interested in 420, just not my thing. I'm clean and want to stay that way.

I will send pictures if you do. I want to hear about you. 35 is too dang old to not have any friends and question my sexuality. Help me figure this out.

I discharged honorably from the Army National Guard a couple of years ago and have been having difficulty getting back on my feet. I'm currently staying at a homeless shelter in downtown Seattle, hoping to find somewhere to stay temporarily while I get back to work and relocate out of state.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in the mid-90's, have no criminal record, and don't drink or use illegal drugs. I own only what I can carry so my life is very simple at this point. I have no family nor children and no support network around me, so I'm hoping to meet new friends who might have a place for me to store a few bags and a corner in which to sleep.

I'm physically fit, very easy-going, and able to help out with chores or yardwork etc. in exchange for help. I'm open to any and all suggestions. Thanks!

Howdy balloo~

I'm a transplant from the little island of Guam. :) Moved here last year after a bit of school, Navy, and travel, and I still find it difficult to find a human, yet alone someone who isn't afraid to talk, get easily offended, or make new buddies. My style of friendship? Someone who's in it for the long run and values friendship as much as I do!

My interests vary from old school anime, Game of Thrones, Bob's Burgers, Borderlands the Pre-Sequel, adventuring, coffee dates, drawing, and much more. I promise not to overwhelm you with my weirdness, but if you embrace it, we won't have any issues. ^^ 

ANYwho! Give me a hollah' if you wanna bro out, or even simply grab a cup of coffee and chitchat. 

P.S.
If you dig 80s movie nights, Netflix binging on random movies, and spontaneous fun, then we should seriously talk. Lol.

Cheers~

Not sure why our last post got flagged.
Anyways, My fiance and I are looking for drinking buddies.
Most of our friends are older and don't really like to party.
We aren't supper crazy or anything. 
Just looking for people to play beer pong and hang out with.
We do have a daughter, So going out is difficult for us most of the time.
Although we can on occasion, We have our own place and a nice set up with multiple tables.
Not into drugs at all, 420 is ok. We normally do but at the moment don't smoke ourselves.
Basically looking for respectful people, man, woman, or couple. 
If your interested feel free to either email me or message me on kik.

My name's Myfi! 

I'm a bit afraid of meeting new people, but I'm very friendly once I'm given the chance to get comfortable, I love to bake (and I will shunt many food-gifts upon you if you'll let me), I love tea , movies and animals(this includes reptiles. I own two. Be not afraid). 

I am generally relatively low-energy due to being out of shape and various other reasons, but if you have ideas for things to do I'm up for a fair amount of things! I am very blunt and fairly snarky, but I am an excellent listener and if you need someone to talk to about ANYTHING, I will sit and be a shoulder to lean on and will give generally sage advice upon being asked. I do have a long-term dedicated partner and we tend to spend our weekends together, so all of my free time is during the day (8am to 4pm) during the week. I also have the added benefit of having an adorable puppy who is SUPER high-energy and looking for routine playmates!

I do not drive, so relative closeness or a willingness to drive to me is wonderful, though I am equally content to make phone-friends or online friends! 

I'm not christian or religious and as long as you don't try to convert me I have no issues!
I am very libertarian and pro gun, so gun control supporters probably shouldn't apply. I'm incredibly prickly about being able to protect myself and equalize the playing field, as weak as I am physically.
I love all music except for rap. When I say all music, I mean everything from rock to metal to electronic to classical and opera to jazz and swing to disney music. As long as it's not Let It Go we'll get along great. I'm a bit of a budding audiophile as well!

I have a massive appreciation of nature which is a little ironic being that I've not been able to get out in it anywhere near as much as I'd like. 

The only thing I partake of to any degree is alcohol, and I'm insanely picky about it. I don't particularly have issues with anything you may or may not do, with the preference that if it's something illicit you not do it around me! I'm fine with pot smokers as well, but I ask it not be smoked around me(at least in an area where I would get the smell on me) as my partner is very sensitive and it would cause him to have severe nosebleeds :)

I'm told that I am a very giving and wonderful friend by what few I have scattered across the states and other countries! I'm fine with platonic snuggles and the like if and once you are(because who doesn't like to dogpile during movies, right? Especially when there's a cute pup!)

I mostly dream of raising tons of adorable baby animals, from reptiles to birds to mammals to insects! I am also obsessed with aircraft and many of the other Nicer Things With Engines that exist. Physics is good shit.

I miss married people. I'm separated on the fast track to a divorce, so I've been living single for awhile now. But, I'll be honest, I miss all my married folks I used to know when I was married.

And, to be honest, I need a friend. I'm not insane, I'm stable as all get out (employed, no debt, pay my own rent) but I'm not finding the connections I want out there. I tend to get other married people.

Let's face it, at our age, there are a lot of us whose body parts aren't cooperating. My knees are killing me:-( And due to a drug given to my mother during her pregnancy with me, my intimate parts don't work correctly anymore. It has stopped me from posting in the romantic section. But I miss male companionship and affection. We both just see our malfunctioning body parts as a natural part of the aging process of life instead of a loss, and neither one of us is going to let that stop us from having a close, loving, fun, long-term relationship. I'm 63 years of age, 5' 5"", divorced, have waste long brown hair, a few more pounds than I would like (but not obese), very healthy (no high blood pressure, no high cholesterol, no diabetes). Things that I like to do: I love live shows of all kinds (plays, comedy, opera, concerts, restaurants with live music, etc.), science (especially archaeology, and astronomy), museums, the beach, Sunday afternoon trips, cozy warm snuggling by the fire, cuddling while watching a movie, good wine, ethnic restaurants and dancing. Hoping to spend some of the winter months in Hawaii or Arizona in three years when I retire. Want to visit Egypt and Italy, and would love to explore the U.S. in an RV someday (I especially love the Southwest). I am happy, secure and independent. I love going out with my friends and won't give that up, but miss the companionship and affection of a man. Most importantly, we both love to laugh! If you think you want to try to make me laugh, tell me something about yourself and send me a photo. I will send you a photo and more about myself, if I think there will be a connection (no photo, no reply). PLEASE no drugs, no alcoholics, no diseases, no smoking, no married men, NO LIARS, NO CRAZIES and have employment or a secure retirement. PLEASE live within 30 minutes of Lynnwood and be between 59 and 68. You may think I am very picky, but I like my life, so I am just looking for someone who will make it a little better. Be within my criteria or don't contact me, thank you for cooperating.

Hey There :)

Like they say - Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars

First off, I'm married and started wondering recently what else might be out there. While I have no intention of leaving, it would be fun to meet someone in a similar situation--wondering what it's like on the other side of the fence - the passion, the personality, and feelings. Maybe some excitement, intrigue, suspense, and the feel of our beating hearts. I'm looking for someone to teach me something new about life. Bonus points if you've kept your body fit, mind young, imagination alive, and face smiling. I love woman of all ages - so please don't be bashful about being either older or younger. Try me :-)

No drama required, a healthy drive for passion is mutual,...... All within the confines of just the two of us knowing. My description of the perfect affair partner is someone that is married, is attractive, has a sense of humor, and is intelligent.

I'm very fit and attractive, the discreet nature of the post is why I haven't put a picture. Once we have chatted a little more I'd be happy to exchange. I'm a business professional, well educated and very stable financially.

I want a woman that will stick around for a while. If you do, I promise I'll give you plenty in return! If you meet have the above qualities, I'd love to hear from you.

Dear Craigslist:

Before I start in on my question for all y'all, I just want to say a big Thanks. 4 months ago or so, I posted here about being lonely and about being utterly confused about the direction my life had taken. Almost uniformly, I got positive, thoughtful responses from you CL men, and it brought me so much comfort and I was incredibly grateful for the kindness. I'm really hoping you'll read about my idea/dilemma again and let me know your thoughts.

The situation: I'm single, and I've been single for a really long time. There are more reasons for why this is so than I care to list or you care to read about, but the reason I do want to mention is one that's pretty fundamental to a woman's success in dating: I'm not conventionally attractive. I'm 5'4"" but I weigh 155lbs - which is just a little too heavy for most of the guys I hang out with (i.e. very social, active, educated guys who are themselves conventionally attractive.) I also don't carry this weight particularly well; it sits on my upper body rather than distributing evenly or going to my butt. While I know that the path to happiness involves self-acceptance - and believe me, I am pretty good at being self-accepting - I also know it involves becoming the best version of yourself. The best version of me is about 20 - 30lbs lighter than I am currently. If I get to that lower weight, not only will I look better on the outside, I'll feel better on the inside.

I'm doing most of the right things to be healthy and lose a little weight - I love fruits and veggies, I eat healthy fats, and I love lean protein and I do an average to above average job at avoiding fatty food. I'm active, and frequently run, hike, and play sports with friends. The weight is coming off so slowly, though, that I'm not really making any progress. I know, I know... the answer is to eat less.

If you're still reading, you're probably wondering why I have this listed in the personals section of CL. It's because I think having a cuddle buddy will help me lose weight. I love bear hugs, and I love giving and receiving physical warmth, comfort, and affection. I love having a man I feel comfortable with wrap their arms securely around me. As a chronically single girl, I've never really had anyone it would be appropriate to do this with, and that bothers me. I honestly believe that if I had someone to cuddle with and watch movies with in the evenings, someone who would distract me from food with cuddles and hugs, that I would focus less on the temporary joy that food brings me, and more on feeling physically good and physically connected to that person. I'd also honestly want to look and feel good for that person too. 

So, CL, what do you think? Should I approach a dude friend in my life for this, or would it likely get too emotionally messy for me and him? Should I try and find someone from OKcupid who'd do this for me? Would I be taking advantage or using someone if I found this? Would it inevitably lead to dating and sex? Should I find someone from here and hope that it leads to the kind of chemistry that can give this kind of comfort? How do I find this? Or am I just nuts to think this would ever be a good idea?

Sincerely,
Confused.

I'm not sure how this will go but giving it a shot. I'm looking for a friend. A true friend that will listen and wants to be listened to. I tend to get a long better with females believe it's from me having sisters. Anyways a little about me. I try to be a very positive person. I try my best to be open-minded and definitely non-judge mental. I have a lot of time on my hands because I'm dealing with a central nervous disease. Kinda limits mobility but can still walk! I do however live comfortably so this isn't a charity thing just a simple explanation of why I am so free. I am married not looking to change that but seems so many are turned off by that. I'd love to explain more but as writing is a hobby I may not stop! Hopefully someone good-hearted will reach out! To any that read this hope you all have a great day!

You Know You're a Dog Person When. . ..

•	Nobody's feet are allowed on the furniture, but your dogs are welcome to sleep on any piece they choose .
•	It takes an entirely separate garbage can to handle the poop.
•	All kinds of things around the house are in need of repair, but if your dog needs immediate surgery and out comes the checkbook.
•	You haven't had your annual check up in years, but the dogs are all medically up to date.
•	You're more concerned with the dogs' needs than your own when the budget gets tight. 
•	You can only remember people by associating them with their dog.
•	Your mom calls and asks how the granddogs are.
•	Every gift you ever get has something to do with dogs.
•	You rip up the carpet and lay tile to make clean up so much easier.
•	Your first concern when planning a vacation is whether or not the hotel will take pets.
•	You politely bow out of an important social engagement so you can attend to your dogs.
•	The number one priority when buying a new house is the size and landscape of the backyard. 
•	The cost of boarding your furkids equals that of your entire vacation.
•	Your desk proudly displays your canine family.
•	All dates must pass your dog's inspection.
•	The first question you ask when on a date is: ""So, do you like dogs?"" 
•	You break down and buy another pillow so you can have one to sleep on.
•	More than half your grocery money goes to dog food and treats.
•	You send out especially-made holiday cards that feature you and the dogs.
•	Your spouse issues the ultimatum: ""It's them or me!"" and you have no problem pointing out the suitcase.
•	Your dogs eat only the most nutritionally sound food, while your favorite meal is mac'n cheese.
•	You've just spent $60 on groceries and realize none of it is for yourself. 
•	Your ""Welcome"" sign has a dog on it. 
•	You have a kiddy wading pool in the yard, but no small children. 
•	You have baby gates permanently installed at strategic places around the house, but no babies. 
•	Poop has become a source of conversation for you and your significant other. 
•	Your dog sleeps with you. 
•	You like people who like your dog. You despise people who don't. 
•	You talk about your dog the way other people talk about their kid. 
•	You put an extra blanket on the bed so your dog is more comfortable. 

How many of these can you relate to? Anything you can add to this list?

It would be nice to have a friend who can understand and relate to life with dogs!

If you made it past the headline title, thank you.

I'm just a regular human being like everyone else, but different. In a positively good way! :) For those who aren't familiar with the transgender spectrum, I am a female at birth, currently transitioning into male. I am looking to see what's out there, willing to accept me for who I am! I am sarcastically goofy and I laugh at the most randomly dumbest things to exist! I'm very old school, sensitive in my own ways, old fashioned at heart, and my respect morals for people in general are reflective upon it.

I love animals, my family, my job, late night conversations, a cold beer after a long hectic day, sunsets, clear nights with the moon glowing, cooking, singing and dancing like no one's around, staying up having movie marathons, hiking, football, music from the 60's through the mid 90's, photography, being by the water etc.

Hopefully there's an awesome lady out there that would love to be my friend! Thanks again for taking the time to read a snippet of who I am!

If you enjoy direct and are non judgemental then read on....

I have two quandaries. 1. I am skeptical/paranoid/pessimistic about posting. 2. Which category to post under. 

I prefer to find someone married who would share the same concerns. She would be a a great discrete friend. A women who can blend easily and surprise you too. 

I want to flirt maybe do some sexting and share some candid pictures but I don't know if I would ever stray further then that? Most certainly, I want to meet for lunches or errands and play dates and text when our schedules don't work out. 

I am blue eyed, great body, look a decade younger, and ridiculously over educated. 

Are you similar or a uncannily perfect fitting compliment? Then write, I'm always plugged in.....

Ha that can mean so many things, I don't think I will edit that last sentence and leave you laughing ...

I am a married 56-year-old straight man. I'm at a point in my life where it feels like I've just awakened from a dream only to find that the dream bears only some correlation to reality. Specifically, my wife decided, without discussion, with me anyway, to open her side of our marriage. Did not see that coming. Or perhaps I did and had no clue what to do about it. We are currently living apart and are in counseling.

I am not here to find women to bitch about my wife to nor garner sympathy for my plight. I am not looking for sex as part of a vendetta against her and her partners. That's why I'm posting in this section vs others. I am here, sincerely, to try and find friends to email with, at first, perhaps phone conversations, and, if we sense some sort of connection, meet face-to-face, share a meal or a cup of coffee. Simply that, without expectations, strings or entanglement. With honesty, laughter and the sharing of stories. 

If you're curious, physical and other attributes can be seen in the grid to the right. I am not comfortable with putting a photo here and truthfully, sharing an image isn't something that would happen until we've communicated for awhile. 

Other, perhaps more interesting facts about me include a 30+ year in a local industry. I live in a house. There are no children or any other people living here. I don't drink, haven't for a very long time and don't mind if you do (within reason). I enjoy music, especially the blues, and my tastes are broad. 

If you've read this far, perhaps something about what little I've shared about my story and my desire for friendship will move you to respond.

I'm looking forward to it!

Hey, today was really rough for me and I've decided I need to start making friends. I'm very shy when you first get to know me. Im really sure how to phrase these things so bare with me lol. 
Some things I'm into are cars, weed, animals, good food, Netflix. I'm very laid back. But I have ptsd and I get tachycardia a lot. The past few years have been pretty rough, and I havent really been going out much at all. And I need to change that. I foster animals (mostly kittens, sometimes puppies) for the king county animal shelter. 

What I'm looking for right now is someone to smoke with. A ""420 friend"" as my mom put it lol, I have my greencard. Or just someone to exchange snapchats for now, (I don't like talking everyday and I'm not clingy at all. You have to be laid back) maybe hang out down the road when it gets sunny. 
If you grow weed it'd be awesome to learn somethings. Im starting an urban agriculture program tomorrow. 
I mainly dab because it's the bestest. Also blunt wrappers make my mouth too numb idk.

Intelligent, educated, professional, WM with a truly wicked sense of humor and a flair for the erotic, seeks an e-buddy to build synergy and to resonate with.

I get bored as hell at work because I do the same thing over and over. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me out of the loony bin is chatting it up...texting, email, IM, talking on the phone...Hell it could be smoke signals (no, not THAT kind of smoke), carrier pigeons, or bongo drums and I'd still enjoy it.

What I'm looking for is to make a connection...To have that spark happen when intelligent conversation and flirting are mixed together with the rush of meeting somebody new. BOOM! Explosive?...Oh hell yes! I love it!

So then what happens, you ask. Well, I'm separated and I'm definitely not looking to change anybody's situation while I figure out mine. I'm really not expecting that we hook up, date, or even meet for an ice cream sundae at a church social (I've never done it in a church, lol...Have you?). At the end of the day, I'm just hoping to find a gal pal who both enjoys some male attention and giving a guy that same attention. Anything beyond that...let's cross that bridge if we ever get to it.

So let's talk about you: A woman (sorry guys, nothing personal, I just don't swing that way), 40-60 (the age is just a suggestion because we're likely to have more in common...but if you're under 40 or over 60 and you think you're up for the challenge, then by all means). Race, looks, religion, occupation, politics, astrological sign, blood type, favorite football team, etc etc are unimportant. Marital status...that's an interesting one. I prefer you to be married or divorced...But, as with the age, if you think you're up for it, then by all means.

A.) A woman who has a sense of humor as warped and irreverent as mine (You can laugh at almost anything).

B.) A woman who doesn't need me to carry the conversation all the time (aka isn't afraid to speak her mind).

C.) A woman with something going on upstairs (aka you know what synergy and resonance mean...or at least you're motivated enough to crack the dictionary).

D.) You're a fan of flirting and being flirted with. If you DON'T, let's not waste each others time.

Turn Off's:
A:) If you're somebody who thinks that bored people are boring, then carry your ass, sister. You're probably a princess and I don't need the headache.

B.) Likewise if you're going to be offended by my self confidence and think it's arrogance or conceit. If that's offensive or threatening, keep moving. There's plenty of gals who like self confidence in a man.

C.) Ditto on preaching about morality. If I want a lecture, I'll go to the aforementioned church and try that ice cream sundae.

D.) Nit Pickers. See A, Princess types for details. I'm not here to try and fix what's wrong with anybody and I sure don't need somebody doing it to me.

The rest of you gals, crack that dictionary, look up synergy, and drop me a line ;)

Let's face it, at our age, there are a lot of us whose body parts aren't cooperating. My knees are killing me:-( And due to a drug given to my mother during her pregnancy with me, my intimate parts don't work correctly anymore. It has stopped me from posting in the romantic section. But I miss male companionship and affection. We both just see our malfunctioning body parts as a natural part of the aging process of life instead of a loss, and neither one of us is going to let that stop us from having a close, loving, fun, long-term relationship. I'm 63 years of age, 5' 5"", divorced, have waste long brown hair, a few more pounds than I would like (but not obese), very healthy (no high blood pressure, no high cholesterol, no diabetes). Things that I like to do: I love live shows of all kinds (plays, comedy, opera, concerts, restaurants with live music, etc.), science (especially archaeology, and astronomy), museums, the beach, Sunday afternoon trips, cozy warm snuggling by the fire, cuddling while watching a movie, good wine, ethnic restaurants and dancing. Hoping to spend some of the winter months in Hawaii or Arizona in three years when I retire. Want to visit Egypt and Italy, and would love to explore the U.S. in an RV someday (I especially love the Southwest). I am happy, secure and independent. I love going out with my friends and won't give that up, but miss the companionship and affection of a man. Most importantly, we both love to laugh! If you think you want to try to make me laugh, tell me something about yourself and send me a photo. I will send you a photo and more about myself, if I think there will be a connection (no photo, no reply). PLEASE no drugs, no alcoholics, no diseases, no smoking, no married men, NO LIARS OR LUNITICS, and have employment or a secure retirement. PLEASE live within 30 minutes of Lynnwood and be between 59 and 68. You may think I am very picky, but I like my life, so I am just looking for someone who will make it a little better. If you are not within my requested age range or distance, please don't bother me.

No I am not crazy I am former military and law enforcement. They are the Seatco what you white eyes call bigfoot and what we call stick Indians or ""sasquatch"". They can speak and understand. I have encountered them since 2009 and earned their trust so far. Others have seen them in 2012 and will not return with me. I leave them food and play music for them. If you are brave, not scream or bolt then you will learn much about them. No BS, drama as I am for real. Others are not serious. I have no ""takers"" so far. Let me know if you are serious.

I have found that making friends when you live out in the woods is difficult as there are not a lot of people here. My day to day interaction with people is limited except when I go into town. So, I am trying to build a diverse circle of friends with whom I could expand my small spot in the world.

Here is a bit about me. I have no children but do enjoy them. I have two Boxers that I spoil rotten. I like to cook . I enjoy taking spontaneous day trips. . I have a passion for learning and am always interested in new and different things. I love going to fairs and festivals, (the tulip festival was outs ""Harry Potter"" series, second hand shopping is a favorite activity, , binging on Netflix on lazy days, I do a lot of paper crafting, mostly greeting cards, I take care of my chickens and turkeys. I live on a 20+ acre timber tree farm between Snohomish and Granite falls. My home landscape is surrounded by trees. I love it here, it is so peaceful. I am from Los Angeles, corporate America, and retired to WA 9 years ago. I'm 54 but on most days I feel younger or older, but then again, what does 54 feel like? My friends come from all age groups from 22 to 85. I don't care about your age, or what you look like or your sexual preference, these things should not be issues between friends. Let's just be friends and contribute to the quality of each othrs lives.

I can't believe that's a real word. I thought Disney made it up!

Anyway, I've been hermit'ing most of the winter (and last year) but am finally feeling better enough to poke my head out and see what's going on! The warmer days and the sun are doing their best to convince me it's roadtrip season... buuuut I'm getting kind of tired of roadtripping alone. I'm thinking the Tulip Festival before April is over, perhaps a trip up to Canada (beyond Vancouver) for 4th of July weekend, and... whatever else catches my / my new friend's fancy!

The main thing is that my new BFF and I are comfortable with / can talk to each other. I'm weird, I know it, and I've had a looooong time to come to terms with it. Nonetheless, I have my good points. I'm a good listener and I have pretty good cheering-up skills. I'm quiet when I have nothing to say. Occasionally I give good advice. I can be witty and funny. I'm self-sufficient. I would say something about having a car, but it's nearly 20 years old, so...

I work hard and get dedicated when I put my mind to it and sometimes its just a lot easier when you have a workout buddy to keep you in check, or better yet, keep each other in check.

How about a scene upon Norwegian Cruise Lines, Maiden of the Seas? Its our 15 year anniversary trip and I thought it would be good to get you away for a while. Of course, after 15 years, we have sort of settled into a bit of a rut, but lately we've been spicing it up with some interesting conversations regarding wife sharing. To my complete surprise, you didn't drop your jaw on the ground or run off in a huff when I casually mentioned that I'd had a dream about it. But until this point it has all just been talk. However on our 2nd day headed to the Bahamas, the boat is still 8 hrs from the next port of call. You are lying in a lounge chair by the pool and I'm trying my hand at some blackjack at the casino. My phone buzzes and its a text from you. ""Hey, remember what we had been discussing...your dream that you brought up?"" Me: ""Yeah, what about it?"" then a pic arrives on my text. It's a guy in swim trunks standing by the edge of the pool with a towel over his head as he's drying his hair. What is unmistakeable is the enormous outline in his tight, wet trunks. 

me: ""Good greif, monster at sea"" I respond.

Is there anyone nearby wanting to put in an effort to learn American Sign Language, Spanish or some other language with me while the weather is bad. You could teach me how to dance and I can teach you how to draw stick people :( Maybe do some outdoor activities later this spring and summer? I need to make some changes to my lifestyle and if you need to do the same say hi. I am laid back, non-judgmental, have a positive outlook on life and can enjoy most things with the right person. I'm looking for someone near Hoodsport. It shouldn't matter for friendship/activity acquaintance but the picture was taken Feb. 11, 2016 not in 2009.


If this is still up then I'm still looking for others to do things with.

I am looking for a lifetime friend. I dont get out much in social situations, I am kind of a loner. So I figure chances are maybe someone out there is also thinking craigslist might be a good place to find a friend. Or maybe someone is looking for someone like me. I am a complicated person, I dont get along with many people. I am a female, but I consider myself to be genderfluid, It has been a very long time since I have been with a women, I am in a commited relationship. But I am looking for a female friend that I can be friends with for a very long time, while at the same time we could have w on w time and then maybe bring you in to be apart of a threesome with my boyfriend. I am not dishosest or a liar but I am a private person, my boyfriend knows I am doing this but know one else does and I would like to keep it that way, so your picture gets mine if you are interested. I am looking for someone who is bisexual and could fool around or do a threesome eventually one day. If you cant ever see that happening please dont respond. 

I am the best of both sides. I love outdoor activitys such as hiking, camping, fishing, rock hounding, long walks, biking, swimming. Other things such as photography, video games, all forms of creativity, drawing, coloring, creating, writing, gardening, sewing, cooking. While I can get down and dirty in the mud and withstand the pain. I can also be girly and like to dress up and take pictures and go out. I love animals and plants especially more than most things in life. 

I have been on a path to enlightenment, I do struggle with depression and anxiety, but I am looking for someonme who is positive and not interested in creating or fueling drama. I have been working on fixing my own inner problems for some time, I do fairly well on my own. I am a great listener and can listen and give advice if you have troubles. But no unnessisary drama, I am confident and a secure person with myself and my body. I have been taking steps to better my body while I have been bettering my mind. I am not a hater and I dont need them in my life. 

I plan on doing a lot of camping this year and it would be nice to have a female friend to bring along. I am not interested in doing a threesome right away, this is mostly for a friendship where that could be possible. I am a bit chunky but I am porportaniate. I dont have many preferances to what you look like as long as you can keep up with me.

I like to think I am funny, adventurous, laid back. I find the smallest and most unusal things entertaining. I know I am a strange person but that doesnt stop me. I work 5 days a week and my hours are flip floppy but I like to go on long walks around my neighborhood. I dont mind doing things around the house every now and then too. The weather is no obstacle for me, I will go out in any of it for a walk or anything really. I love living life, I think everyone should experience most things at least once, I am very 420 friendly, I go to hempfest every year and various other festivals. I dont do hard drugs and I drink occasionally. I love listening to interesting music and I have been teaching myself to dance. My boyfriend and I are very adventurous together, we enjoy going to parks or the outdoors and finding places to have sex. That would be a very big plus to be able to do that with my good friend one day. The three of us doing naughty things in public nature. 

I have had and lost many friendships in my life just from compatibility problems. I am very open and non bias, I can feel comfortable talking about just about anything. I am very opinionated but I dont try to shove them down your throte, its ok for people to have their own opinions. We can start by just emailing or hanging out. If I seem like the type of person you would like to be friends with, I promise you wont regret it. 

If your interested please inquire with your favorite animal as the title. And I will get back to you.

Basically want a best friend, or someone to drink with after a shitty day or long day, or a Tuesday. Kinda did a recent cleaning of my life, and that left it pretty empty since most friends were kinda old, so we outgrew each other in some ways. 

Everyone says they want like a ride or die friend? I'm SO that friend, I'd totally be down to go for a drive at 3 am. I don't drive, but I could provide snacks for aforementioned 3 am drive. I'm a great listener, so totally fine to vent to about shitty stuff/people. Umm, Iunno, talking about yourself is weird. SO! 

About this, 

I'm single, 25, kinda have depression, but I'm slowly getting over it, most days. fine with an adventure (3 am or pm) but also good with vegging in front of Netflix with a blanket fort.

You Single, around 25ish, depression or at least knows what it is, likes adventure and vegging in front of Netflix, smokes sometimes, maybe kindaish. Maybe have animals, or like them. :D

Hi I'm a married mother in her early 20s. i have 3 kids under 7 and I don't know many people in this area and its been hard for me to meet new people. I guess I just feel like an outcast among mothers once they find out how old i am, given I had my first child at 18. I kind of feel like other moms who are older look at me like I must not be a good mother because of my age and amount of children. I'm in a weird spot as most people my age dont have kids, or are becoming first time moms. 
So i guess i am just seeking friends who are accepting of me as a responsible younger mother. My typical day involves trips to the park, arts and crafts, reading books, taking the kids to sports and once they are asleep working on my own homework (I am also a college student) ... During my free time (typically weekends only) I enjoy movies, hiking, going to the gym, singing and music, shopping and wine. 
Alright. that is all :)

Hello there,

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I know our time is our most precious commodity. 

I was hoping to find a neat friend to talk with throughout the day on Kik. Shoot the breeze, vent and generally get to know each other. We can talk, debate and discuss such things as silly as ridiculous bumper stickers to sports to how you can pretty much make anything in a crock pot. To more serious matters like plans for the future and what to each other is watching on Netflix. 

If we hit it off we could even take it offline and be like non internet friends! Sky's the limit really. 

Some tid bits about me to help you get a general idea about me include: I'm very feminine but don't have a problem getting down and dirty with helping work on cars or using power tools. Come on who doesn't love a good belt sander or pack blower? But yet I love to cook, bake, wear dresses etc. I can usually be seen rocking some red lipstick. I love sports, music, sailing and learning in general. 

I hope that you have an amazing week and I hope to find an amazing pal! 

If you could please put your favorite movie in the subject line that would be fantastic! I'd love to know a little about you, your interests and age. If you feel like including a picture that would be dandy. 

Hope to hear from you soon! All the best.

So here's the thing: I am trying to get out into the world as much as possible. My close friends moved away to different parts of the country, and the ones in the area have been so busy with their own lives. I too have been kept busy with work and school, but things are beginning to settle, and I have a feeling that it would be nice to meet new people. Who does not like making new friends?

I am pretty open-minded, love movies, and I am getting back into reading regularly. I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree, where I'm an economics/philosophy/political science major. Running is something I am re-learning to do (I was previously an avid runner), and I am training for a couple 5Ks. I savor the experience of food, especially Thai, where I cannot resist a good plate of pad see ew or pad kee mao. I'm learning to cook and I like comic books, so I have a few geeky moments.

I enjoy witty banter, have hobbies, and genuinely ask questions, so conversation will never be short.

Hi there. 

I'm posting on behalf of a friend. So here goes. 

His name is Joe and is located at Monroe correctional complex. He's in for some stupid mistakes due to some bad choices with drugs and is now paying the price for it. He's pretty awesome though, one of the most loyal, caring, artistic, hilarious guys I know. He has a way of making a person laugh when needed and when no one else can. He's the one you can talk to about anything. He's athletic and works hard to keep himself in shape. He knows he has made bad choices and knows it has gotten him where he is. He is making the necessary changes and doing well. 

Joe is looking for someone who has their head in their shoulders, someone who knows that people deserve a second chance and that everyone makes mistakes. He's not looking for judgement. He's looking for someone to write and maybe talk to, and maybe in the future come up and see him. 

I have a few pictures from when he was on the streets. I will have updated pictures in a few days. 

If your interested of have questions and want his address please feel free to reply to this email. I'd be happy to help.

I'm really feeling great and energetic and need a gal who is pretty close to hwp or a few lbs extra carries it well, on the trail ; ) that is, or perhaps open to some helpful guidance on the go, on how to get a bit retuned and feel great as I do. I hiked some the past few beautiful days, alone. About me a bit, I do have true blue eyes, short sandy blond hair and nearly clean shaven. I enjoy the outdoors and need an energetic friend to go on a walk with or other outdoor(this weekend is awesome) or other activities. Tell or share with me what you look like and why I mite be interested in you!

I am a professional photographer, with high-end equipment, skills, and experience! I am seeking females that would like to model, in a boudoir setting. No sex! Just a collaboration. Ideally, I would love to find an older, mode mature model. I have nothing against the 20-something models! I just, have done that, several times! I am hoping, you are 40-60 Years old!
Perhaps, for your Husband, FiancĂŠ, partner, boyfriend? If interested put ""Model"" in the subject line, to weed out bots.

Hi thanks for stopping by.
Sometimes it gets kind of boring and you need someone new to kick it with, to change things up right?
Well, thats where I am. 
The summer is nigh and I'd like to be out in it. Day hikes, dog parks (I've got a little guy), stuff like that and at night maybe beers and movies or something. 
Ok about me
I'm a 44yo married white male.
Yep, married. It's strained and unusual but it is what it is for now and I like hanging out with women.
Very tall, slim and cute with reddish hair and a goatee to match. 
What about you? 
Please be able to do long walks and maybe day hikes and above all be fun, funny, irreverent, cute, eager to hang out. 
Here's a pic of my little guy.

Professional male coming to Seattle on Friday 4/22 for a work trip, but I'm coming early to walk around the city and explore. I'd love a travel companion for the weekend. I like to walk and explore, regardless of the weather. We can grab a craft beer in a pub for lunch, see the sights (maybe take a ferry across the sound to explore outside of the city) and then have a cocktail before a good dinner with e nice red wine. I like to watch people (serious amateur photographer), i like to see the places tourists don't see and I like to learn about the history of a place. Throughout the day, I will tell you absolutely everything about my life and hope you will do the same. There is nothing that helps people become instantly intimate than the anonymity of not knowing each other and knowing that we will soon part ways; it gives you freedom to say anything. I tend to click best with women in their 30's who have a liberal arts type of education or something in the social sciences area, though scientists and engineers are also fascinating, as is a barista who gets to watch people all day. Just be interesting and not bitter. Who has time for that. For our little adventure, I will pay for everything, including Uber to get you to and from home.

A little more about me: I'm a white male, professional with a grad degree. I am a consultant with a unique niche, which we can talk about later. I travel a fair bit. I'm in my late 40's, 6'2"" and tend toward the beefy side. I'm married and have kids. Again, there's a story there (isn't there always?!?) but my kids are my main focus, which is why I'm still married. It's a mutual agreement. People tell me that I'm kind and amusing and that I listen well, though I can talk too much. I was in the navy as an officer and that helped me to see the world (yes, the cliche is true). I've been to Europe, Central America, the Mideast and SE Asia. The world gets more amazing the more you see of it...

So,. what do you think? Interested? If so, shoot me an email with a photo and ask me anything. I'll return a note to you with a few photos of me.

We dnt judge or care what ur race and sexual preference is. We are just looking to meet or even txt and email back in forth for friends only. We do like to go on road trips when I'm not wrking lol. Or like a mini vacation. My partner is a stay at home kinda of person bc of her health issues, meaning she isn't wrking. You can ask anything and I'll answere. Well I'm just giving this a shot.

Hey there, Im really finicky with people in general, I literally talk to two people in person in my life, my gf and best friend. I keep trying to make a second friend but its really hard for me. I hate most people, I dont get along with them nor care for more friends really, but its hard feeling so shut off from the world sometimes. I also seem to attract a lot of sociopathic people, And im extremly sick of them, so if youve been called one, please dont bother me. Ive tried having compassion for them because thats considered a disorder, but im done doing that and feeling bad for people who get off on fucking other peoples lives over, my empathy is far better used on people who arent the REASON the world is so fucked up I dont even leave my house unless I have to. 

Anyways, I tend to rant about the shit world a lot, I live with chronic illness- I have a connective tissue disorder so some days are harder to get around then others, but I can do cool tricks like the bendy pics in this post ha. Also have schizoaffective disorder which makes me a bit extra paranoid of people and reclusive. Im an artist.. I feel like Im writing an ad for a dog with issues or somehting ha. I dont know how to communicate with people on the ""socially acceptable level"" The whole hi how are you?- oh Fine you? - I hate idle chatter and how we all just go through these shit fucking motions in life, never really tapping into eachother on a human being level. Im not a robot, and I feel like nearly every person I talk to in public are just empty shells on autopilot, its creepy and reminds me why I almost never bother to seek any other people in my life out. 
Anywhat, preferably Id like someone around my age- though I usually get along with way older people a ton better, I think id be more nervous to met someone whos like 70 online ha. In person I see to get along with them better then most shit nose young people. I may be eccentric and look like that type of person, but Ive been told by even my own family that Im like an old man about things. Ha and then I even sometimes use a walker hahaha, Im not your average person lets just say.

Intelligent, educated, professional, WM with a truly wicked sense of humor and a flair for the erotic, seeks an e-buddy to build synergy and to resonate with.

I get bored as hell at work because I do the same thing over and over. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me out of the loony bin is chatting it up...texting, email, IM, talking on the phone...Hell it could be smoke signals (no, not THAT kind of smoke), carrier pigeons, or bongo drums and I'd still enjoy it.

What I'm looking for is to make a connection...To have that spark happen when intelligent conversation and flirting are mixed together with the rush of meeting somebody new. BOOM! Explosive?...Oh hell yes! I love it!

So then what happens, you ask. Well, I'm separated and I'm definitely not looking to change anybody's situation while I figure out mine. I'm really not expecting that we hook up, date, or even meet for an ice cream sundae at a church social (I've never done it in a church, lol...Have you?). At the end of the day, I'm just hoping to find a gal pal who both enjoys some male attention and giving a guy that same attention. Anything beyond that...let's cross that bridge if we ever get to it.

So let's talk about you: A woman (sorry guys, nothing personal, I just don't swing that way), 40-60 (the age is just a suggestion because we're likely to have more in common...but if you're under 40 or over 60 and you think you're up for the challenge, then by all means). Race, looks, religion, occupation, politics, astrological sign, blood type, favorite football team, etc etc are unimportant. Marital status...that's an interesting one. I prefer you to be married or divorced...But, as with the age, if you think you're up for it, then by all means.

Turn On's:
A.) A woman who has a sense of humor as warped and irreverent as mine (You can laugh at almost anything).

B.) A woman who doesn't need me to carry the conversation all the time (aka isn't afraid to speak her mind).

C.) A woman with something going on upstairs (aka you know what synergy and resonance mean...or at least you're motivated enough to crack the dictionary).

D.) You're a fan of flirting and being flirted with. If you DON'T, let's not waste each others time.

Turn Off's:
A:) If you're somebody who thinks that bored people are boring, then carry your ass, sister. You're probably a princess and I don't need the headache.

B.) Likewise if you're going to be offended by my self confidence and think it's arrogance or conceit. If that's offensive or threatening, keep moving. There's plenty of gals who like self confidence in a man.

C.) Ditto on preaching about morality. If I want a lecture, I'll go to the aforementioned church and try that ice cream sundae.

D.) Nit Pickers. See A, Princess types for details. I'm not here to try and fix what's wrong with anybody and I sure don't need somebody doing it to me.

The rest of you gals, crack that dictionary, look up synergy, and drop me a line ;)

I am 63 years old, divorced in Dec. 2013. While I have a number of friends that I go to movies, dancing, plays and even the opera with, I am having a hard time getting my friends to do other activities due to work schedules, their lack of funds or their lack of interest. Those activities include day trips to places like LaConnor, Leavenworth or some of the upcoming summer fairs, concerts at Chateau Ste Michelle, museums, National Geographic presentations at Benaroya and more. So I am looking to expand my circle of friends with people who enjoy such activities.

I am originally from NY, though I've been in the Seattle area for 28 years. I am small business owner of an event decorating service for the passed 16 years. I am agnostic, and do not believe in organized religion. I have a 29 year old son and two Shih Tzu fur babies. I live in Lynnwood, but lived in Seattle for many years, in the Matthews Beach/Wedgwood neighborhoods. I don't have a problem traveling, it's only 20 to 30 minutes, and I love going to Seattle and do a lot of activities downtown. 

I enjoy good science fiction, action movies and movies based on true stories (not really fond of most chick flicks, though I am willing to go if that is a friend's choice). I enjoy ""real"" science too (favorite subjects include ancient Egypt, dinosaurs, the Universe); also history, art, jazz, comedy shows. I love seafood and ethnic restaurants. I'm a documentary addict. I love Neil DeGrass Tyson (and was a huge fan of Carl Segan). Most of the books I read are non-fiction, as I enjoy learning. I'm not athletic, though I don't mind watching important sports games, or going to stadium games. I enjoy old car shows and old car museums. When I retire, I'd love to travel in an RV for a while, as I love West/Southwest National Parks, especially Yellowstone and Bryce. I used to think I'd be doing that with my husband, but now will have to find friends who want to do the same, or do it myself (I am already making plans to tow a teardrop trailer behind my Mustang, just in case). I also want to travel to Italy, and want to go on a tour in Egypt with Dr. Zahi Hawass. I have a time share in Maui and would love someone to go there with me sometime.

I prefer female friends to be between 45 and 70. I can't stand smoke of any kind (cigarette, cigar, pipe or pot smoke), don't do drugs. I am NOT 420 friendly. Please tell me something about yourself. Let's get some communication going.

Ok.... this sucks. Working and having nobody to talk to and having way too much time on my hands.... Come on quittin time! I think that stupid clock on the wall that every has to stare at is possessed and is purposely going as slow as it can go making my work day suck. The sun is out and I am ready to punch out!

So a little about me I am in my early 30's, white, athletic, work out alot, love the out doors and enjoying what nature has to offer. I am also attached with one kid. She doesnt like to text and told me to find some one else to text so...... here I am. Good ol Craigslist. lol but Im Not sure any body even looks here any more for a social environment but hey, I'll give it a shot anyways. :-) Im not sure this is gonna work and Im sure my inbox will stay empty but why not amuse myself lol I am new to the Olympia area and have been here for about 2 years and am looking to start expanding my social circle and meet new people out side of the gym and work who are local and are also looking to make new friends. Dont really have too many friends right now around Olympia and with my work schedule and my kid its hard to find the time to go out and socialize and meet new people. :-/

So what am I looking for?? Hhmmm..... just any body who wants to talk who is local. Kinda looking for a side kick. Some one to hang out with and do things with. Hanging out with the guys is fun but some times you just wanna change it up. Looks dont matter. I think the out side is just a disguise anyways. Its not what you look like, its who you are so Dont let the fact that I work out detour you because I am not shallow. I'll be friends with any one as long as you can hold a conversation with more than one letter. :-/

So yeah... if you wanna chat and see if we click hit me up! I have nothing but time. We can talk about any thing. :-) Im not looking for a pen pal. I dont wanna email my summer away. Summer is almost here and I wanna be enjoying the sun and having fun!

Hey,

I know this sounds a little pathetic, but I'm a romantic.

About a year ago, went through a really bad breakup. Well, she moved out while I was out of town for work, so not really a break up. Actually, I've been very happy, but today something happened that hit me really hard. I would love to talk to someone, but being a strong person, and seen by the people in my life as a dominant figure who takes care of everyone else, I almost feel like I don't have anyone to talk to.

I know this probable won't go anywhere. Still, I'm just very sad and looking for someone to listen.

It's hard making friends at this age, especially if your not in school or at a regular job. I am a freelance photographer and currently working from home. Very artsy. Super laid back.

I have a boyfriend who I've been with for almost 4 years and we could really use other ""couple friends"" so if you are the same thats a plus. Love being silly and sarcastic. Love traveling and adventures. arts and crafts, movies, going out to eat, walking around green lake, I'm a fashion photographer (but never been super into fashion but its growing on me...) Love trips to goodwill, Obsessed with sugar gliders and own 2. Not afraid of laughing at myself. 

fav tv shows: the walking dead, Outlander, Gilmore girls, New Girl, love DIY network show, I like cheesy shows like ""married at first sight"", Love a lot of comedy but blanking on which ones haha. 

fav movie: never been kissed and cry baby 

boyfriend is an ex-skater boy, likes playing GTA on xbox, and watching scary movies, playing football for fun with some coworkers, soon to start a 2 year mechanics program, likes to pretend he can rap and sometimes tries to make music, he's from the east coast, likes making jokes and a super genuinely nice guy.

******* NOT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING SEXUAL *********
Seriously, what the hell. 

Anyway, Hi Ladies!

I'm almost 27 years old, getting married in September to my fiance of almost 7 years, and we are expecting our first baby in October. Needless to say, it's a huge year for me and while I'm overwhelmed, I'm extremely happy and excited and am hoping to find a mom or two to commiserate and share life with. :)

I would be so happy to find a few friends to exercise with (at the Y, go for walks, take classes, etc.), have coffee or wine with (in October, anyway..damn!), swim with, take lessons with, craft with (I'm all about trying to save money and DIY), and just be myself with. I like to joke around, cuss, make light of stressful situations, and stay as positive about life as possible while not taking myself too seriously. 

I get along with just about everybody I meet because of my friendly, outgoing, and compassionate personality, but I definitely have a line that I draw when it comes to certain people. I am all for cussing and ranting and raving and getting your emotions out, but if you are rude and like to make fun of or put others down, have a lot of drama but don't want to try and fix it or make your life better, overly dramatic about everything, ungrateful, pessimistic, fake, full of yourself, or super quiet, we may not get along. At all. I just want to meet some genuinely nice, funny, cool people. Can't be that hard!

If I sound like someone you could tolerate, I would love to hear from you! Tell me about yourself and your family, what you're wanting to get out and do this summer, your likes/dislikes, etc.

Thanks for taking the time to read and I look forward to meeting some awesome people! :)

But ALL of you, will have the privilege , no, the Honor! Of emailing me. 
I know you're probably thinking to yourself, this guy is ""full of it""! But rest assured, I am not! 
I would bet my life that if I were the last man on the face the earth, I would totally get A girl.... You can take that to the bank!!
I'm sure there are a few of you who are still unsure. So here's another example. 
One night, I was at a red light and It was taking too long so I pulled out my phone. And out of nowhere! I heard a horn honking, so I looked through the rear view mirror and I saw it was a lovely young lady who was honking. Obviously, she was trying to get my attention. Or as the urban youths would say, 
""Trynna holla at me"" 
BUT! The light was green so I couldn't grace her with my presence. 
That darn light!!

Anyways, a little about myself..
I am 28 years old.
I stand 6'0 (without heels)

It's not common that I have to go buy myself a new suit, but I have an interview next week and I can no longer fit into one of my suits, and the other just doesn't fit right in the shoulders.

I am not a good shopper for myself and typically when I bring a friend to help me, they are usually more into shopping for themselves than supporting me (because I look fine in whatever, right? Wrong).

If you are good at helping me shop and can find or work a deal, have apparel skills, would make an alteration quickly for a little $, and overall know how to turn my stressful venture into something fun (at least for you, because you could at least make fun of me and I could take it like a sport), then PLEASE hit me up! 

I want to go today, after 6pm. Let's meet somewhere in Bellevue. I would be happy to buy you dinner or lunch for your troubles.

Hello Seattlites!

I'm fairly new to Seattle and I'm still looking to make new friends that I can go out with. I'm a very independent person and I often go out on my own, but it would be nice to meet somebody new.

I have a varying array of interest and particularly enjoy conversations. I'm from Ca, enjoy studying, sociologist, music festivals, dancing, reading, current events, politics, love to travel and explore.

If you are interested, please feel free to send me a message. I'm very open minded about people I talk to and looking forward to hearing from you.

Looking for someone who is interested in the weird but hilarious world of Noel Fielding! I've heard it pretty surreal and funny. Noel has been on IT crowd as Richmond, Garth M. Darkplace, and the Buzzcocks. He is most popular because of The Mighty Boosh. The show has been described as a drug trip. At one point Noel gets in a fight with a triangle named Donald because he's been sleeping with his wife. So of for some reason you enjoy a strange humor such as this let me know! My friend bailed because she's extremely sick. 

I'm just looking for someone to hang out with and maybe chat in line with. L The ticket is free to you and the seating is general admission at the Neptune.

I'm a fairly normal 28 year old guy who enjoys checking out new and interesting things. I'm in shape and good looking. Enjoy hiking, climbing, cooking, traveling, checking out the latest bars and restaurants. That's all for now.

Hope to hear from you!

Hi,
We are a monogamous couple (we are in our late twenties, but don't look it.) that are looking for new friends. We moved to WA 8 months ago and are looking for fun times! 

About us: We don't do any drugs (including 420) We drink on occasion and like to go out. Dancing, comedy clubs, hiking, working out -we are working on getting into shape. We love the alternative lifestyle Goth, metal head, piercings etc ...but can be friends with anyone as long as we have things in common and can have a great time. We love animals and have a German Shepherd. Doggie play dates are welcomed! 

We do not have kids and never will. Please don't be older than 35, if you have kids don't reply. We are looking for fun couples (married or not that part doesn't matter.) Or if you're single and are cool with hanging out with a couple than that's fine too. We are only looking for friends nothing more, NO sexual anything!

We can talk and get to know each other! 

Thanks

I am looking to see if there is anyone out there who might want to join me? I don't mind going alone, but it would be fun to have a buddy. I have never actually paddle boarded before, so that part is new for me. It would be a plus if you've actually done it before. :)

Additionally, I would also like to take my little dog on the occasional hike, so maybe if we become fast friends we can do some hiking as well! Essentially, I am just looking for some outdoor pals. 

A little about me:
I'm 34 and I moved to Seattle last fall for work. I am guaranteed to be here until October, at which point I may move again; it really depends on work. I work in the healthcare field and I have a special interest in trans healthcare (please no homophobes).

About me: I will be meeting my boyfriend in the area so this is strictly platonic. He didn't want to go and the friend that was supposed to go with me had her babysitter bail. So...I am 5 feet tall, 195 pounds. Red hair, blue eyes, white. I'm 1/8 Chinese and never took the opportunity to learn about that heritage before my grandma passed so I guess I'm trying to make up for it. 

You: Be between 28-50 years old. Unless you're a really cool grandpa or grandma that has stories to tell about your heritage! That would be sweet!! Ok...also please have a sense of humor. Be ok with hanging out with a fat chick for awhile. Be interesting? Don't be a creep. :)

I'm incredibly fun and I love people so I don' think you'll have a terrible time ;)

If interested, Google Shen Yun and do the following:

1. Reply with Shen Yun in the subject of the email
2. Send a pic (yes, you can sometimes tell creepers from pics)
3. Tell me why you want to see Shen Yun
4. Tell me 3 random things about yourself.

I'm 1/8 Chinese and never took the opportunity to learn about that heritage before my grandma passed so I guess I'm trying to make up for it. 

You: Be between 28-50 years old. Unless you're a really cool grandpa or grandma that has stories to tell about your heritage! That would be sweet!! Ok...also please have a sense of humor. Be ok with hanging out with a fat chick for awhile. Be interesting? Don't be a creep. :)

I'm incredibly fun and I love people so I don' think you'll have a terrible time ;)

If interested, Google Shen Yun and do the following:

1. Reply with Shen Yun in the subject of the email
2. Send a pic (yes, you can sometimes tell creepers from pics)
3. Tell me why you want to see Shen Yun
4. Tell me 3 random things about yourself. 

If I find you interesting, I'll reply back with my pic so you can try to see if I'm a total creep or not. Lol. Thanks for looking...

Hi!

I've noticed quite a few adds on Craigslist seem to be scams. Hopefully, there's some real people here!

I'm a real person, seeking a new intelligent friend, mostly for phone conversations. I'm free to talk at night often. That's not really me in the picture, that's a baby anteater. :)

My interests include animals, jokes, music, philosophy, health & nutrition, stock trading, psychology, math, science, business ideas, people, spiritual ideas, lots of other things. I work as an engineer, and a volunteer doing various things including tutoring & life coaching.

Looking forward to talking with you!

Hi there, now that spring is here and summer is quickly approaching I'm realizing that I am running out of people to hangout with. Due to their marriages, having kids, or careers most of my friends are becoming less and less free, which has left me with a hunk of free time and very few people to spend it with. 
I'm looking for someone who wants to hangout as friends. Whether that be texting/chatting or doing things together in person. 

I'm into sports, hiking, movies, eating out, fishing, horse races, board games, video games, and other things. If you have similar interests please feel free to contact me at utmastuh on g/m/a/i/l

I'm chill, laid back, non-creepy (just thought I'd throw that in) looking for other like-minded guys around my own age (23 up to 40s, really depends, some are young at heart). 

I am very well-traveled and have been to probably 44 states. I'm college educated and work full-time. Stable and like to laugh. I don't get easily offended. Enjoy raunchy jokes, burping, farting, overall guy things, yet I can clean up nice if I'm going out on the town. I really can get along with anyone. 

Note: if all you're looking for is to text and email and never meet ""in real life"" then don't bother wasting my time. Yes we all get busy and need to work around schedules but I'm not looking for a cyber friendship.

Into: music (hip-hop R&B, techno, alt. rock, Michael Buble/top 20 modern stuff/80s 90s music/some country and many others!)books (got a kindle fire and it's freaking awesome to take books with me (Harry Potter/Dean Koontz/Stephen King/Bourne Identity series/Lord of the Ring series and man others!)bars/clubscoffeeroad tripsmotorcycles (just got my endorsement with another bromance bud)hot girls & guys massage animals (I have a small Schnauzer)honesty masculine (it's cool if you're gay just don't be a queen)cars/bikes/anything fast, like import carscampinggoing to the lake cooking (gourmet foods)technology (cell phones, E readers, computers, etc)finance and investments/budgetsPlus if you:already have a passport (Canada!)have an animalalready know how to ride a motorcycle/own onemasculinenon-smokerare emotionally and financially stable (I pay my own way when we go out, unless otherwise discussed)smart/educated (but I'm no snob)good looking good wing-mainly looking for an overall good buddy to explore life withclean/good hygeine (you'd think this would be a given) your own method of transportation or at least a transit card. I'm pretty sarcastic and like to socialize. 

Love to text when I'm out of town for work (or talk on the phone normally. what's with those people who ONLY text, and act like they're afraid to call someone?) Looking for good buddies for above-all friendship/bonding (just like the title states). Shoot me a line, describe yourself, send a pix (I will return the favor), and your interests/hobbies. If you're married and discrete, the secret is between us (believe me I know the deal). Into all types of guys, white/latino/black, just as long as you're not a douche :0) Be local or some where in my ballpark of location (the entire south sound, or Seattle itself, even). 

Let's get to know each other. Type ""bromance"" into subject headline of email so I know you're not those annoying ads........thanks guys! Happy Craigslisting! If you're serious and have read this ad fully, please include a face picture, and at least a paragraph about yourself and what you like to do for fun. No one line responses and people with no face pictures. I will respond with one, too. I'm tired of getting 3 word answers. Thanks

Lake Stevens, Snohomish, Marysville ladies....

I'm lonely! All my close friends live out of state and trying to make new friends in this area seems to be a difficult thing. Seems everyone already has a circle of friends, husbands & boyfriends and making time for someone new isn't in their plans. I tried a CL ad before but nothing seemed to really gel.

I am a straight woman that enjoys hiking/backpacking, camping, shooting ranges, auctions, shoes oh dear gawd I love SHOES and just hanging out and watching movies. I'm not religious and can't stand religious dogma, but I am spiritual. I believe in energy and reincarnation. I have a naughty sense of humor so I am NOT PC. I've been happily divorced for 15 years and have done it ALL on my own since then I was a single mom that raised her son by herself so I'm strong but he's now in the Navy. 

I'm finding myself lonely for female friends to hang out with. I'm 47 but I'm still young at heart. I don't smoke and can't be around it, it gives me migraines. I don't do drugs and drink socially. I'm a pretty normal, got-it-together woman just looking for friends and finally figured out they aren't going to knock on my door to ask if I want to come out and play :)

If you are maybe in a similar place and would like to meet and see if we could make a friendship grow I'd love to hear from you. The only things I really am not interested in are golf and anything IN the ocean. Shopping? Let's go! Crafts? Sure, just don't laugh when my paper lion looks like a frog. Dancing at a local club? Watch these 90's moves go, baby! Let's walk the Centennial Trail, I've got good sneakers :) Karaoke? Totally! I have 2 kayaks so let's paddle Lake Stevens in the evening and grab a bite after.

All I ask is that you be yourself and looking for a strictly platonic friendship.

I am new to Seattle, having moved here after my marriage went bad. I came here for a new job, which is going well, and provided me with the challenge I needed to pull myself out of the funk I was in. Fast forward 1 year, divorce now final, and I think it is time I found some friends in the area to do things with. I am planning to go out this afternoon for a beer or two, and I would love some company. I never thought I would be starting over at 50, but I am excited about it. 

I am heading to Georgetown, as it is pretty close to where I live, and seems to have the kind of establishments I like to go to. I am not a big drinker, and I don't go out very often. Mostly I have been focusing on my work, and starting over, so I have not had a lot of extra money for such things.

I tend to be a pretty gregarious type, for the most part. I find it fairly easy to make friends wherever I go. Most likely this is a product of my upbringing in an environment that was constantly changing. My step father changed jobs very frequently, so we moved around a lot. I went to around 20 different schools in my childhood. 

I have a very wide variety of interests, and I like a good conversation. I have a pretty good vocabulary, and I am fairly worldly, as well, so I can talk about anything you like. 

If you feel like making a new friend, send me a note, and we can take it from there.

Hi,
I guess I should tell you right off what I'm looking for. I've never done this so please excuse my awkwardness. I need a new friend(s). Yes, I'm looking for someone I can be intimate with. I'm not talking about just getting laid, it's highly likely that won't even happen, at least not until sometime later. I do however, need someone who would like or even need physical intimacy right away. Why, you ask? Well here's my sob story. About a month ago me and my girlfriend of about one year got into a terrible fight and she decided to end our relationship. Without being unnecessarily dramatic, I am completely heart broken. I'm not looking for a new relationship or someone to replace her. I'm also not doing this for some sort of revenge, she's already with someone new and I'm confident she wouldn't give a shit anyway. I am however terribly lonely and would really like to have someone to hold on to, and even fall asleep with on a regular basis. I am in my 40s, I am employed full time, own my car, and my home so I'm not some loser in a basement somewhere. I am not looking for any type in particular other than please be 50 or under, otherwise any age or race is fine. I will be happy to send you a picture if you respond to this with interest and one of yourself. And you're not a bot or a scammer! Please put something in your response that indicates you are local, real, and sincere.

I've never posted anything like this but I live a busy life and would like to make some connections with new friends. I am a mom of 3 and recently going back to college for a career change. Soon to be finishing up with my 2nd degree and will be working on my 3rd. The weather is starting to get nice and I would like to get outdoors more. I have recently started a fitness journey and it would be nice to find someone to do some hikes with. 

A little about me...I love photography, soccer (watching, although watching me play would probably drum up a few laughs), hiking, going to movies, beaches, I drink occasionally and like to dance. I've lived here my whole life and haven't ventured enough into the outdoors and I'm looking to change that. 

I'm not looking for anything beyond a friendship so looks and size don't matter and I hope the feeling is mutual there. As I stated above I started my fitness journey at the beginning of this year and I have enjoyed the process of changing my life. If any of this interests you, I hope to hear from you. A pic from you and will get one from me. I do have kik so if you have one and want to chat that way send your kik info in your reply :) Put your city in the subject line so I know you're real :)

One request: Please don't flag:)

So, I have posted couple of times on CL offering a free massage.

I used to do this quite a bit earlier in another city (moved here 4 yrs ago) and I would easily find folks to trade massages with. If nothing, it'd be at least a one way massage. 

It was so strange - for both my ads, I got like one response...lol. 

Thought - I was doing something wrong so thought of seeking feedback. What would be a concern seeking a platonic massage through CL? 

I mean, Massages are fairly expensive so a free one should be interesting, right? As for safety, I first offer to meet in public, talk on phone and even keep the first massage as simple as possible - for example just arms or just neck. No full body or anything that'd make you uncomfortable with a stranger. I can also offer couple of references from my friends in NYC who I have done this with. Not once have I crossed the decency line. I'm a gentleman with a normal life, job, education etc. High hygiene and to those it matters, I look decent too.

Why I do it - its fun really. Meeting someone new and the possibility of finding a massage trading partner is awesome. I enjoy the touch - giving or receiving but have zero expectations beyond that. Relaxation and the chat and the idea of meeting someone new is just awesome!

Overall, its full transparency so wanted to know what could I still be missing in my offer?

Any and every feedback is welcome - feel free to just curse me too:) Even that is a feedback!

The other categories I've posted in have brought an overwhelming response but not of the serious nature that I had hoped for. I am seriously missing the intimacy and romance that tends to disappear from long term relationships. I'm looking to find a similarly situated man to converse with. Maybe we will meet, maybe not. The attraction for me has little to do with still life, ie. your photo, but with a connection based on similarities in our lives. You are between the age of 50 an 65 and gainfully employed or perhaps retired. It isn't all about sex but about finding or creating a special friendship. Anyone out there with the same needs?

You should be in good shape, confident, experienced, and have your life put together. You should be the kind of guy who can hit on women without drinking. I don't mind if you drink, but I won't be drinking.

Hey hey - 

Hope all is well for you guys out there! I'm a 27 year old gay gamer looking for other fellow gamers. I mainly play Action/RPG/Fighter/FPS video games on consoles like PS4 or 3DS/WiiU. However, I have had quite an interest in board games recently. I've only played a handful of board games but would not be opposed to meeting others who are interested video/board games.

I've lived here for over a year and would like to expand my circle of friends. I'm a 5'8"" latino with a stocky build. I'd say. I can be very introverted at first but once I feel pretty comfortable, my true colors show. I absolutely love to laugh and make other laugh all the time :D 
I regularly 420 with edibles or flower/dabs, so if you're cool with that -- awesome!

I'm hoping to find friends who like to play multiplayer games like Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Cal Of Duty, ect. I'd like a reason to get out of the house and chill/play video games.

Although this ad may be target toward other gaming buddies, I do not want to restrict it to just gaming. I also enjoy checking out Seattle, eating at new places, cooking for others, networking, building, shopping, walking around and just having all around fun.

I am also looking to find a friend I can be sexually open with. I don't have many friends that I openly talk to about sex. I would very much enjoy having a mate who would like to occasionally jerk off and cuddle. 

If this sounds like something you're looking for, drop me a line.

I am an 8 yr veteran currently fresh out of the Army. I have returned to Washington because I miss it so much from the 7 years I spent stationed out here. I am currently taking up classes at Green River CC and hope to transfer to UW Tacoma after my first two years.

I love the outdoors and hiking and the beach. I am actually returning from being stationed in Hawaii so I'm definitely going to miss those beaches. All and all show me some kind of adventure and you'll catch my attention.

I am also a bit of a hybrid between geek and nerd. I'm a huge Whovian and Browncoat as well. I love comics and collecting things. Im big into video games and computers and the likes. If you know anything bout comics i could sit and talk to you all day. Im also that guy who will go to comic con all dressed up as my favorite person.

I like to draw, love to read. Favorite Authors are Stephen King, Dean Koontz, and Piers Anthony. Favorite series is Odd Thomas, and the Incarnations of Immortality.

I absolutely love Music. I like to think i have a decent voice and will challenge you to Karaoke any day. I also play a little piano and the sax though its been awhile since I've touched either. Music tastes, well i listen to pretty much everything except rap.

Also i will say that i went through a divorce not soo long ago. Im not looking to develop anything terribly fast as a result however I do miss having that friend there to share everything with or talk about everything to.

I better not say too much dont want to give it all away. Then what will we have to talk about?

pictures please or i will not respond im sure you know the deal. Also put the day of the week in te title no spam please :D

Hi, thanks for reading my ad. E mail me if you'd like a guys point of view on whats going on in your relationship , if you would like to know what a guy you know is thinking or if you'd just like to know why guys do what they do. We aren't that complicated but I guess sometimes women try to figure men out using their logic when we (men) think in an entirely different way. I would love to help you out and at least give you some ideas on what your guy is thinking. This is just me giving you my thoughts and advice nothing more. I don't even live in your town and i wont be bugging you to meet or a date or anything like that. Take care

This meeting of traitors anonymous is called to order.

Hello, my name is Giaus and I am an enemy of the United Kingdom. I wasn't naturally born an enemy of the United Kingdom, I was made one by my family, my education, the circumstances of the stars in the sky at the hour of my birth. I still remember clearly my early upbringing in the way of revolution. I was only about five when my mother first told me of my destiny. We were riding in a car, travelling from Seattle to Olympia. 

""This is the United States"" she said solemnly, with all her love. ""This is an independent country."" It sounded so serene. ""Independent country"", I loved the sound of it. Then she went on ""We're independent of Britain."" Oh, it was a beautiful summer's day. By the time out trip to the State Capitol was over, I was thoroughly entranced by the majesty of the republican law, the due process, the jurisprudence. It was so perfect and all inspiring that by the time she got me home I had decided to totally destroy Britain, whatever the bleep that was, for denying it's right to exist way back in the 1700s.

I look back on my life, and I look around this meeting, at all the other anonymous e-people. Do I really want to be here? Do I regret being an enemy of the United Kingdom? Perhaps there are times. But then I think about the British themselves. After all, they are all indoctrinated, as I was. They are my enemies, sworn to destroy me as a traitor.

I could never be friends with England, that would be impossible. After all the time I've put into being a republican, a citizen. And yet I look back on my life with sadness. All of the conflict, all of the strife. 

I don't know what I hope to find here. Not a conspiracy, I hope, not another crime against my tory neighbors. Maybe there's someone else. Someone whose a true believer, someone who doesn't think we all have to be like Kim Philby and Gerry Adams just to be yanks.

Feel free to join this conversation. What was it like for you when they told you the story? Were they droll, did they give you a lot of gory details, did they care how you felt about being accused of such a heinous crime?

I'm 20 years old and transgender (ftm) already changed my legal name and pronouns. 

I'm not a fan of kids and only want to be friends with people who don't want kids and don't have them unless they're all grown up.

I'm an atheist and a furry, no it's not about sex I'm asexual (not interested in sex or any sexual contact of any kind) and having my fursuit made as I type this. 

My favorite band is blood on the dance floor. However, my music taste is all over the place. Just not a fan of screamo or metal bands. 

I have no pets and am on disability but not in a wheelchair or anything. 

Guinea pigs are my favorite animal and neon green is my favorite color. I'm also vegan. No I don't give a fuck what you eat as long as you don't be rude about the fact that I don't consume innocent animals :)

I'm not okay with smoking of any kind, not even once a week so please move on if you're a smoker and don't plan on quitting soon (it stinks and I'm allergic to smoke).

I'm 420 friendly but don't partake and I prefer that you not smoke it around me because I'm trying to find a job. 

I'm generally more comfortable with people who identify as female or other transgender people, I've had no negative experiences with biological man, ironically all my bad experiences have been with women. 

Not sure what else to put here, I'm autistic and I do not like being touched in anyway. I would like to meet other fans of Blood On The Dance Floor! that are around me, I plan on going to their concert this summer and would like someone to go with. 

It'd be cool to meet other furries too! 

You can find me on Facebook @ dahvie hammons. 

My Facebook is private and I do not post pictures of myself, so please do not ask for them. I would much rather just meet in person and let you see my face that way. I do have piercings and stretched ears. Please no one religious, sexist, homophobic or racist and no Donald Trump supporters. Someone needs to assassinate that asshat.

I won't get into too much here, but I'm looking for a woman who understands what I am going through, or is experiencing the same.

I would be happy to chat with you through emails, and then hopefully meet soon. If I don't get some good company soon I am either going to die by boredom or nagging!

This is not about sex, but meeting a friend who can commiserate with me. However, I would be open to a physical encounter if we hit it off well enough ;-)

Me - I'm tall, good natured, funny (I've been told), decent looking, not fat, and clean.

I like movies, bbq's, exploring new areas, road trips, wine tastings etc. I work full time during the week and have weekends off. I am also trying to lose weight, so if you are interested in working out together or supporting each other in the journey that would be great :) I don't mind if you are married, single or with kids, just want to be able to have some local friends to talk to and do activities with.

I live most of the time on the Bulgarian Danube, in a large, old, creaky house that once belonged to a wine merchant.

My Bulgarian partner is dying and I am desperately lonely being stuck at home looking after him. I need to talk and am finding the isolation tough. When he passes I may come back to live in Seattle if I can afford it.

I'm a young sales professional and mother who enjoys more than the occasional joint. I don't have very many friends but that's mainly because I am so busy, but I will make time for the right person. I would prefer someone whose child is similar in age, mine is 2, who likes to just hang out. I'm really into tv and video games and would love to go out and do more save for the fact that I always go alone and that sucks so much and is so awkward. So let's get the munchies together and take our kids to parks or go window shopping. :)

No men please. I'm seeking strictly female friendships.

So if you clicked on the title, great. You're not easily offended. I don't curse all the time, but I use more than my fair share. I'm almost 34. I've been married to my husband for 13 years and we have two children- 13 y/o son and 9 y/o daughter. I work full-time but need a good girlfriend in my life. Saturdays are boring as shit because my husband works them... when he isn't working, we spend time together camping, riding quads and bbq'ing. So if you're married and have kids, that's great. If you don't have kids, that's great. And if you're single, that's great too but I'm in a faithful relationship and am not looking to go out partying at the clubs and shit. I like all types of music but mostly listen to country, rock and some of today's hits... I like getting my nails done and window shopping... I like crafts, working out, drinking coffee (and the occasional glass of wine or other alcoholic beverage), and would love to explore this beautiful state. Been here for a decade, all my girlfriends happened to be tied to the military and have left... OH and not to be prejudice but I'm not into the 420 crowd, so if that's you, please just move along :) So... if you're around my age and think we might click, write me back!

About me - I have a professional level job and I've published a number of poems online and in print but never really tried to publish a book of poetry. I HAVE written a few book-length works of genre fiction and self-published one. All in all my professional writing career has netted me less than $1000.

What I like - music (prog rock, punk), weird stuff from the internet, the poetry of Frank Stanford, the novels of Raymond Chandler and JRR Tolkein. I recently took a week long trip down to New Orleans just to check it out before it gets swallowed by the Gulf of Mexico.

• Nobody's feet are allowed on the furniture, but your dogs are welcome to sleep on any piece they choose .
• It takes an entirely separate garbage can to handle the poop.
• All kinds of things around the house are in need of repair, but if your dog needs immediate surgery and out comes the checkbook.
• You haven't had your annual check up in years, but the dogs are all medically up to date.
• You're more concerned with the dogs' needs than your own when the budget gets tight.
• You can only remember people by associating them with their dog.
• Your mom calls and asks how the granddogs are.
• Every gift you ever get has something to do with dogs.
• You rip up the carpet and lay tile to make clean up so much easier.
• Your first concern when planning a vacation is whether or not the hotel will take pets.
• You politely bow out of an important social engagement so you can attend to your dogs.
• The number one priority when buying a new house is the size and landscape of the backyard.
• The cost of boarding your furkids equals that of your entire vacation.
• Your desk proudly displays your canine family.
• All dates must pass your dog's inspection.
• The first question you ask when on a date is: ""So, do you like dogs?""
• You break down and buy another pillow so you can have one to sleep on.
• More than half your grocery money goes to dog food and treats.
• You send out especially-made holiday cards that feature you and the dogs.
• Your spouse issues the ultimatum: ""It's them or me!"" and you have no problem pointing out the suitcase.
• Your dogs eat only the most nutritionally sound food, while your favorite meal is mac'n cheese.
• You've just spent $60 on groceries and realize none of it is for yourself.
• Your ""Welcome"" sign has a dog on it.
• You have a kiddy wading pool in the yard, but no small children.
• You have baby gates permanently installed at strategic places around the house, but no babies.
• Poop has become a source of conversation for you and your significant other.
• Your dog sleeps with you.
• You like people who like your dog. You despise people who don't.
• You talk about your dog the way other people talk about their kid.
• You put an extra blanket on the bed so your dog is more comfortable.

Update: I've posted before, but only to have people flake out. I have no idea why it's so hard to find someone willing to give as well as get a massage. You can go second so you get the most time and a better experience if you like. It's a rainy, grey day. Let's try and have a little relaxation. Nothing more is expected.

Hello,

I'll keep this short and sweet. I doubt it will go anywhere anyway.

I am single, fit and have a nice home in Silverdale. I have a massage table and give an amazing rub! I work out regularly and also like to stay very active. 

Not only do I love to give massage, once in a while I would love to get one! I hate paying for them as I think sometimes the best are between friends who aren't watching the clock and who will listen when I give them direction on what feels good. Honestly I have had problems with both when paying.

So, we can be friends who enjoy each others company and conversation, or we can just be two people who need a nice, no pressure massage. 

Not to sound like a jerk, but I do want a massage. Not to rub on you for over an hour, hop on the table and after 5 minutes of light passes of the hands, have you say you're tired. Nor do I want to get up and have you grab my privates and think that's all I'm there for.

Don't worry if you're inexperienced or don't think you have the hand strength. I can teach you what to do and how to use your weight to do the work without hardly any stress to you at all. How do you think professionals do this all day every day?

If you are interested in this, I would love to hear from you. We can chat a bit, meet somewhere public and safe for us both and see how we click. Honestly, I would love a massage today if you're up for it!

Thanks for reading and take care,

I am 20 years old, fairly attractive college student. I have been single for over 2 years and miss taking care of a woman. Honestly, I miss giving massages too...I would love to find someone who would be willing to let me practice my massages on them. I especially enjoy giving foot massages. Obviously this will also include talking and if it leads to more, like a relationship, I am open to that. Open to any age, ethnicity, or body type. NO GUYS! Also, you need to host, but I will travel to you. If you are interested, please shoot me an email about yourself and what you are looking for. Please include a pic for mine and change the subject line to your favorite hobby. Yes I am real, Mariners home opener was yesterday. Hope to hear from you soon :)

I am 47 y/o not married and never been.
I have no children either. If you do, that's fine.

I do not drink or smoke. It's ok is you are lightly though. Things like that get to me, if it's allot.
Looking for someone who is kind and understanding and nonjudgmental.we all have stories to tell, some very personal and or private.

My nights are not the type that are in ""THE SCENE"". I am at the age were that has expired and those types are not my style. All respect to all that do enjoy that life. Just not I.

I am rather simple and low key, hopefully not boring.
So if you like what you read, than please by all means reply, maybe we will hit it off.

I know this is a bit unorthodox, but I thought I'd give it a try.

I don't live in Seattle. I'm all the way on the other side of the country, in Richmond, VA.

But I'm looking for a friend, someone to talk with. Chatting via email/messenger/txt. Everyone I know here in RVA knows everyone else, it seems. Sometimes you need an unbiased outside opinion!

I'm an artist. I love creating things. I'm polyamorous, partnered, queer, quiet... I am a shy introvert in the ""real world"" but an open book when talking in written word. Also, with some level of anonymity, it's much easier to open up and chat about anything.

Tell me something interesting!

I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking for, and I probably won't find it by posting on Craigslist, but who knows?! If this is up, I'm still looking.

It seems so difficult building a friendship in Seattle. I have many theories on why that is, but none are relevant, at the moment. What I wish could happen was that someone could let go and instantly dive into a deep, playful, meaningful friendship. Maybe just today/tonight, maybe on-going. What I wish is that I could find THAT friend. That guy/girl friendship that isn't a FWB, but also isn't afraid to admit we are attracted to each other at times, and act on it. That guy/girl friendship that can cuddle on a couch or curl up in bed when we don't have significant others. That guy/girl friendship built on trust, communication and a tremendous amount of honesty.

I feel like it's possible. I feel like it's possible to do it instantly too, but it takes an adventurous soul that is rare. Someone who is willing to let their guard down immediately and get to know a stranger under unusual circumstances. 

I have read a few posts on here that make me believe it's possible. Possible to leave everything at the door and just... be. Possible to be fully exposed. Possible to have a friendship that isn't based on sex, but isn't sexless either. Possible to allow yourself to connect. Who wants to take a leap? Who is adventurous to just show up and pretend we've known each other for years. To immediately fall into fun, playful and honest? Cuddling on the couch? Curling up and reading? Hot showers? Movies? 

Who's in? I am. 

I don't have to see a picture right away, but I will want to see one. I will happily send one in return (after I have gotten yours). I am serious, and not looking for tons of messages back and forth. Just enough to let each other feel comfortable and know we aren't the wrong kind of crazy.

Hello ladies, 

I am looking for more romance and companionship than sex, heres why;

I identify as a gay man. lately i have been curious about women. I have never been in a relationship before, i have taken a hard look at what i have been doing in life. i get along much better with females than i seem to with males. im attracted to the male body more. but females have the love and compassion where in the gay world its all about the hookup.

im looking to befriend a woman who would like to get to know me as i would her. go out on dates, relax with and just be really cool with. Im looking for someone around my age. (29) so we have things in common with each other and can do things.

I have been lonely and feel that if i open my horizon to women maybe we can fill each others voids.

Im not looking for sex per say-- although if the oppurtunity presents itself i may want to try. but no NO pressure. im open to chatting on text or kik or even email if thats what works for you.

its April. time to open up and explore some options.

i am overweight. i understand this. im not looking for a super model. just be a decent human!

heres my mugshot!

Hey there!

The good news is that it's a BEAUTIFUL Saturday and the weekend is here. The bad news is that I'm feeling a bit feisty and have zero plans. Are you in the same boat? Wanna grab a pitcher of beer and play a game of pool (I'm terrible, by the way...)? Get jacked up on caffeine and watch ""Batman vs. Superman"" (I've heard it sucks, but as a lifelong Batman fan, I have to see it) or ""Deadpool"" (I've seen it and I wanna see it again)? Grab a bite and a pint somewhere yummy? See if there's any good bands playing at a local pub? Start our own cult? I'm single, not looking for anything more than finding someone awesome to paint the town red with, work in management, goofy, and a firm believer in the Oxford comma.

I'm a full time grad student and single mom. I'm graduating this summer and job hunting. I don't have much free time, but when I do I love to be outdoors! Especially since the weather is getting warmer. :) I don't hang out at bars or gamble, and I've found it hard to meet people here outside of school/work related stuff. 

**Kitsap County only** I don't want us to have to drive an hour or more just to meet up. 

I'll probably have to move for work, so I want to see as much of this area as I can before that. I'm looking for someone who wants to explore the local parks and trail systems with me. Right now I tend to max out at a 10 mile hike, but that will get longer as I do it more. FYI, I don't bike. Love dogs, feel free to bring one if you have one! It's cool if you're military (I'm a navy vet). 

I have a lot of friends that are older, so I'd like to find some people my age or younger. Please be fit/athletic. Not looking for a hookup or FWB! Just want some to get out of the house and do something active. :)

If you're interested please send a pic so I know you're real, and change the subject line to the town you live in. All other emails will be deleted as spam. More than one sentence helps too. Thanks and enjoy the sunshine!

Some of my hobbies include hiking (beginner status); playing video games (mostly PC but only because I like owning money more than I like owning consoles); watching UFC; and going to comedy shows (looking forward to Joe Rogan in April). 

I don't drink but I am 420 friendly if you're down. I've been getting into going to the gym/ working out so maybe an exercise buddy would be nice.

Hi I'm from Everett looking to make some new friends. A little about me I am 44 years young,In a committed relationship and have two boys ages 7 and 9. Don't worry I can get out of the house (daddy can watch them)

Looking to hang out and have some girl time. I love the outdoors,Love to hike and walk,Swimming,Love cooking,Thrift shopping,Movies,Live bands,Comedy, ect.....

Would love to get to know a couple new friends. I am non judgmental,spontaneous,outgoing but also socially awkward at first. I'm the type of friend you can call anytime and I will be there for you.

I am usually available Mon-Thurs during the day when kids are in school and can hang out later if we plan for it.Also available to meet up on occasional weekends. Would love to meet a active friend that has some common interests as me.Would love to start off with messages,texting and Facebook and meet up shortly afterwards.

I'm in my early 40s, work in the technology sector, have a car, I don't smoke, use any drugs, although I like to drink socially. I have one grown daughter who doesn't live with me.

Who I would like to meet is a single female, that means not married, not dating, not ""kind of seeing someone"", SINGLE. I don't want to deal with any boyfriend or husband drama.

Non smoker (not ""trying to quit""), no pot or any street drugs, and no little kids. By that I mean, old enough to do their own thing, no babysitter, they have their own life.

I'm open to many things. Farmers markets, swimming, outdoor events, taking a walk, window shopping, going out for some drinks, having dinner, and plenty more. However, I don't want to go see a movie anytime soon because the purpose of getting together is to talk and get to know each other, and a movie does not work for that.

The purpose of my writing this is to meet someone. I'm not against relationships or getting serious. I wrote it in strictly platonic because to me, the regular dating section is for those strictly wanting to meet someone for a relationship. I'm looking for a friendship. If it leads to more, that is great, but if it doesn't, I understand. I'm not going to expect sex.

Material items don't matter to me. I never liked those who have to flaunt what they have. I like down to earth, realistic people who just appreciate others and are respectful.

I am a little old fashioned. Opening doors, complimenting, being on time (not 15 minutes late and saying no big deal), buying dinner, and getting to know someone, with no expectations.

My lifestyle is a night owl. I can get up at 5 or 6 am if I have to (such as the house is on fire... well, even then I'm not sure), but by default I get up later in the morning and go to bed late. If your day ends at 6, 7, 8 pm, and you don't want to go out at all, then I'm not the right person. That doesn't mean I want to be out at 2 am, but I don't shut down at 6 pm either. There is nothing wrong with staying home to watch a movie or TV, I like that as well, I just don't want to be home every night.

Your location isn't real important (as long as your address isn't the state prison), but at least in the beginning, we need to meet half way. I'm not driving an hour to be stood up. It has happened.

I would like to meet someone who will make effort to stay in touch. Doesn't matter if we call, text, email, but I do expect effort on both sides.

Also, getting together fairly regularly matters. I'm not interested in anybody who has to pencil me in on her calendar 3 weeks from now, then once a month afterwards. No thank you.

If you like what you have read so far, please write back and tell me about yourself. That does not mean write one sentence saying ""hey... what's up? wanna talk?"" I delete those replies.

I can tell you much more about myself once we get to know each other. I don't hide anything and I don't lie. If I did lie, I wouldn't remember what I said, so it is just easier to be honest.

I believe in communication, honesty, trust, and integrity. If I say I will be somewhere at 5, I will be there at 5, not 5:30 with some lame excuse. If I say I will do something, I do it.

I don't have many friends here in Seattle so I guess I'm looking for someone that I can explore the parks and nature in general with. They are great miniature forests with creeks here in Seattle and If you weren't aware of this before you'll be pleasantly surprised. 

I'm a 21 old full time student that's physically active. I've been told I'm easy on the eyes but also I'm not strictly looking for a relationship - we can just enjoy the nature together. - I won't care how you look like.

I don't have a car right now so if you have one there're places in 1 hour driving distance that I want to go on explore in !

Contact me and we'll get to know each other better before embarking into new adventures !

I'm 24 years old, and believe it or not... I'm not ruled by my dick. I focus while in the gym, but also love being around beautiful, driven women. I'm not opposed to being checked out/ sending a few glances your way if you look great in yoga pants, and would love to have a partner to work up a sweat with in the steam room after training. That said, I am focused on my goals and would help you reach and achieve your own.

Hopefully we could become friends and have this become a consistent thing. I'm a fun, fit, no drama kind of guy who loves to go hard in the gym. Im about 5'11, 185 lbs and train as a competitive weightlifter as well as do yoga regularly.

So here's the thing: I am trying to get out into the world as much as possible. My close friends moved away to different parts of the country, and the ones in the area have been so busy with their own lives. I too have been kept busy with work and school, but things are beginning to settle, and I have a feeling that it would be nice to meet new people. Who does not like making new friends?

I am pretty open-minded, love movies, and I am getting back into reading regularly. I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree, where I'm an economics/philosophy/political science major. Running is something I am re-learning to do (I was previously an avid runner), and I am training for a couple 5Ks. I savor the experience of food, especially Thai, where I cannot resist a good plate of pad see ew or pad kee mao. I'm learning to cook and I like comic books, so I have a few geeky moments.

I enjoy witty banter, have hobbies, and genuinely ask questions, so conversation will never be short.

Hello!

Just looking for someone to venture out with while the weather is beginning to warm up! I'm looking for someone who enjoys similar things to myself:
Going on walks or hikes
Trying not new restaurants 
Venturing out to new places 
Road trips 
Mariners games or summer events in Seattle
Eating out at places 

This is strictly just friends. I want to find someone who enjoys venturing out or enjoying the simple things in life with me. Also looking for someone who is between the ages of 21-30. 

A little about me :
I'm 22, and Asian if that matters. I have a bubbly personality so I'm easy to converse with. I'm in school right now and have my own car for transportation. 

If this interests you, please feel free to contact me. Hope to hear from you soon! :)

Additionally, I would also like to take my little dog on the occasional hike, so maybe if we become fast friends we can do some hiking as well! Essentially, I am just looking for some outdoor pals.

I'm 34 and I moved to Seattle last fall for work. I am guaranteed to be here until October, at which point I may move again; it really depends on work. I work in the healthcare field and I have a special interest in trans healthcare (please no homophobes).

As I understand it, we learn to be a man or at least confidence from our folks, from our peers and finally from ourselves. I got really ripped off in the folks department. As a kid, I didn't fare so well with my peers. I did my best to develop self-confidence. It turns out what I developed was a way looking like confident and masculine. But, if I can be honest I feel weak and inadequate.

I don't know how to ask people to give me encouragement so that maybe I can believe I am the guy they think I am. Since I don't have the confidence to ask my friends, can I ask you? Will you be my friend? Will you help build me up and encourage me? Be honest with me? I will do the same for you. I am looking forward to meeting you. I am not sure that it matters, but it may be best if we are approximately the same age or at least within a decade of each other.

Or they are married. Oh and my favorite, only looking for sex and pretending to be truly submissive in everyday life which is what I seek. What gives? Yes, I've tried the websites. Fetlife and whatnot. No such luck. Just a meat market really. 

Yes, I am aware that it's unconventional and rare in most cases. This lifestyle does exist and I'm looking for it with no shame. I am also not looking to debate. Lol

I love seeing my girlfriend wearing a thong bikini and she loves wearing one. The problem is that most beaches and lakes don't have many other women wearing such skimpy swimwear. I wonder if there are any other couples or women out there that would enjoy wearing skimpy bikinis but don't because of being the minority and drawing too much attention from jealous and prudish people that may be around. I thought why not try and meet others and form a group of thong lovers for days on or near the water where the women can feel comfortable and free from the judgement of others who may not approve. Not sure if this will go anywhere but it never hurts to try. I started a Kik group called thongbikinilovers.

I've been posting on here for some time now, and most of the women that reply are big''
+ sized'', or just all around ugly'', I don't know what the deal is up here in the northwest,
what are all the women doing, sitting around and eating all day, or what''.
I post something on here, and 90% of the women that send me a pic are big.
I just don't get it, is craigslist the place for big women to hang out or what.
Now wen ever I do meet a nice looking woman on here, and I send my pic back,
I never hear from them anymore, so I must be ugly too.
It's just funny how ugly doesn't like ugly'',
I look for women that are more on the pleasant looking side,
I also in joy talking to younger women too, but there must be something about my age.
I don't think I'm old be any means, but the younger women don't want anything to do with me.
O'', by the way, I'm only looking for friends, low drama, pleasant looking, a little extra pounds is ok,
just don't be BBW'', I can click with big women, I just don't want to be friends with them.
I don't know why I feel that way, it's just how I feel, sorry to all the big people out there .
But at the same time I've been told I go after homely women, and just pleasant looking people,
and why don't I just try a little harder for a good looking women,
I don't know why, I just like pleasant looking people''
So that's my post for today, I'm not trying to piss anyone off, I'm just pointing out my feelings.

I love seeing my girlfriend wearing a thong bikini and she loves wearing one. The problem is that most beaches and lakes don't have many other women wearing such skimpy swimwear. I wonder if there are any other couples or women out there that would enjoy wearing skimpy bikinis but don't because of being the minority and drawing too much attention from jealous and prudish people that may be around. I thought why not try and meet others and form a group of thong lovers for days on or near the water where the women can feel comfortable and free from the judgement of others who may not approve. Not sure if this will go anywhere but it never hurts to try. I started a Kik group called thongbikinilovers. Feel free to check it out if you are interested in meeting like minded people and see what develops.

I am generally a happy person. I find joys in the simple things of life. But when you are in a marriage and you lose the emotional connection things can look dismal.

But we soldier on. We do the right thing. We make decisions that is best for everybody. And in the process of it all things we need are left out. And then one day you find yourself here on craiglist looking at personal ads. Clearly something went wrong. But I am here and you are here reading this. Most of the world has even moved passed craigslist. With the birth of the app markets online dating has completely changed. But when you are married and seeking a covert emotional connection you don't want to put your picture on Tinder. Ashley Madison, data leak aside, just seems too dirty, and makes the whole thing official.

As far as I can tell Craigslist is the only place where I can post with a degree of being anonymous and find somebody with similar thoughts. But for the most part it is a barren wasteland. I might write a really clever post and only get some scammers to reply. And they are not even the good scammers! They are the brain dead obvious ones.

I am posting this as strictly platonic because that is how our relationship should start. It should start with no expectations, no guarantee of chemistry. Rather it is two people who are married and both resonated a feeling of emptiness and loneliness. From there we chat, share, and maybe even meet for lunch. Who knows how far it can go. . .or how short.

For the record I am 41, work in Bellevue, in reasonably good shape, and despite writing this ad, mostly sane. What about you?

The picture is from Crossroads mall...not too far from where I work.

Mid 50s divorced bi guy here. My sexual passion is to push my boundaries. I enjoy experimenting. I'm 420 friendly, I drink occasionally - socially, and I love porn; three things which have negatively impacted past relationships so I thought I'd just put that right out there in front. I am masculine but I enjoy cooking, nice clothes, and romantic old movies. I absolutely love to kiss, hold hands, and I am very playful. My sense of humor is sometimes goofy, sometimes dry, and sometimes sarcastic. 
I love finding new restaurants; the type of food doesn't matter because I love everything. I enjoy all types of movies except the Friday the 13th or Halloween type killer movies. I am very fond of indie movies. I am a sports fan too; go Seahawks! I like long walks and hiking. I enjoy fishing; and, to a lesser degree camping. like country drives and antique shops. I love to read and I write a little. 
I like masculine guys. Guys who are around my age; say 45-60ish and who love outdoor as well as indoor activities. I like independant guys; men who are comfortable in their own skin and who can handle any situation as it comes. I am smooth bodies but I love hairy chests. I enjoy mutual nipple play but that is for later....

Hello,

This is very much a real posting. :)

49 yo handsome man. 6'1"" 220lb. Solid/Large/ Football type build. Cleancut. Brn hair/eyes
Are you possibly bored, in a rut, too busy with work and life.... BUT, miss respectful flirting, exchange of playful and witty banter??

It would be a plus if you live in the North end or Eastside, in the event that we might want to meet in person. :))

I am very sweet, and sincere. Playful, silly personality. Nonjudgmental.

If you would like to know more and are equally comfortable sharing a very normal and safe guy, please respond with a picture and a brief note about yourself!

Have a GREAT Monday!

Perhaps I can help.
I am not a doctor but most doctors today ask their patients to get those pounds off!!!

I have workout program that is adjusted just for you. You train at my home gym and we talk food and good health.

Not intending this to be about sex. Don't think my heart could take it. Lol 
I am married and love my wife, however over the years we have grown apart. We just don't talk that much. She does her thing I do mine. 

I miss the female connection so I'm hoping to find a woman that wants to talk, share jokes, discuss anything including but not limited to sex. I'm an older mature man with 55 years of experience on this planet. Sure I have a few good stories. I'm a retired Navy guy and a father and grandfather. I have many interests such as singing, playing cards, bowling, golfing, movies, and more. 

I'm just seeking a friend to lift my spirit a bit. I'm fully retired so I do have time to talk or hang out with ya. I'm very open minded. I do not judge. I may form an opinion but I keep that to myself. I'm not shallow at all. So if you could use a guy friend let me know. I don't care about your age or how tall you are or if you can juggle. Though you do need to be 18 or over. I'm a lonely old man but not a pervert lol. 

Think about it. I live in chehalis and hoping to find a friend in the local area but won't mind traveling sometimes. Let me know.

I'm a recently self-discovered woman looking to make friends, chat, etc... but mostly just to have some friends who know me as a woman, not a guy. For my psychological health, I need some male attention focused on me as a woman. I know it sounds weird, but I'm not minding a little bit of a sexist/misogynistic vibe (lightly so) or even some flirtatiousness. I am flirty (fourtwofive) and kind and just looking (twoseventwo) to be more in my own gender identity (fivenineeightone). I hope that makes some kind of sense.

Hi there!

I'm a nerd-inclined, open-minded, midwest-transplant hoping to make new girlfriends in the Seattle area. I like comedy, anime, cartoons, art, music, people-watching, crafts, food, video and board games. I also get really excited about anything to do with cute animals. 

I'm 420 friendly and it'd be nice if you are too for ice-breaking but that's not a requirement. I'd like to find someone who might be interested in taking a yoga class, because I'm super into yoga now, and I'd love to find people to play Magic the Gathering with as well. I'm also very interested in exploring the outdoors here and learning more about sustainable/green living.

I like being upfront and honest with people, but I also love sarcasm.

I don't understand sports, I don't like organized religion but I respect other people's choices as long as they respect mine. I care about politics (liberal/socialist, feel the Bern!). I am LGBT friendly and try to respect and understand all people :)

If any of this sounds appealing to you please respond with something interesting about yourself so we can start a dialogue. I am only interested in platonic friendships so please no creepers!!!

Also I don't have a car but I'm working on mastering public transportation!

So, I know this is a thing but I've never asked a stranger.

Do you want to cuddle?

I'm talking about laying/spooning on the couch together fully clothed. Shoulder rubs could happen at some point by mutual agreement. Either way I do like to touch so you should expect my fingers to be lightly caressing your arms or back. Of course I wouldn't touch anywhere you didn't want it.
Since the whole point of this is comfort I'd suggest we meet first somewhere like a coffee shop and feel out each other's vibe. If we could see ourselves relaxing with the other person then we can work on logistics. I can host.
Practically speaking; while I'm tall and slender the back rests don't come off of my stupid couch and we would both have to fit. 
As for what we'd watch. I have Netflix and stream, don't watch reality tv or sports and other than that I'm open.

It'll help if we have similar interests but could be that much more fun if not. I'm retiring in 8 months, 'god willing and the creek don't rise'. My immediate goal will be to hit the road for a year or so as the RV lifestyle draws me. From thence who knows, a Mexican beach pallapa or some such, who knows.
I'd like to know what your plans for the future are, might there be a similar thread in your pattern. A capable and companionable partner for a short or longer term adventure would be a welcome addition to this first outing from the mother ship.
I am in over all good health and plan to keep it that way. No tobacco, moderation otherwise. If you are at a point in your life that a vagabond's existence carries any allure, drop me a line. Let us meet for a dram.

I'm looking for a few adventure buddies who would be interested in hiking, exploring new corners of Seattle, technology and interesting lectures, Moth style storytelling, riding bikes, finding new great restaurants, playing board games etc. Interested in live music? Yes. Interested in hanging out at the bars? No. Entering an organized run? In the near future. Committing to couch to 5K and then 10K? Yes!

I'm 35 and female. Platonic replies only. I'm not really concerned about age/gender and more interested in open minds.

Cheers!

I am a married white male with an desk job open to casual emails, maybe some flirting or possibly more. Just looking for that one woman who is sitting at home drinking coffee reading these ads for fun but doesn't usually respond. Marriage is ok but missing that spark or connection for many years. Would love to meet someone in similar situation who is open to talking but not sure they want to take it further. I have never been with another woman but not opposed to it with the right person. 
I am an attractive HWP man, down to earth, mid 40's, great sense of humor, witty and sarcastic at times. I can be a little shy at the start but if I feel a connection with someone I can open up pretty easily. Looking for similar in a woman.
Maybe just emailing, flirting, possibly meeting for coffee or ?. Hope to hear from you.

I'm a highly intelligent, laid back, responsible, fun, friendly, caring, healthy human being who is available in the morning for doing stuff like: skateboarding, playing video games, watching movies/shows, gardening, shopping, eating food, walking, hiking... basically whatever! I can also teach you how to play guitar, bass, and drums, and record music on your computer if you're interested.

Not really interested in: kids, drama, religion.

Good luck finding a more fun, interesting, open minded, easy going, creative, calmly driven, hyper-eligible and heterosexual, biped, humanoid anywhere this side of West Seattle! If you think you can, bring this alleged subject before me so I may learn his ways, or not... 
uhh... Bragging about myself is not my strong point.
Modesty is blindingly more noble than arrogance or competitiveness. 
However, I do probably need to at least explain and describe myself.
so here goes: 
I am the proud inventor of the SpiderWhistle.(c)
Spiders of every kind come 'a runnin' from all directions fast as lightning with one blow of my new and improved SpiderWhistle.(c)
IMPORTANT NOTICE: Don't forget to have plenty of SpiderChow.(c) on hand as it is NOT recommended to tease spiders. Remember that serving anything other than ""SpiderChow (c)"" brand Spider food may cause spiders to become aggressive toward the whistle-blower.
Children ages 3 and under ""should"" be supervised. 
Use caution in densely wooded, tropical areas near the equator. 
Seek medical attention immediately if / when a spider attack occurs. 

I'm a Licensed and Certified Professionalologist, but I try not to let it get to my head. 
Also a self proclaimed Intellectual Magician / Professional Musician / Freelance Comedian / Experimental Philosopher / Makeshift Psychonautical Neuropharmacologist / Perspective Expander / Love Provider & Receiver / Under-vindicated Malingerer / Emotionally Mature Subgenius / Eccentric Unobtainium Collector. 
At times I tend to become a bit compunctous in the profundity of intellectual confabulations, as my vocabulary is inexplicably breviloquent, and I have little to no comprehension whatsoever of the vast verbicullarly linguistic proclivities randomly strewn throughout the entire modern English Lexicon. In other words, I'm highly uneducated, so language is basically like, just a bunch a werds i ain evin tryin uh fill my brainz wif cuz iss too full uh poo ahready!
Oh yeah, I should probably also mention something about my ""Deliberate Tourette's Syndrome"" which I acquired while vacationing in Sub-Space-Zer0 via un-airborne imagi-pathogen-nation.
so, moving on...
If there's anything particular you don't enjoy about me or my ridiculous banter, PLEASE tell me, & lay it on thick too, I mean really make it sting, I can take it. lol...
Insane, how people really believe that ""words can hurt"". HA!
There's always room for improvement from what I've been told, but who knows... who cares, 
or not. Whuddoo eye no!
PS. Not into needing or being an emotional sponge, jealousy, control, deception, desperation, ridiculous expectation, impersonal tradition, arrogant narcissism, racism, sexism, fascism, or closed mindedness, so I guess that means I'm open to any of the above, because I'm just THAT open-minded. I'd even be down for some crazy-ass, whack'd out fetish shit that exclusively incorporated all the above, as long as we can have insane screaming arguments in public regarding the most unlikely subjects, accompanied by reverse psychology body language. 
Allow me to present a scenario;
SO FAR, THIS AD HAS ONLY ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF MEN, AND MEN WHO DRESS AS WOMEN, SOME VERY CONVINCINGLY, AS WELL AS STRATEGICALLY TRYING TO BAIT ME INTO HOMOSEXUAL ENCOUNTERS. I GET HIT ON BY GUYS PLENTY ON CAPITOL HILL, CAUSE I PROBABLY LOOK LIKE A BEAR, AND I FEEL FLATTERED AND HONORED AND IT'S A GREAT FEELING TO BE DESIRED, AND I WOULD TOTALLY KICKIT WITH THOSE DUDES LIKE PLATONIC STYLEE, AND BULLSHIT ABOUT BREEDERS. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY ANYONE WOULD EVER EVEN THINK ABOUT, LET ALONE CARE ABOUT ENOUGH TO TALK ABOUT ANOTHER PERSONS SEXUALITY OR DIET OR POLITICS OR RELIGION OUTSIDE OF THEIR INTIMATE CIRCLE OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS! ALSO, I'M BEGINNING TO BELIEVE THAT ABSOLUTELY NO SINGLE CUTE FEMALES IN SEATTLE ARE WASTING TIME LOOKING FOR LOSERS ON CRAIGSLIST WHEN THEY COULD BE AT A SPORTS BAR SCORING STUD AFTER STUD. NO JUDGING IF YOU DO, I PROBABLY WOULD TOO IF DOUCHE BAGS WERE MY THANG.

Hello!

I'll start with a bit about me and then what I'm looking for. 23, Mill Creek area, on the bigger side. Have tattoos and piercings. I enjoy music, watching tv, cooking, trying new restaurants, 420 friendly, playing pool, bowling, movies, shopping, and spending too much time on Fallout 4 recently. I have a nice car and a full time job. Recently got out of a relationship so I'm trying to stay busy and meet new people to chat and eventually meet. Not looking for sex. 

You: be normal. Be mobile. Have the ability to hold a conversation. Funny and honest are big in my books. No one over 40. Just don't think we would have enough in common. Nerds are cool too. Send me a message with a bit about yourself.

I am married, and I am fine if you are. I am willing to drive you back and forth, if you are around Bellevue/Redmond/Kirkland. I am into cycling and jogging as well.

I am also open to other activities if the situation lends itself to it, like eating out, coffee, walking, or just hanging out. No pressure, and no unnecessary expectations; let's just have fun.

I don't know where to start..
So I guess I should just start..

I am a damn good man but I have always had bad luck with women.
It seems like I was always picking up the pieces of the damage that another man has left..
Figured that was just how the cards fell for my life.

I recently met someone new and I have never felt so strongly about someone as I have for her..
I truly care for her and I can see such a solid future with her.
I figure maybe things are finally going my way..


Long story short.

She was cheated on in her previous relationship which was why she was single..

She recently got tested and broke the news to me that the person who cheated on her gave her herpes and she wanted me to be the first to know..

I am a man of patience and understanding but I don't know if I can overcome what I heard.

I am angry, I am shocked, I am hurt,I am alot of things..

I honestly feel like I can't get a break and that I continue to enter someone that has been dealt serious damage from someone previous..


So what I'm looking for is advice..
I truly adore this woman..
She makes me happy.
she would make me happy and keep me happy.
She is a good woman and I know she didn't deserve what happened to her.



I normally am the one that gives the advice but I can't think right now.
I'm in tears writing this posting.
just need someone to talk to.


What am I to do with a situation and news like this???

I roll my own cigarettes and use empty king size hard packs to pack and carry my smokes, now my old packs are getting very worn!
I have acquired both the plastic and metal cigarette cases commonly sold in tobacco shops and online, but they aren't what I prefer or use. The reason is because with a cigarette hard pack I can just reach in for a smoke and lighter and light up in one easy motion. 
Those hard cases they sell involve removing the pack from my purse and digging out a cigarette... Hey, there are enough people who want to bum my wonderful rollies as it is without calling the extra attention to the fact that I've got (""free!"") smokes ;) . :( Also, those manufactured cigarette boxes don't load as easily as my reused hard packs. 
So there you have my reasons...
If you or anyone you know smokes non-menthol king size hard pack cigarettes and are willing to pass the boxes along, please get in touch with me.
I am partial to Marlboro Lights, American Spirit or Camel packs, but I'm open as long as they're in good shape and not menthol! Regardless of the brand, they would need to be king size to serve my purposes.
I am willing to buy these if we can agree on a fair price.
I posted this under 'Wanted' and didn't get any response. In the spirit of posting in this platonic section I will add that if I met someone compatible who wanted to walk around the city smoking, as this weather gets nicer, I would think of that as a nice happenstance.

She is 34 hwp, drinks and is 420 friendly, fucking loves reading(always a book in here hands).Love punk and rockabilly.
Me, im 36 hwp, same as above but dont read unless its a manual or instructions. Like to work old trucks and vehicles that dont require a masters degree to work on.

We both like to get out and stay in...kinda oxymoron of us. But we like bars and casinos and going to shows. Also like staying in playing pool or darts or just watching a movie. Occasionally you will see are ass up on the cle elum river tubing down it or at our camping spot.

What we want from you is someone who is fun and pleasant to be around.Around our age. Open minded and understanding. Someone who will keep us on our toes and wants to have what i hope will be a friendship. 

Hope to hear from you soon.

So here's the thing: I am trying to get out into the world as much as possible. My close friends moved away to different parts of the country, and the ones in the area have been so busy with their own lives. I too have been kept busy with work and school, but things are beginning to settle, and I have a feeling that it would be nice to meet new people. Who does not like making new friends?

I am pretty open-minded, love movies, and I am getting back into reading regularly. I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree, where I'm an economics/philosophy/political science major. Running is something I am re-learning to do (I was previously an avid runner), and I am training for a couple 5Ks. I savor the experience of food, especially Thai, where I cannot resist a good plate of pad see ew or pad kee mao. I'm learning to cook and I like comic books, so I have a few geeky moments.

I enjoy witty banter, have hobbies, and genuinely ask questions, so conversation will never be short.

My chest is heavy, breathing fast, but not able to catch my breath. Thoughts swirling in my head, all lead to the same question, is this it? Sitting down on the park bench, I stare up into the cold dark sky. Slowly a new world opens up, the dust from the Milky Way starts to glow. Before long, the sharp pain in my chest eases up and the light headed feeling is gone. With my head in my hands I wonder how I got here. Is this really my life as I expected it? Wanted it? Where did the years go? Its funny to stare into such a vast space, knowing how big the universe is and yet feeling all alone, such an insignificant feeling.

What happened to the days of feeling so alive? The days when loving and being loved was all the mattered. When did it change to careers, finances and kids leaving no time to each other. I miss the passion. I miss the unconditional love, attention and affection. The spark that seemed that ignited my world and the feeling of giving myself to someone and getting them in return.

What is it that I really want? Adventure. The excitement of something new. The feeling of standing at the edge of cliff and taking that leap of faith into the waters below. I want the summer of 69, the days that have long since past and the romance that was with them. The kind of love that is intense and in the moment, even though we know it isn't meant to last. I want steamy car windows and being spontaneous. I want my heart to race every time I get a text message, call or email. I want to embrace this life once again.

What am I looking for? Someone who wants what I want. It really is that simple. Age isn't nearly as important, though it should be said you better be old enough to get into a bar, casino and or vote. Really, if you are old enough that you don't even get carded, that works for me. As for me, I grew up with the A-Team, Doogie Howser and Saved By the Bell. Please know that I'm looking for someone real. Not just real thoughts and emotions, but some kind of physical contact. Yes this is a crazy world and I am absolutely ok with being safe, taking things slow and meeting for coffee or lunch to start. It all starts with you though, all it takes is a reply.

H! Have you ever played foot-golf? Me neither, but I found a groupon for it, and it looks amazing! What about a drunk history tour of Seattle, or maybe a 3 hour wine tasting and painting class?

I just moved to Capitol Hill and while not all of these events are on the Hill, I am looking for Hill-ites to meet and hangout with. I am a very social person, and very high energy, and a lot of fun. I have a witty and sometimes dry sense of humor. I'm not book educated, however am very intelligent, not that you have to be, you just have to be fun! But don't surprised if I end up going off about the 1st amendment right and Larry Flynt, or how going to a fully socialist system will destroy medical innovation in this country.

I am a good guy, I will be there for my friends for anything. I don't drink (medical reasons, not happy about it) and am 420 friendly.

I'm a huge movie buff, video game nerd, etc. love music. I love to bust my friends balls, and have them bust mine (figuratively speaking). Anyways if you want to know more about me then hit me up.

""Your presence makes me feel like I have been transported to another place where gentleness, kindness, giggles and love are in charge. . . During yesterday's cuddle, I saw the light of heaven in your eyes and I kept feeling the touch of an Angel."" --John (my first cuddle client), January 18, 2016 (following our fourth session).

ABOUT ME

I began professional cuddling in December 2015, but I have been a cuddle enthusiast for as long as I can remember. I believe consensual, non-sexual touch is profoundly powerful and essential to a happy life. Oxytocin (the hormone produced when humans touch) can decrease stress, boost the immune system, crystallize memories, and fight insomnia. Touch deprivation is detrimental to our well-being, and I want to help end it -- one cuddle at a time!

I am empathetic, nurturing, playful, expressive, and down-to-earth. People generally feel comfortable and relaxed in my presence. Given my own happiness is strongly dependent upon the happiness of others, I put forth tremendous effort into ensuring those around me are bubbling over with bliss and positive energy. I like to call that my ""positive feedback loop.""

CUDDLING SESSIONS

Prior to a session, I provide prospective clients with a copy of my guidelines (to outline my process, what I offer, and what I don't offer) and a brief questionnaire (to help me understand your specific wants and needs). Then we will talk via phone or Skype to go over any questions/concerns and feel out our cuddling chemistry. If both parties consent, we will move forward with booking a session!

I offer in-call sessions at my personal space in Ballard, or a therapeutic rental space in West Seattle. I'm also available for out-calls in the Seattle area for an additional travel fee. My rate is $80/hour. The length of a session can range from 1.5 to 4 hours. 

In all sessions, you will receive my undivided attention with unconditional love and acceptance. Sessions are completely customizable and based on mutual consent. You are invited to share anything with me in a completely judgement-free, confidential environment. 

To be heard, hugged and held, come cuddle with me!

I grew up in a small town and attended a Baptist Church like many other good little boys. This extraordinarily precocious girl, C. S., also attended the church. I knew her all through junior high and high school. She wore these exceedingly tight skirts, nylons, and heels, tight knit blouses too. Since our preacher had convinced us that we were going to roast in hell for our wayward thoughts, mine seemingly, inevitably, became even more stimulated, wayward, and elaborate. I still remember the parties where she wore similar things, perhaps even tighter fitting, than she wore in church. She would sit on my lap and I would rest my hand on her textured nylon legs. I suspect she knew full well what was going on beneath her.
I wish that I could go back to that time and place knowing what I know now.
Any C.S.'s out there who always wanted to make it with the smartest, most sought after, best athlete in town? who went on to the big city and to some very rewarding things but who has always had you in the back of his mind somewhere, wondering if you were feeling the same thing he was all those years? Perhaps still are? Even platonically. Then there was S. S. and K. S. too.
Appreciation and/or quid pro quo's of all sorts considered.
Take me back and forward. Hint: small logging town; G. Creek

Okay, it's a long shot. But it seems like it might be a place to get an honest, yet anonymous answer. 

If a married woman is about to, um, ""step out"" on her husband, what are the signs? I really want to know. Working long hours, declining sex life, yes, I get all that. But what is going through a woman's head exactly? Is she seeking, shopping around for another man, only after which she will then end it with her husband? Or is it just a one time thing? Seems like it could not be an on going thing, as that would be risky. Is it emotional, as in, just wants attention? Or is it sexual only? Or is it not binary at all, and a bit mixed up?

I have friends who have tried the ""on the side"" route over time, and they categorically always get caught. So, it doesn't seem like a women would be that clueless, as men generally are more risk takers...right?

What is the public persona? Is it on line? Is it going out for a drink after work more consistently? Business conferences? Neighbors? Where does she look and make herself available?

Research.

NOTE BEFORE YOU READ MY AD: MANY MEN READ THIS, ARE NOT INTERESTED, BUT FEEL THEY HAVE TO GIVE ME SEX ADVICE. DON'T BOTHER. THE PROBLEM ISN'T WHAT YOU THINK IT IS. I DON'T NEED YOUR ADVICE, YOU DON'T KNOW MORE THAN MY DOCTOR, AND I HAVE BEEN AROUND THE BLOCK. IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN A PLATONIC INTELLECTUAL RELATIONSHIP, JUST MOVE ON.

Let's face it, at our age, there are a lot of us whose body parts aren't cooperating. My knees are killing me:-( And due to a drug given to my mother during her pregnancy with me, my intimate parts don't work correctly anymore. It has stopped me from posting in the romantic section. But I miss male companionship and affection. We both just see our malfunctioning body parts as a natural part of the aging process of life instead of a loss, and neither one of us is going to let that stop us from having a close, loving, fun, long-term relationship. I'm 63 years of age, 5' 5"", divorced, have waste long brown hair, a few more pounds than I would like (but not obese), very healthy (no high blood pressure, no high cholesterol, no diabetes). Things that I like to do: I love live shows of all kinds (plays, comedy, opera, concerts, restaurants with live music, etc.), science (especially archaeology, paleontology and astrophysics), museums, the beach, Sunday afternoon trips, cozy warm snuggling by the fire, cuddling while watching a movie, good wine, ethnic restaurants, National Geographic, The Big Bang Theory (the TV show) and dancing. Hoping to spend some of the winter months in Hawaii or Arizona in three years when I retire. Want to visit Egypt and Italy, and would love to explore the U.S. in an RV someday (I especially love the Southwest). I am happy, secure and independent. I love going out with my friends and won't give that up, but miss the companionship and affection of a man. Most importantly, we both love to laugh! If you think you want to try to make me laugh, tell me something about yourself and SEND ME A PHOTO (most of you seem to miss this request). I will send you a photo and more about myself, if I think there will be a connection. PLEASE, NO MARRIED MEN (most of you seem to miss this request) no drug addicts, no alcoholics, no gamblers, no STDs (you may think this is a strange request if there is not going to be sex, but I have reasons), no smoking, and have employment or a secure retirement. PLEASE live within 30 minutes of Lynnwood and be between 59 and 68. Oh so, you think I am very picky for someone looking for a friend. But the fact is that I have plenty of friends and I like my life, so I am just looking for the RIGHT someone who will make it a little better. If you are not within my requested age range or distance, please don't bother me.

Starving writer looking for an intellectual friend in order to hang out and have a good time doing whatever our fancy dictates. In particular you being intelligently witty, creative and liking to talk about things above the daily grind will be most appreciated and inspirational to say the least. In other words if you have a beautiful mind I will enjoy your company for sure, regardless of interests, education or station in life. You being mature of mind is preferred (but age itself doesn't matter) as is someone who can laugh at the world and hold a good conversation inside or out the home, and all around the town and especially in the great outdoors.

Professional male coming to Seattle on Friday 4/22 for a work trip, but I'm coming early to walk around the city and explore. I'd love a travel companion for the weekend. I like to walk and explore, regardless of the weather. We can grab a craft beer in a pub for lunch, see the sights (maybe take a ferry across the sound to explore outside of the city) and then have a cocktail before a good dinner with a nice red wine. I like to watch people (serious amateur photographer), I like to see the places tourists don't see and I like to learn about the history of a place. Throughout the day, I will tell you absolutely anything you want to know about me. I will answer every question you put to me. I hope you'll share with me as well. There is nothing that helps people become instantly intimate than the anonymity of not knowing each other and knowing that we will soon part ways; it gives you freedom to say anything. I tend to click best with women in their 30's who have a liberal arts type of education or something in the social sciences area, though scientists and engineers are also fascinating, as is a barista who gets to watch people all day. Just be interesting and not bitter; who has time for that?!? For our little adventure, I will pay for everything, period. 

A little more about me: I'm a white male, professional with a grad degree. I am a consultant with a unique niche, which we can talk about later. I travel a fair bit. I'm in my late 40's, 6'2"" and tend toward the beefy side. I'm married and have kids. Again, there's a story there (isn't there always?!?). People tell me that I'm kind, I have a n air of confidence but not cockiness and I can be amusing. I also listen well and can talk with you for hours. I was in the navy as an officer and that helped me to see the world (yes, the cliche is true). I've been to Europe, Central America, the Mideast and SE Asia. The world gets more amazing the more you see of it...

So,. what do you think? Interested? If so, shoot me an email with a photo and ask me anything. I'll return a note to you with a few photos of me.

Singin' in the Rain: Classic Musical Makes a Splash The Cornish Playhouse at Seattle Center, Former Intiman Theatre, Seattle Center Campus, Northwest Corner ( 201 Mercer Street Seattle, WA 98109 ) 
In one of film's most iconic scenes, Gene Kelly famously partnered with an umbrella and tap danced through puddles in Singin' in the Rain. Now all the unforgettable songs and dances -- including the show-stopping title number -- have been lovingly adapted for the stage by Broadway legends Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Presented at The Cornish Playhouse at Seattle Center, the show's set in the days just after the success of the first talkies, when studio execs find themselves scrambling to salvage the career of Lina Lamont, a silent picture star with an iron-clad contract ... and a voice like a screech monkey. They decide to hire an aspiring actress to overdub Lina's voice -- but when the leading man falls in love with the voice-over girl, and the audience clamors for Lina to sing live, there's plenty of hilarious trouble afoot!

Im an open-minded person, gamer... mostly RPGs and older stuff. I really love all things history, philosophy, or anything that makes you think and learn. Just kinda been my thing. I'm 28 years old... Very sarcastic person with a dry sense of humor. If it seems like Im being a dick, I'm really not unless you're being a dick in the first place.

I'm into anyone who just needs someone to talk to, someone who plays games as well and likes to talk or meet up. People who are also open-minded to things... I don't care. I'm not here to judge....

Unfortunately cannot host due to the nature of my apartment, but looking to meet up around 5 or 6 tomorrow to cuddle up and watch an art film or two, preferably of your choosing but I can choose too if you're not experienced in the pseudo-genre (or you know, we could watch something else).

Now that we have nicer weather and more daylight, I'm looking for some people to join me in the great outdoors. Day hikes, snowshoeing, ski touring, mountaineering, backpacking, etc. I love to reach the quiet, pristine wilderness, which sometimes just requires a meandering walk along nice trails, and other times takes 2-3 hours of driving followed by 15, 20, even 25 miles of steep hiking over rough terrain. I don't go anywhere dangerous or extreme though, partly because I'm usually carting a bunch of camera gear! 

So I'm looking for people who are in pretty good shape for those longer trips, but are also fine with the simpler outings. And you'll have to put up with me stopping occasionally to set up a tripod and take lots of pictures. But hey, I have a high-clearance SUV that I can drive, and I'll offer to plan everything, so you shouldn't complain ;) Or if you want to take the lead planning and/or driving, that's fine too! 

You should live near Seattle so we can easily meet for our trips, and we'd probably be able to relate better if you're somewhere around my age, say no more than 10-15 years apart. Other than that, just have a personality that's fun to be around :)

Hey gals,

I am here looking to see if I can develop a friendship, wasn't quite sure where people go to meet people at my age so I'm trying here. 

I'm a part time worker and the old man's a night shifter so I spend a lot of time by myself which is okay most days! I would like to meet a gal that is equally interested in at home hangouts as well as getting out for adventures.

I'd say I'm pretty chill and open with who I am, questions just ask. I don't have any expectations on who or what my friend would look like and be. 

Interested in conversation send me a message. Look forward to meeting you.

Greetings, G'day

Aussie Frenchy here in the PNW just looking for a new mate. Hoping to meet someone for all sorts of endeavours, someone to text/chat and later hang about with. Close friends are far away and the loneliness is a bit of a drag. I miss my mate mates, just chatting about the day, going on errands, gaming, driving etc. I'd want to I could meet new folks out and about but lately it's been pretty difficult for some reason. What the hell is it with people being so into themselves ey? Maybe it's just be but that is what I see. So I thought that I would give this a go even though I've tried making mates thru digital means only to end in weird failure. Flaky folks seemed to be the theme of the people I've chatted with. Right then, well I'm pansexual, a good mate who believes friendship is something to cherish. In fact real friendship is bloody marvelous. I'm happy yet sad, you wouldn't know when the sad is about so don't worry if you think I'm a downer as I'm not. Rebel yet mellow, dark with light. I'm 28, athletic, sporting piercings, ink, and the attire ranges. I could be wearing a sport jacket with jeans or cargos, DCs, t and a hoodie (the norm for me). I travel heaps with a broad range of interests as well. As before I listed heaps of them here but now I will only name a few. Hiking, travel, listening to music (everything almost, from jazz and classical to the 70s, 80s and 90s punk. World tunes to electronica, indie, alternative, classic and modern rock etc etc blah blah) and creating it (love mixing eletronica and absolutely hate calling is EDM). I create electronica and love playing me didge, and piano. Vehicle related things as I'm a petrol head, being nostalgic, sitting on roofs, looking for E.T.s, chatting on about space, snow/skateboarding, reading, filming and photographing the world, helping folks and driving around listening to indie and going into your own world. Been a night owl lately so it can be a bit lonely. I'm looking for a good friend, easy as that, proud as punch. Not a friend on short term basis either. A friend for the ages. A GOOD MATE. Can't be to difficult to find that? I dunno perhaps it can.... Age range of friends is a pretty broad one. I know good people that I'm proud as punch to call mates ranging from 18 to 80s. If you're looking for a good friend as well, sit on a roof somewhere and just look at the view, talk and be proper mates, then please, send me a reply. I PREFER to chat thru kik, whatsapp, text or actual phone conversation. A few initial emails are OK however it seems that there are way too many flakes and bots thru email. Take care,
Ta!

Hello,

Bi guy looking for another bi or gay guy for a good friendship. I'm not looking to hook up, I would prefer someone intelligent to talk to. 

There are circumstances in my life that I cannot share with my current friends. I guess I'm kind of closeted at the moment. No, I don't need you to make me feel good about myself or help me out of a rut or anything like that. I am mentally stable and a professional individual. I don't suffer from low self esteem, quite the opposite actually. I'm fucking awesome! Haha

Send me an email. Let's discuss our hopes, dreams, career goals, bad drivers, British comedy, or whatever floats your boat. (Bonus points if you have a boat. Haha)

You don't need to send me dick pics. I know what they look like. However, I will happily accept them. Just don't expect one in return. At least not right away, we can get more flirty if that is what you want.

I guess I just get bored at my job and have loads of time to chat. So talk to me, let's be friends and see how awesome life can be together.

I am 27 years old. I enjoy learning, the outdoors, listening to music, playing acoustic guitar, writing music, reading genres including fantasy, classics, social sciences, history, and philosophy. I have been around the ocean my own life and lately I like the idea of living on a sailboat and exploring the whole world. I am working on a little one. I take online classes, am about to graduate, and have nothing really going on in my life. I could definitely use some new women friends or potentially a relationship with someone who is into alternative lifestyles. Even if you just wanna be friends and talk or whatever, please be single becasue I am afraid of messing up someone's relationship or getting harassed by some insane boyfriend in a wifebeater otherwise. I am pretty in shape and smoke pot often. Thank you for reading, and god bless you.

Whats up guys - I want to find a play buddy, someone to either play magic with in person or online (I use cockatrice). It can be as a group thing, or a casual one-one thing. I mostly play modern and legacy, but I haven't known anyone IRL who plays in a very long time.

That's it! Easy peasy. If you're looking for someone to play with, hit me up! If you're looking for someone to have casual sex with or some other random thing, you know, probably not. 

I've posted similar things in the past to no avail. If you write me, please be serious. I put up a photo of myself, don't make me regret it.

I'm a housewife (no kids, 3 cats, 2 fish, 1 husband) and while I can't say I'm ever bored during the day, it would be nice to have some female companionship sometimes. I'm not very good at saying, ""hey, let's ____"" so my potential friendships tend to die on the vine. I need someone who is good at making suggestions and thinking of things to do. Even if it's just sitting on the couch and crafting or staying home and baking or watching a movie. 

My hobbies are: crafting (mostly knit/crochet but I like all kinds of crafting - teach me something new!), gardening, shopping, I love road trips, eating at new places (though I'm a bit of a picky eater,) and trying new things. If you have a hobby that I haven't experienced, I'd love to try it! I'd especially love to try new things that get me outside more, but they have to be low impact and not hard on a troublesome hip. I would especially enjoy things in or on the water, or on horseback (but I don't have a horse.) But I'm game to try just about anything as long as it's legal(ish) and doesn't hurt.

My requirements for a friend aren't many. I don't really care about your age. You could be young enough to be my daughter and we'd have that kind of relationship. Or old enough to be my mother and yay for that. Or close to my age. You could have kids or not (just no unruly kids if they're going to spend much time with us, cuz... can I hit them? LOL) No smoking around me. I don't care your religion or political beliefs, in fact, I don't want to hear about them. Race is unimportant, sexual orientation is unimportant (just don't come on to me!) I'm not a fan of dogs, so if you have them I prefer they stay away from me. Across the room is fine, just don't jump on me, lick me, etc. Kitties on the other hand, should always be on me. :D If you're easily offended, move along because I'm easily offensive. 

If you're a man and think we'd make great friends, good luck with that. My husband is my best friend and he says I'm not allowed to date. 

I'm mostly looking for daytime weekday availability, but my husband is oncall every 3rd week (at least right now), and on his oncall weeks I'd be willing to leave him at home while I go do fun things without him. 

So tell me about you?

Hi all!
I just found out Parov Stelar is going to be here on Monday night, and being a fan, decided to go. Only thing is, I'd rather have some company when I go. The concert is on Monday, April 18th at 7:00 PM. Send me a message so we can chat a bit and make sure we're on the same wavelength.

About me... I'm 27, trans, fairly tall (5' 11""), a bit on the overweight side. Friendly, if a bit shy and introverted at times. A Parov Stelar fan obviously. Usually I'm into outdoorsey stuff, skiing, camping, hiking, rock climbing, etc. I read a lot. 420 friendly. Send me a pic and I'll send one back. I'm just not comfortable posting one directly on cl.

Hopefully we'll end up with a friend at the end of this that we can do other stuff together with. Age, gender, appearance, etc. don't matter to me.

Thanks for reading and talk to you soon!

I'm not sure if this is the right place to find what I'm looking for, however nothing ventured...nothing gained. Right?

Since moving to Seattle several years ago I still haven't found anyone whom I consider a true friend. I've made loads of acquaintances, and I have more than my share of fair weather friends but what I'm looking for is a REAL friend. I travel a lot for both work and pleasure and I'm looking for someone with a sense of adventure. 

I'm honest, down to earth and have a great sense of humor. I enjoy weekend trips, camping, hiking, being outside, travel, cooking. I'm a social drinker and 420 friendly if that matters. I'm straight but that doesn't matter. You can be bi, gay, straight whatever, just be real! If you are gay, I'd prefer if you were masculine. Not that's there's anything wrong with effeminate men, I'm just not very comfortable around them. No offense, I'm just being honest so I don't waste anyone's time. I'm in my late 40s but people often mistake me for being younger. I guess it's good genetics. Lol. I'm active, but could stand to loose a few pounds. Having a good friend to do things with will get me back out and moving. 

I'm not sure what else to write. So if you're looking for a real, honest, loyal friend or if you want to know more, please send me a message. All I ask is that you be REAL. I respect you enough to not to waste your time, please be as considerate to me. I'm only interested in PLATONIC relationships. If your looking for sex you've got the wrong guy!

I'd like to meet good people who live in Renton, south Seattle, Factoria, Newcastle, Kent and other areas within about a 15-mi. radius of Renton who are ~55 and up in age. Please be a reliable person who follows through after emailing, not so busy that you never can find time to socialize, and someone who plans to remain in the area. Thank you for reading the entire ad before replying to it with answers to the PLEASE NOTE paragraph below.

Are you looking for real, long-term, reliable friends rather than just acquaintances? I'm also ready to meet new friends closer to home who are kind and considerate to share good conversation and activities. How about you? Do you love nature and getting out into it? Art and music? Let's meet at a cafe for a conversation or get out for a park walk and chat on a good weather day and go from there.

People who are adventurous, will try new things and are curious about life in general are my favorite types of friends. My interests include almost anything that's outdoors in decent weather - good walks and hikes; having a good conversation; musical events; good movies, plants/gardening and public gardens; little road trips, and lifelong learning about all types of things including other cultures. Indoor pursuits like conversation over coffee, museums, dinner, talks, hearing music of many types and the like are great when the weather may not be cooperative. I'm hoping you share some of those interests and also want to meet someone who will share some of your unique interests and offers mutual support. I'm a non-smoker (you too, please) and occasionally have a wine or drink. We don't need any of this to have a good time, however. 

I'm a truly good person, have a sense of humor, and am a good friend who remembers birthdays, pays attention to what friends say, and tells them about news or activities I think will interest them. I'm also an empathetic person who will help friends in whatever way I can whenever I can. I'm intelligent, but not intellectual, have a spiritual side but am not religious. (No proselytizers, please) I'm reliable and look for other people who are too, as well as people who are kind, good people who have most of those qualities. Nobody is perfect, of course.

PLEASE NOTE: Please email and include where you are (city/neighborhood), a bit about your personality and interests, and days/time windows you're generally available to socialize. Please be close to the boomer age range and in the areas posted in the first paragraph above. If you'd like to send along your number in addition to a self-description to shortcut things, you can definitely trust me with it. 

If you're fit enough to get out for at least brisk walks, that would be great. I'm fairly fit for this age. I was born elsewhere, have been in the Northwest more than half a lifetime and have interest in meeting people from everywhere. If you're overly concerned with superficiality over substance, we very likely would not be compatible. Otherwise, I look forward to hearing from you soon! [Sorry, not looking to meet married people or couples. It doesn't generally work out that well.]

My close friends moved away to different parts of the country, and the ones in the area have been so busy with their own lives. I too have been kept busy with work and school, but things are beginning to settle, and I have a feeling that it would be nice to meet new people. Who does not like making new friends?

I am pretty open-minded, love movies, and I am getting back into reading regularly. I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree, where I'm an economics/philosophy/political science major. Running is something I am re-learning to do (I was previously an avid runner), and I am training for a couple 5Ks. I savor the experience of food, especially Thai, where I cannot resist a good plate of pad see ew or pad kee mao. I'm learning to cook and I like comic books, so I have a few geeky moments.

Looking for a serious workout partner! 

Hello my name is Dale I am 39 years old and looking for someone that is ready to be serious about getting in shape. The last 4 years of my life were very stressful leading me to gain an extra 40- 50lbs that I want to be rid of. 

I would like to find someone that is ready to commit to being each others support and keeping each other accountable for working out and eating well. Its going to be tough to do alone and hopefully you are as ready as I am to get healthy. I am a strong guy and not so out of shape that I can't do whatever I want. I was in great shape at one point in my life and very athletic. 

In three to four months we can be in the best shape we have been in years or do nothing and change nothing. Time will pass the same either way. I know I wish I had done this three months ago.

You must be:
-Positive 

-willing to work out in they morning early

-willing to stick to a good clean eating diet.

-ready to push through the hard days even when you want to quit.

-able to work out and keep up with workouts. 

-tell me to get off my ass if I seem lazy (I will do the same for you)

-ready to start ASAP. It does not have to be a Monday or the first of the month. We start now because today is the day we can change everything. 

-live in or near Puyallup

-possibly get a membership to the same gym

Thanks for reading this and I can't wait to get after it and get in shape!!

As the title says, I'm hoping to find fellow blood on the dance floor fans, specifically ones that are over the age of 16 and plan to go to their concert and VIP in Everett on June 13th. 

I am 20 years old and a guy, I have one friend in the state that I can actually see on a regular basis but she does not want to go with me because it is not her type of music. I'm an atheist, not religious and I prefer if you would be not religious either. I am OK if you like kids but prefer to be friends with people who don't want them because people have a tendency to choose kids over me and I don't want to go through that again. I'm vegan which means I don't consume or use any animal products or things tested on animals. No, I don't care what you eat. I really don't. 


I'm a furry, meaning I basically like anthropomorphic animals which is a big fancy word for animals that walk on two legs and have human characteristics such as facial structure, opposable thumbs and the ability to speak and walk and a human body build. 

I'm asexual, which means that I am not interested in anything sexual whatsoever. I do not like being physically touched as I am autistic but I can handle it. 

Please don't be a smoker, it smells nasty and I can't be around it. I'm sorry I just can't. I don't care if you smoke pot just don't smoking around me. I don't want to come home smelling like.

I do not have a particular style such as Gothic or what you would call emo, and I've definitely not scene.

As long as you're over 16, at your age does not matter to me. It would be nice to find some older fans of the band, please no rude messages or emails about how ""fuck that shit band"" or how you don't like them or think this and that about the bandmembers. Their music isn't for everybody and that's fine. If you don't like their music then cool. 

I take the bus everywhere and would like to meet you in person at least a couple times before the concert. I have a fursuit of my fursona, and I will be wearing it to the concert so the only thing is you would have to stay with me and close to me for the entire concert because I would need somebody to watch for signs of heat stroke or help me unzip the front of my cost you if I get overheated. You might think, why would you wear something that can cause heat stroke? Heatstroke can only occur if the area is not a well ventilated and if no one is paying attention for the signs of it. I will be drinking tons of water during this time. 

I love animals. I don't do any drugs and I don't drink although I don't have a problem with alcohol. Just not old enough to purchase it yet. I have a couple facial piercings and stretched ears. Please email me or just message me on Facebook, do not add me on Facebook if you do not intend to talk with me.

Facebook is dahvie hammons. And yes, that is my legal first name. No it is not because of the bandmember being named that. Not at all. 

No, I don't post pictures of myself online because I feel like taking selfie's is conceded and shows you are full of yourself. Probably not true but that's how I feel about taking pictures of myself. I will not send any type of sexual picture. I have no problem sending you a picture of my face through messages or meeting in person. 
Aside from that, I love dragons and foxes and coloring. I tried to draw but I don't have a whole lot of free time. I have autism and I am disabled but I can walk and everything just fine I don't use any equipment. I swear a lot and I'm very sarcastic. Most of the time I come off as being really rude but that's just how blunt I am.

I love love love the guinea pigs and rodents. I am an introvert and cannot handle having a lot of people socializing with me.

I placed this ad originally under Gigs/Talent, but because I'm not necessarily seeking an experienced model, I thought I'd also try here in SP:


HI,

I'm an experienced, well equipped photographer seeking an ongoing subject for lifestyle shoots.

I have a strong background in landscape and seascape. I've become strong at headshot portraits. I'm still working at developing my eye for lifestyle and environmental.

I'm looking for someone that genuinely enjoys being photographed and who wants to work together now and then in an ongoing arrangement of TFP. You'd get a lot of high-res, edited images with no rights restrictions; use them however you wish.

I need your time, energy and creative input.

With this being CL, I feel like I need to add that I do not shoot nudes or erotic. I am not ever interested in seeing you naked. I don't want to date you or hookup with you. 

This is a legitimate and honest attempt to find someone who enjoys being photographed, as much as I enjoy shooting and editing.

Ongoing is the key. I'd really like to find someone I can work and improve with longer term. I'm looking to develop that rapport that leads to much greater connection between camera and subject.

Lastly, this is not fashion modeling. You don't need to be perfect or any particular height/shape/shade. This is portrait work ... all sorts of looks and types can work for this.


The sample images are my work, shared with permission of the subjects.

I'm a 35 year old married healthcare professional, but I only get to see my wife on weekends because of our work schedules, so I'm looking for a friend I can hang out with after work, preferably near Seattle, although I can travel a little outside the city proper to meet you. I don't have any other specific requirements about the type of friend I'm looking for. I'm pretty open minded at this point, so you can just let me know what you like to do for fun. If you're into jogging, awesome, I could use a jogging partner other than my dog, but if you aren't, that's fine too. I would also be happy just to have a friend to meet in cafes, restaurants, or leisurely walks in the city. I also like all different genres of film, TV shows, music, singing, playing guitar, and all different kinds of tabletop and video games. We can even go shopping together. Unlike so many other guys, I'm actually into that. 

I know it sounds it's like I'm into pretty much everything, so just to prove I'm not a make believe friend, I'll mention the two major things I'm not so into: watching sports and going to bars...although I do enjoy wine and beer with dinner on occasion. Hope you all didn't stop reading right there. ;)

If my ad interests you, please respond with a little introduction about yourself and what you're looking for. If you just say ""hey, what's up"" you won't get a reply.

I'm willing to share a photo before we meet in real life, but I want to get to know a little about you and decide if there's a reasonable chance we could be friends first.

So straight to the point. I am a married guy. I love my wife very much. I have a happy home and do not want to change that at all. 

However, there is so much missing now. All the romance and great sex. The kisses and fun. I guess the years take their toll.

I refuse to be with a prostitute or with someone that gets around. 

I want to find someone that is in the same boat. That loves to have fun. That lives in pierce county. A huge plus if you live oral because that's my thing. 

Please be real because I am.

It would be nice for a long term but one time is fine.

These are 14 and 15 year old KIDS,and they play this song as well as any college orchestra of music majors that I've ever heard.

One request: Please don't flag:)

So, I have posted couple of times on CL offering a free massage.

I used to do this quite a bit earlier in another city (moved here 4 yrs ago) and I would easily find folks to trade massages with. If nothing, it'd be at least a one way massage. 

It was so strange - for both my ads, I got like one response...lol. 

Thought - I was doing something wrong so thought of seeking feedback. What would be a concern seeking a platonic massage through CL? 

I mean, Massages are fairly expensive so a free one should be interesting, right? As for safety, I first offer to meet in public, talk on phone and even keep the first massage as simple as possible - for example just arms or just neck. No full body or anything that'd make you uncomfortable with a stranger. I can also offer couple of references from my friends in NYC who I have done this with. Not once have I crossed the decency line. I'm a gentleman with a normal life, job, education etc. High hygiene and to those it matters, I look decent too.

Why I do it - its fun really. Meeting someone new and the possibility of finding a massage trading partner is awesome. I enjoy the touch - giving or receiving but have zero expectations beyond that. Relaxation and the chat and the idea of meeting someone new is just awesome!

Overall, its full transparency so wanted to know what could I still be missing in my offer?

Any and every feedback is welcome - feel free to just curse me too:) Even that is a feedback!

Im just looking for my bff. Im just going to lay it out. Im the shy, quiet type depending who I get around. I do better with one on one or small group settings. I am very 420, it's a plus if you were too. I love to dance, music of choice would be R&b and Spanish music. I am originally from NY and a Mom so must be good with children and like to be around them since mine aren't going anywhere lol. I am a very nature loving person meaning I love to camp, hike, and bonfire that sort of stuff. I just want to build a special connection with someone that I can call my BFF.

Just want a bud who isn't all about sex but on the other hand is open enough not to care if our penis touch. I used to have a friend like this in high school but i don't anymore and miss it. I consider myself blunt and funny that goes along with being blunt so if your easily offended I'm not your guy. However I wouldn't mind seeing pictures of your girl if you wanted and i love str8 porn. 

Sorry for the length. I'm discreet and you must be as well. So face pictures might take a few days. And i know we will not know if we click till we meet and hang out so put your best foot forward

Geez. Didn't think I would be on here and not sure what I'm looking for..

A friend and confidant would be nice.

I'm typically the one the everyone comes to for advice.
The level headed,logical thinker yet also empathetic to all situations..

I don't normally ask for assistance because frankly ,I havent needed it.

I guess we all reach a point in our life where we could use a confidant.

I just have alot on my mind and it would be nice to have someone to chat with..

Chat about life, love, our choices, our dreams,our proudest and not so proud moments.

A little about me if it matters
I'm basically a really awesome guy that happens to not go out much.
I'm an ambitious 29 yr old.
I work hard and am a damn good person.
I am extremely genuine and alot of ppl tell me I am a breath of fresh air.
They also say that I am not what they were expecting.
So I guess I should say that I am a breath of fresh air and I may not be what you are expecting haha


Either way I am looking for someone to chat with..
We can email, text, phone call, or if you are feeling bold enough we could meet for lunch or to have a drink.

I don't care what your marital status is.... single,attached, or its complicated.
Just be good company and be ready to talk and also ready to listen is all I ask.


Introduce yourself.
I look forward to meeting you:)

27 years old, originally from the Midwest, air force veteran, currently works for an airline.
About Her: 
26 years old, southern California native, grew up in Oregon, works in health care full time and is an online student. 

About Us: 
We love going to the theater and attending sporting events (Go Mariners! Go Seahawks!). In the summertime (or if we're feeling brave in the off season) you'll find us kayaking or paddle boarding, taking our two dogs on a hike or to one of the awesome dog parks seattle has to offer. She likes to snowboard but hasn't convinced him to get up to the mountain yet, so if there are any snowboarders out there, that would be awesome! We go out for the occasional happy hour, or dinner/movie dates but we're not super big partiers. Since neither of us are from here we don't have a tight knit group of friends like we're used to at home. And we're both aware that it's probably because we spend so much time together. So it would be nice to meet couple that we both get along with! If you think we'd get along, send us a picture and a little bit about yourself!

Look forward to hearing from you! :)

This might be a long shot. But I'm looking for someone who knows how to play a guitar and is interested in teaching me. I don't want to pay for lessons.

In exchange, you would gain a friend that . . . umm. . . well, crap, I don't have any real skills that I could teach you but I like to eat out and go drinking soooo, we could totally do that kind of thing and I could pay for a few rounds, etc.!

I'm 36, white male, married (by the way, this is about learning to play the guitar and having a friend, not stepping out on my wife) and reasonably attractive I have a little bit of a Dad-bod . . . but I don't have any kids . . . it's strictly the result of rigorous conditioning like running, self-loathing, trying to eat entire pizzas as some sort of personal challenge, more self-loathing, more running, that kind of thing. 

I'm only mentioning this because people pretend that looks don't matter, but come on, they totally matter, and nobody wants to teach an ugly guy to play guitar, especially if they're just getting paid in beer and food . . . well, whisky and really good food. But you get the idea.

Hello,

I am a 26 year old pretentious film douche and I greatly enjoy going out to the cinema to see many movies, but most especially classic movies. Every week I go see a new classic movie at the cinema (this week is DAZED AND CONFUSED and then the next week is, I think, A STAR IS BORN).

Anyway, I have friends but I don't really have any good pretentious film douche friends around who want to go out to the movies and then talk about cinema together. Mostly they wanna go see shitty new movies like whatever nonsense garbage superhero stuff is currently playing (I hear that new BATMAN movie is really and truly awful). So basically I'm looking for someone who gets a boner for a good cinematic experience. If you are like me and believe that movies are meant to be seen in the theater and that playing with your phone during a movie (even if you're watching the movie at home) is just truly and utterly wrong and completely disrespectful to the art of film, then we may get along!

About me. I am Brett, aged 26, a lovely young gay man. I am sweet and kind but also sarcastic and, hopefully, funny (people tell me so). I would love a person who is in my age bracket (let's just say 18 to 30) and preferably also gay, not necessarily so that we can have sex, but just cuz we would have something to talk about, what with the whole being gay and loving penises subject. I'll see about attaching a pic of myself below so you have some idea of who you're dealing with before you message me. Also, please attach a picture of yourself in the E-Mail right away just so I know you're not some fat, bald, white, ugly, creepy middle aged dude who is going to try and molest me. No photo in E-Mail means I will not respond to you.

Also, my very last request, PLEASE don't do the thing where it takes FOREVER to meet up and we exhange a thousand E-Mails and go back and forth for 17 years and then just end up not hanging out at all. If you wanna hang, E-Mail me, we'll see if we get along, we'll hang out together, and if we don't have fun, who cares? No hard feelings and we don't have to continue hanging out if we don't like eachother.

Thanks for reading!

I'm in my early 40s, work in the technology sector, have a car, I don't smoke, use any drugs, although I like to drink socially. I have one grown daughter who doesn't live with me.

I would like to meet a single female, that means not married, not dating. I don't want the drama of a jealous boyfriend/husband.

Non smoker, no pot or any street drugs, and no little kids. By that I mean, old enough to do their own thing, no babysitter, they have their own life.

I'm open to many things. Farmers markets, swimming, outdoor events, taking a walk, window shopping, going out for some drinks, having dinner, and plenty more. However, I don't want to go see a movie anytime soon because the purpose of getting together is to talk and get to know each other, and a movie does not work for that.

Someone who is available fairly regularly. Not necessarily daily, but at least once a week or two.

Not looking for sex or one night stands. If you are, or are into that, please don't reply.

This purpose of this ad isn't to find a relationship, rather someone to spend time with. I'm not against relationships at all, and I would like to have one at some point, but that is not my goal right now.

Material items don't matter to me. I never liked those who have to flaunt what they have. I like down to earth, realistic people who just appreciate others and are respectful.

I would like to meet someone who will make effort to stay in touch. Doesn't matter if we call, text, email, but I do expect effort on both sides.

If you like what you have read so far, please write back and tell me about yourself. One sentence, quick replies like ""hey how are you? let's talk"" are deleted. No effort was made.

I'm looking for someone/people to go on adventures with!

Why am I posting on here? Well the answer is a two parter. 
1. My current friends are shut one and I'm someone who loves being out and about. 
2. I'm also shy when meeting people. Once the shyness subsides, I think people are off-put by my personality (Which is a cross between geek and preppy) 

I love to go on hikes, watch movies, explore new places, try new things (all of the cliche NW acrivities). I also love card and board games, video games and absolutely love reading. Im also a very easy going relaxed person. It also takes almost no effort to amuse me when I'm hanging out with people. 

It would be nice to hang out with people who share a couple common interests with me and hopefully will turn in to a great friendship ^_^

Drop me a line! If you're someone who needs a picture, yours gets mine.

It's such a nice day out today I don't want to waste it just sitting at home doing chores or being a couch potato so I'm looking for someone to go mushroom hunting with. Morels are starting to pop up all over and while I'm not sure any spots around here(I do in Cle Elum) I figure why not have a go and trying. I live in south Seattle but willing to meet up anywhere really. 

I'm 36,sane,have a job,share a house with roommates,entrepreneurial,adventurous,like exploring hole in the wall restaurants,anything to do with the water,camping,fishing,hunting,hanging out with friends,traveling and many other interest.

I have pics if it matters but let get out and explore the area and enjoy the sun!

It's April 17, 2016, almost 1:30 pm, and it's a gorgeous day outside! I want to get out and do something! Fun, action-packed, relaxing... I really don't care!

So here's the thing: I am trying to get out into the world as much as possible. My close friends moved away to different parts of the country, and the ones in the area have been so busy with their own lives. I too have been kept busy with work and school, but things are beginning to settle, and I have a feeling that it would be nice to meet new people. Who does not like making new friends?

I am pretty open-minded, love movies, and I am getting back into reading regularly. I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree, where I'm an economics/philosophy/political science major. Running is something I am re-learning to do (I was previously an avid runner), and I am training for a couple 5Ks. I savor the experience of food, especially Thai, where I cannot resist a good plate of pad see ew or pad kee mao. I'm learning to cook and I like comic books, so I have a few geeky moments.

I enjoy witty banter, have hobbies, and genuinely ask questions, so conversation will never be short.

I drink socially and frequently smoke a little pot. My interests are wide and varied and I'm always interested in exploring new things. Currently my time is taken up by remodeling projects on my new home. I'm very handy. I also enjoy gardening/yard work. For fun I have a light motorcycle that I cruise on as well as a 4x4 pickup that I like to take into the mountains to explore the logging roads. Last weekend I went to the seashore for the first time in years. I'm looking forward to doing some camping this summer. I love anything on or around the water and have some little sailing experience. I'd love to accompany you on your boat. Eventually I'll have my own! Today I'm unloading a bunch of potted plants from my truck and then hopping on my motorcycle to visit Titlow Beach and maybe stop at Steamers Seafood Cafe for lunch. It's gonna be lonely though!

Hello, thanks for stopping by. I'm a 46 yr old male looking for a female friendship, I don't care if you're single or married, skinny, thick, bbw, white, black, purple, alien or other. What I care about is personality.

Do you have a sense of humor, can you take a ribbing as well as give one? Are you open minded? Do you look at things and try to see the best?

I'm married and I've been with the same woman for the last 12 years. I'm not looking to change that, as I love her deeply, but the passion is gone, the dog gets more attention than I do. I miss that spark, that feeling when you look into each others eyes and the butterflies.

I want to start losing weight again and getting back into shape. I started a couple of years ago and was doing well, but after a knee injury, I slid back the other way. I live near Silver Lake and I've been thinking it would be nice to start walking around the lake again several times a week or even daily. It would be nice to have a companion to accompany me and perhaps we can get in shape together. It would also be nice to hang out once in awhile and watch a movie or just sit and talk. I'm currently self-employed and I'm flexible in my schedule, but most often have free time during the weekdays from 9:30 to 3:00 and occasionally on weekends.

I'd like a friendship where she understands my situation, perhaps is in the same. Someone who isn't looking to change my situation or me hers. If more develops beyond just friends, I'm not opposed, but I'm also not expecting. Friendship is really the more important factor, anything else is icing. I tried this several months back and met a couple of nice people, but one had opposing schedules, one got close to me and then apparently got old feet and suddenly disappeared and one, who I thought was great after awhile admitted she didn't like kids and my son is everything to me. So no luck before, I'm trying once again as it's getting nice outside. 

So if you've made it this far, why not say hello. Perhaps we can chat a bit by email or kik and go from there. Please don't ask for a picture unless you're willing to send one as well, as I said personality is more important to me than looks. One can be a model, but if their personality sucks, they're going to be ugly in my eyes.

I'm getting a lot of spam/scam, so please change the subject to Cultured Pearl, so I know it's a genuine response. Hope to hear from you soon.

Hey There :)

Like they say - Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars

First off, I'm married and started wondering recently what else might be out there. While I have no intention of leaving, it would be fun to meet someone in a similar situation--wondering what it's like on the other side of the fence - the passion, the personality, and feelings. Maybe some excitement, intrigue, suspense, and the feel of our beating hearts. I'm looking for someone to teach me something new about life. Bonus points if you've kept your body fit, mind young, imagination alive, and face smiling. I love woman of all ages - so please don't be bashful about being either older or younger. Try me :-)

No drama required, a healthy drive for passion is mutual,...... All within the confines of just the two of us knowing. My description of the perfect affair partner is someone that is married, is attractive, has a sense of humor, and is intelligent.

I'm very fit and attractive, the discreet nature of the post is why I haven't put a picture. Once we have chatted a little more I'd be happy to exchange. I'm a business professional, well educated and very stable financially.

I want a woman that will stick around for a while. If you do, I promise I'll give you plenty in return! If you meet have the above qualities, I'd love to hear from you.

I am a recently divorced father of 2 amazing little girls. I am in a journey to see the world, to talk to people, to find myself in hopes of healing from my wife leaving me and throwing life into a tail spin. I'm looking for someone who might want to host me for a few days. Maybe have a couch to crash on and maybe want to show me around the city and see all sights. In return I can pay for all entertainment, dinners etc. I am moth looking for anything creepy, I just want to see the world on a reasonable budget and make some friends on the way. I'm not concerned with what you look like, I just want a nice person who can carry a conversation, who isn't crazy or angry at the world. If you believe in God and try to lead a good life even better. 40 yo normal male here from the Midwest.

It's currently really late Saturday night, or more accurately it's really early sunday morning. Saturday was long, and nothing went according to plan. Its been a really really long night, and I can't sleep. I'm tired of trying. According to Google maps, I'm 19 minutes away from the Muck. I should forewarn you, I'm not some cheap floozy that's gonna go down on someone within two minutes of meeting them. Sorry, I'm just not that type, I like to hang out for a couple hours at least, have a few drinks, bullshit for awhile n get to know the person. Personally if I'm gonna get laid, I don't want the sex to be cold and boring. I want it to to be hot and passionate, and fun ya know? And in order for that to be possible, I have to get to know the guy first. So here's my plan for us; you come pick me up(I don't drive) and we head to the muckleshoot to have a few drinks and get to know each other while we gamble (and hopefully win some money) and then once we are (or just me, if you don't drink, or if you dont drink and drive, you don't have to, it's not a deal breaker if you don't drink lol) thoroughly intoxicated, we can bounce out and go have some fun.

So I'm from Houston, TX ... Still living down South. I do plan to relocate to Seattle within the next year or so. Was just there in March for my Spring Break (Had a Blast) ..Can't wait to visit again.
Anyway, I'm looking for something long term and SERIOUS. The guy I currently love isn't wanting anything that I want. He's an amazing person. I hate moving forward, but honestly I'm TIRED of hurting inside. I want marriage and a baby ... With him being older than me. He's been through that life style I guess you can say.. And he isn't wanting to have anything serious soon:( I keep hanging on .. Thinking maybe things will change.. But he have said it himself nothing will change. Like I said he's an amazing guy, we're just in different spots in our lives... And in all honesty my heart is giving up... So I'm looking into getting to know someone... Even if we are friends that's cool. 
A little about me.. African American. I'm in school studying Criminal Justice. I work long shifts on the weekends as a Security Officer while in school. I have a Lab Mix Pup. Well he'll be 1 in June 🐶😊. The reason for my wanting and will be relocating is because I was a foster child. I was taken from my parents very young. And as an adult now... I don't have any immediate family here...& Houston is all I know. I'm not married or don't have kiddos.. So I figured why not, right? 
You should be a NONCRIMINAL and drug free that's really important to me. I don't like marijuana and don't care to be around it either. I do drink... (Funny when I was there in Seattle, I noticed for some reason ""Margaritas"" aren't as popular up there haha) like it is here in Houston..
I prefer you to be Caucasian....No Foreign Men.... Sorry just what I'm interested in. With a good build. Please not tooooooo skinny/slim or chunky. Attached some pictures and introduce yourself. I will mention this... I do judge off the first message. Intelligence catches my attention.. Someone that can carry a conversation without an issue... No thugs please. Or tattooed covered men... If you do not PROPERLY introduce yourself along with pics...I will not reply.
Age preference uhm.. 21 to maybe 35 ... Please no one older than 45.

I'm kinda of embarrassed to be posting here but whatever. I realized that I am at a different point in my life then most of my friends. I love them dearly but we have different priorities, which has left me kinda lonely I guess.

I am a very open minded and down to earth kind of person, who can get along with just about anyone. A lot of people think I'm really rude at first because I'm shy and opinionated all at the same time. I value friendship a lot. There is nothing worse then someone playing nice to your face but a total twat behind your back. 

I have two kids 4 and 6, a full time job, a house, cars and a fiancĂŠ. I work hard for what I have. I am not the type of person who wants to go party all the time. I'm content drinking a few beers at home while watching a movie or having fire. But I do like going out to concerts and things like that. I like all types of music. My favorite movies are suspense and thriller movies. I guess you could say I'm kind of a tom boy. I like doing art and craft type stuff. I am not very good at it but I like trying. 



I know my chances of finding someone on here are slim, but I'm hoping to find someone!

I'm looking for fun companionship with shared responsibilities ... we are in it together. You can join here or there for a day or whatever else works out for us. The schedule isn't necessarily set in concrete and have no place in Whistler yet (happy to homesit or take care of things as needed). I'm not guiding anything (even though I could!?) and above average fitness level and skills in ski-moutainieering/skiing might be beneficial. That said, I'll compromise somewhat to make things work out OK ... that's the goal.
3) In case you are interested but wondering: yes, I have the best wife there is and she actually suggested that I might have more fun with a companion than on my own. She is unavailable and knows that I love sharing good times with someone who treasures the moment and the now as much as I do ... that said and with the obvious that good sex is great, that is not even near the top of the list of ""action"" I'm looking for. Let's enjoy the magnificent outdoors and maybe have some fun conversation for a drink (i.e., apres ski) ... BTW, aside from sports I enjoy science, aviation, travels, cultures, cuisines, etc. just to mention a few.
If you are interested, please share a little about yourself and why, when, how, etc. you might be able to join and provide at least a first name, picture and phone number. I'll return the favor and we can take it from there .... Berg Heil

Hi! 

I have actually reached out a few times with no real success. So, here goes. 

I don't think CL is a good medium for starting conversation with someone, but maybe you could prove me wrong. 

Before you spend too much time reading my post - let me tell you why you may NOT be interested. 

1. I have a boyfriend. 
- This means I won't be able to meet up or call you, just email and text only. 
2. I don't want to give out my picture! 
- I want to just talk to someone and since we may never meet, it shouldn't be that big of a deal what I look like. Maybe you will eventually coax me into sending you one, but it definitely won't be right up front. I left a general description below. If you absolutely must have attractive texting friends, you probably shouldn't message me. 
3. I work 8-5, M-F. 
- I don't have the luxury of texting all day while I'm at work, but after work and during lunch I'm usually available. Sometimes delayed. 

So, if you are still reading, here is why you SHOULD message me:

1. I don't care how old or young you are. 
- If you are fun to talk to, and we can relate on at least some points, and can be respectful of each other's differences, I don't care much about your age. 
2. I don't care how black or white or Hispanic or any-race you are. 
- See #1.
3. I don't care how married or single or divorced or separated or ""complicated"" you are. 
- As long as your significant other, if you have one, either knows what you are doing, won't find out what you are doing, or won't care if they did find out. I don't want to cause any relationship issues. 
4. I'm not easily offended by most topics. 
- ""Most"". 
5. I don't mind a bit of perviness or sarcasm. 
- As long as you aren't a total jerk, or making the conversation entirely sexual, or trying to ultimately get me to sext with you, I generally won't mind. 
6. I am naturally quite curious. 
- Even if I know nothing about the things you are interested in, I will have questions (provided you don't mind answering). 

If you're still here, this is what I want from you:

1. Be fun. 
- I don't mind at all if you have problems, I'm more than willing to listen and be a friend from the get go. But I deal with depression myself so I have to be careful too. If you have social anxiety or are socially awkward though, I would be very interested to talk about it and learn more about you. 
2. Be interesting. 
- You don't have to lead an interesting life to be an interesting person. Just have some thoughts in your head! 
3. Be at least somewhat intelligent. 
- See #2. I don't care if you are well educated or not, as long as you have some thoughts in your head to share. 
4. Be able to carry on a conversation! 
- This! Please limit your one word responses. If you are busy, fine. Sometimes I can only get out one or two words myself. But generally, I like to just talk back and forth. Maybe I don't ask you about yourself, but you just tell me things about you. I will tell you things about me, too. Too much Q&A gets boring and unoriginal. I want to hear your thoughts, your stories, your perspective on life. Tell me something deep, or something really silly. I like both, so ideally you will be serious sometimes and silly other times. But, even my seriousness is usually laced with a touch of humor. 

Here is the final thing you should know about me, if you have made it all this way. Real friendships CAN be made via chats and emails. I have friends who I have ""known"" for over 15 years, that I have only ever chatted with, and I have made real life friends who started as mere chatting. I would love to make a REAL friend, who I could talk to about work, or listen to about their day. We could exchange relationship stories, life experiences, dreams, goals, anything! Once life becomes a routine, it gets unexciting and predictable. You don't have to be exciting, just be willing to share interesting details and mundane ones alike. 

What did you have for dinner? What did you hope to become when you were younger? What did that customer do to you recently that really made your day notable? What interests you most about your significant other - or generally about women if you are single? Have an embarrassing story? Did something happen when you were young that shaped your life as you grew up? 

If you have made it this far, you really need to message me. 

Email is fine, at least starting out, but alternatively I have Kik, WhatsApp, and regular texting. Sort of prefer Kik or WhatsApp but I will do whatever. 

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Hello, Everyone...We are a middle-aged (51 & 55), long-term (22 years) gay couple who, like so many other people, are in a middle-age crisis. I am/have been steadily employed for years, but my partner is currently having employment troubles. He is working part-time (making more per hour than I do full-time) but not in his field of expertise. Unfortunately, we have to short-sell our dream home of 10 years in Kingston because of this. We need a solution, quickly. I believe we have about 120 days before we must leave this home. We have two dogs (one three years old, one 11 years old), both weighing in the 50-60lb range. They are lovers, but can bark at strangers, like any faithful companion. Ideally, we would like to find a small home/cottage/cabin/in-law/guest house/mobile/manufactured (1 bed/bath) with small fenced yard for the ""kids"" in the North or Central Kitsap area. Second choice, would be an apt allowing pets our size or a shared home situation. Maybe even another gay couple looking to ease their expenses? We are a quiet family, love to cook and bake. I've been trying to save money to get a ""cottage food"" license but that is on-hold for now, responsible and dependable. We have two vehicles but no payments. We are conservative with utilities, willing to help with yard work, etc. We can afford up to $1000/month out of my salary. I am employed at the Oak Table CafĂŠ in Silverdale (formerly in Kingston). This is a legitimate call for help for good people who are in desperate need. Not as desperate as some, but...it's so scary to be this age and in this situation. Even if you personally don't have something to rent or are looking to reduce your expenses in a shared house situation, maybe you know someone who is open to the idea. Thank you for your time.

Hi I'm Wayne a licensed cosmetologist looking to expand on my skill set. Now I've been licensed and practicing for 8+ years now and every so often we in the beauty industry need to refresh our skills. So to the point. I'm looking to do more manscaping/waxing services. Specifically Brazilians also know as ""Brozilian"", ""Manzilian"", ""Boyzilian"" etc. This service normally runs at a starting price of $45 for a partial (just the front area) and $65 for a full (everything). Because you'd be helping me out I ask a starting price of $30. And that's just to cover the wax and travel (gas is getting up there again). I also offer hair removal for other areas(back, shoulders, arms, legs, chest, etc) This is completely on the level and sanitary. I come equipt with a table and manscaping waxing instrument. I'm mobile so the services are performed in the privacy of your home. This is good for anyone that's ever wanted to try but didn't know who or how to ask about a services like this, your looking to get cleaned up for the warmer months, looking for a new manscaping/waxing specialist, or just felt awkward/nervous about going to a salon and talking to someone about this. If you have any questions feel free to ask there is no judgment and not only are you helping me but you're helping yourself.

Hello,

Tech. I'm looking for friends either in Tacoma area or Seattle, Everett, and federal way. I go to federal way at least 4 times a week for my job. I live in Spokane so I'm over here during those 4 days bc of my job. I am a lesbian with a partner. We have 3 pit-mixes and no kids. Sometime we go on motor cycle rides w other ppl we have met I'm 42 and she is 49. We are down to earth and don't care for drama. We dnt care if ur straight,bi lesbian, tran. We dnt judge or care what ur race and sexual preference is. We are just looking to meet or even txt and email back in forth for friends only. We do like to go on road trips when I'm not wrking lol. Or like a mini vacation. My partner is a stay at home kinda of person bc of her health issues, meaning she isn't wrking. You can ask anything and I'll answere. Well I'm just giving this a shot.

Have a good day/evening or what ever the day brings you.

Hi I'm a married mother in her early 20s. i have 3 kids under 7 and I don't know many people in this area and its been hard for me to meet new people. I guess I just feel like an outcast among mothers once they find out how old i am, given I had my first child at 18. I kind of feel like other moms who are older look at me like I must not be a good mother because of my age and amount of children. I'm in a weird spot as most people my age dont have kids, or are becoming first time moms. 
So i guess i am just seeking friends who are accepting of me as a responsible younger mother. My typical day involves trips to the park, arts and crafts, reading books, taking the kids to sports and once they are asleep working on my own homework (I am also a college student) ... During my free time (typically weekends only) I enjoy movies, hiking, going to the gym, singing and music, shopping and wine. 
Alright. that is all :)

Hey Rihanna fans,

My name is Nicole and it's my 25th birthday on April 21st. Rihanna is going to be at the Key Arena on the 24th and I really want to go see her but none of my family or friends like her or can't get work off. 
I feel I must see her before I die and now seems like a good time so that's what this ad is all about.

I don't care if you're male/female, feminine/masculine, a dog or cat lover, eat mushrooms (ew) as long as you want to have a good time and like Rihanna! Alcohol and weed may be involved...I mean it's a Rihanna concert. :P

I haven't bought my ticket yet and I won't buy your ticket for you so theoretically you could invite your SO or friend too. I just don't want to go alone. The tickets I'm looking at are Lower 128 Row 5 for $202 but I'm willing to pay a little less or a little more.

I think it would be wise to meet beforehand so I can make sure you're not insane and or a murderer (my parents will worry less) and you can make sure I'm not completely crazy too.

If interested just email me.

The closest approximation to what I am seeking would be someone willing to share and process thoughts with me. The average persom has hundreds, if not thousands of thoughts a day, and many of them are mundane or routine, but every once in a while an idea or realization pops up that you take the time and think through but would love another perspective on it, to further round out your thoughts... but then everyone around you is so caught up in life, facebook, twitter, or even worse simply lacking the intellectual framework to understand.

If you've started sharing thoughts important to you, had your counterpart's eyes gloss over or immediately follow your thought with irrefutable proof of their complete lack of understanding, then you, too, understand how frustrating it is.

So in short, I am seeking a thought partner. 
My requirements are as follows:

- A modicum of ambition
- a desire to learn/an open mind
- an above average usage of intelligence, (We all know people with intelligence who fail to utilize it)
- A degree of mastery over the english language sufficient to communicate thoughts effectively
- Time and willingness to communicate (because talking once a month just isn't enough)

I hope to grow from knowing you and to facilitate your growth in return. I do not view age or any other demographic as a limiting factor for mental acuity.

I am not in the area, but that should not be a major factor in what i seek. Thank you. Hope to hear from you soon.

Life has been crazy for me. I spent the last decade treading water in the most uncomfortable lake amidst a brutal and unrelenting storm. Much of it was my own undoing, I'll admit.
Eventually I learned a bit about swimming, and managed to work my way to shore. The clouds are clearing now, and as the sun beats down upon my battered body, I look around and notice so much has changed. The people I knew have come and gone, their memories cutting deeper than any blade. I'm haunted, not only by my regret, but by the hollowness that's become my soul.

Things are different, now. A new place, a new start. Yet the tragic loneliness is enough to choke out even the toughest of humans. Although I appreciate solitude and shy away from most human contact, I still crave compatible companionship. So if anything you see here intrigues you, please, drop me a line.

I'm a tall, average human with a passion for animals, music, travel and writing. And although I can be considered eccentric and humorous, I'm an outstandingly sensitive and compassionate hopeless romantic.

I'm seeking anyone willing to chat and talk about anything deeply intellectual or rediculously silly. I'm looking to make a decent friend out here since I don't know many people outside my job, which I've just recently started. I don't care what you look like, what age you are, if you're fat, thin, round or square. All I ask is that you be as openminded and curious as me. 
Shoot me an email with your favorite animal as the subject.
Have a fantastic Sunday.

I'm what they call a sleep cuddler; I start searching around the bed for something the cuddle when I'm DEAD asleep. I'm very warm, so you wont get cold. If theres not a gypsy girl there, I will probably find a pillow... Never as good. you know?

Hi there!

I'm looking for someone to help me lose weight and keep it off. I need to be held accountable, and I need support, and I want to be that person for you as well.

I've been extremely overweight my entire life, and I think it's time to get off the couch and really make changes in my life. I'm 23, 5'4, and I weigh somewhere around 340 pounds. Ideally, my end goal is to be around 160-190 pounds, but to get there I need help.

I have a car so I'm pretty mobile and I spend most of my time between Kenmore and Lakewood so really I could probably meet up anywhere between those areas. I have a gym membership with Planet Fitness too (I do get a plus one, to any location). 

It would be cool to find someone that will be the rock I need, and I want to return the favor! 

I'm on a lot of social media, so whatever form of communication works for you will probably work for me, haha! I look forward to hearing from you :)

I would like to meet a woman that is easy to talk to, has no problem dealing with a smartass (that's me!), and agrees that this should be a mutual relationship -- we both please each other.

I may or may not sleep with a woman on the first date. I'd like to get to know you over a couple of drinks to see if we click on both an emotional and physical level. I'm not shallow, but I do need to be attracted to my partner. My description of the perfect affair partner is someone that is married (absolute MUST), is attractive, has a sense of humor, and is intelligent.

I'm very fit and attractive, the discreet nature of the post is why I haven't put a picture. Once we have chatted a little more I'd be happy to exchange. I'm in shape, take care of my body, caucasian, well educated and very stable financially.

My marriage is very boring, although I do love my wife. I need a little spice in my life. I'm not looking for a one-night stand. I could go out to a bar to find that. I want a woman that will stick around for a while. If you do, I promise I'll give you plenty in return! If you meet have the above qualities, I'd love to hear from you.

Intelligent, educated, professional, WM with a truly wicked sense of humor and a flair for the erotic, seeks an e-buddy to build synergy and to resonate with.

I get bored as hell at work because I do the same thing over and over. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me out of the loony bin is chatting it up...texting, email, IM, talking on the phone...Hell it could be smoke signals (no, not THAT kind of smoke), carrier pigeons, or bongo drums and I'd still enjoy it. 

What I'm looking for is to make a connection...To have that spark happen when intelligent conversation and flirting are mixed together with the rush of meeting somebody new. BOOM! Explosive?...Oh hell yes! I love it!

So then what happens, you ask. Well, I'm separated and I'm definitely not looking to change anybody's situation while I figure out mine. I'm really not expecting that we hook up, date, or even meet for an ice cream sundae at a church social (I've never done it in a church, lol...Have you?). At the end of the day, I'm just hoping to find a gal pal who both enjoys some male attention and giving a guy that same attention. Anything beyond that...let's cross that bridge if we ever get to it.

So let's talk about you: A woman (sorry guys, nothing personal, I just don't swing that way), 40-60 (the age is just a suggestion because we're likely to have more in common...but if you're under 40 or over 60 and you think you're up for the challenge, then by all means). Race, looks, religion, occupation, politics, astrological sign, blood type, favorite football team, etc etc are unimportant. Marital status...that's an interesting one. I prefer you to be married or divorced...But, as with the age, if you think you're up for it, then by all means. 

Turn On's:
A.) A woman who has a sense of humor as warped and irreverent as mine (You can laugh at almost anything). 

B.) A woman who doesn't need me to carry the conversation all the time (aka isn't afraid to speak her mind). 

C.) A woman with something going on upstairs (aka you know what synergy and resonance mean...or at least you're motivated enough to crack the dictionary).

D.) You're a fan of flirting and being flirted with. If you DON'T, let's not waste each others time.

Turn Off's:
A:) If you're somebody who thinks that bored people are boring, then carry your ass, sister. You're probably a princess and I don't need the headache.

B.) Likewise if you're going to be offended by my self confidence and think it's arrogance or conceit. If that's offensive or threatening, keep moving. There's plenty of gals who like self confidence in a man.

C.) Ditto on preaching about morality. If I want a lecture, I'll go to the aforementioned church and try that ice cream sundae.

D.) Nit Pickers. See A, Princess types for details. I'm not here to try and fix what's wrong with anybody and I sure don't need somebody doing it to me.

The rest of you gals, crack that dictionary, look up synergy, and drop me a line ;)

Just like the title says, I don't want to spend another summer sulking in my apartment because I don't have any friends to do things with. 

About me:
Transgender ftm
Male
20 
No kids (don't care for them)
Non smoker
No drugs but I'm 420 friendly I just don't use
Rides the bus everywhere
Vegan
Rodent lover
Virgo
Asexual

Since I take the bus everywhere, I'm not able to get to as many places as I would like. But, I would really like to just go out and do fun things this summer with someone. Not looking for any type of romantic relationship or sex. Just a strictly platonic relationship and if that develops into something more then we will cross that bridge when we come to it. 

I am disabled but I am completely ambulatory I don't have trouble walking. I like nature, going swimming and horses. Being vegan, I don't ride horses but I love just being around them and enjoying their company. 

I would love to go swimming at the beach or a lake in the evenings of summer, maybe even go picking berries or exploring, or just sit at home and do crafty things. I'm not an extremely crafty person but I think it would be fun to learn. 

I am not much of a kid person, but I would be able to tolerate it if you have teenagers. Age doesn't matter as long as you are a person who goes through with what you say and doesn't flake at the last minute. 

I am also autistic and I do not like physically being touched, it's nothing against the person I have sensory issues and being touched even a handshake can make me uncomfortable. I am not able to be around people who smoke, so please if you are a smoker then MoveOn. 

I love cleaning and organizing and I love love love rodents. I know most people don't like them but they are very sweet and clean. I also love all animals including dogs and cats and horses and cows. 

I'm on Social Security so unfortunately I do not have very much money to spare. I will be going through a pretty massive surgery potentially in July or August, so after that I may not be able to do as much. 

I'm just tired of spending every summer depressed in my apartment or my room like I have done since I was 11 because I didn't have any friends. I have friends but they are not in Washington. The one friend I do have who is near me cannot go swimming or hiking or walking or berry picking because she has trouble walking, so I cannot do very much with her. 

Please no overly religious people. I don't care if you are religious but let's just not talk about it because I'm an atheist and religion tends to cause unnecessary arguments. Trump supporters need not reply to this ad.

Hello,

So thanks for stopping by and reading my posting , I'll keep this short and simple. I'm seeking someone that has minimal drama in their life. Likes to have fun without pressures of wondering if we are getting along at every moment. So, if you route for the under dog or dislike standing in long lines when all you have is one item. You look in the mirror each morning and think wow where did that wrinkle come from then We should be laughing and joking about some corky stuff.

I'm just a down to earth guy in his 40s, four out five psychiatrist say I'm sane ""with meds"" oh and one of them is my cousin. I don't get asked out on dates but for some reason I do on April 1st it's so random! Remember this calling in sick is so much more fun if you you call a company you don't even work for!

I have a wine tasting/fundraiser to attend Saturday April 23rd at a home in the Highlands: a gated community in Shoreline. If you are a woman who is comfortable in a setting where you do not know anyone, enjoys fine wine and food...and does not mind hanging out with people interested in fundraising for an organization called Young Life, I would love to meet you this week and perhaps escort you to a fabulous night of fun, food and wine. I suppose the age range I would be most comfortable with is late 40's-late 50's...and a woman who is HWP.
As for me, I am 61, 5'10"" tall and weigh 155 lbs. I am not sure I will know anyone at this function myself but I do have an 18 year old daughter who has worked with Special Olympics kids through the Young Life Copernium program...which is how I received an invite to this shindig myself. 
So if you are feeling adventurous and desire to spend an evening with a man who is not going to try to get into your pants...just wants to enjoy an evening out with a beautiful woman...this may be your opportunity!

I thinks it's funny to look at all the postings of single desperate men on cl. So I came by this add of a very shallow man. I responded to him and he responded in a manner that produces how shallow he is. I took a screen shot of the email he sent me. I dont need to find a man on cl I just wanted a good laugh and got one lol.If there are any real men out there please show this 40 year old boy how to treat woman thank you. The following is the add he posted on cl titled are their any good looking woman on here:""I've been posting on here for some time now, and most of the women that reply are big
+ sized'', or just all around ugly'', I don't know what the deal is up here in the northwest,
what are all the women doing, sitting around and eating all day, or what''.
I post something on here, and 90% of the women that send me a pic are big.
I just don't get it, is craigslist the place for big women to hang out or what.
Now wen ever I do meet a nice looking woman on here, and I send my pic back,
I never hear from them anymore, so I must be ugly too.
It's just funny how ugly doesn't like ugly'',
I look for women that are more on the pleasant looking side,
I also in joy talking to younger women too, but there must be something about my age.
I don't think I'm old be any means, but the younger women don't want anything to do with me.
O'', by the way, I'm only looking for friends, low drama, pleasant looking, a little extra pounds is ok,
just don't be BBW'', I can click with big women, I just don't want to be friends with them.
I don't know why I feel that way, it's just how I feel, sorry to all the big people out there .
But at the same time I've been told I go after homely women, and just pleasant looking people,
and why don't I just try a little harder for a good looking women,
I don't know why, I just like pleasant looking people''
So that's my post for today, I'm not trying to piss anyone off, I'm just pointing out my feelings.""

We are a couple in our early 40's, no children at home. We are looking for friends in our age group who also have no children at home and enjoy the same things as we do.

We are very laid back and casual, easygoing, fun loving, spontaneous and are 420 friendly also.

We enjoy long drives, trips to the River, watching movies, shooting pool, Outdoor BBQ's and especially playing card and board games, such as: Cards Against Humanity, Uno, Skip-Bo, Yahtzee, Scrabble, Texas Hold'em and the like...

We have been together 4 years and we have younger ""couple"" friends, but they have school age children that can sometimes make a spontaneous event problematic (sitters, etc) .

We own our own Condo in South Hill, Puyallup and there really aren't too many places to go to meet ""friends"" nowadays, so we thought we'd give this a try.

We'd love to hear from you if you like what we like - - Deb and Shawn

It takes a man with small balls to disrespect women and not post a face shot. To post such garbage and your on strictly Platonic so you look twice as bad.Do you not know how many big woman are doing big things with big bank accounts? Do you not know it's shallow minded Americans like you that make America ugly? Not all woman were made to be a size 0 even doctors stated this fact. I bet your some pudgy old ugly man that is so desperate that he has to look for women on cl. I like to browse at all the pathetic men as yourself blaming women for the reason they don't want anything to do with you. It's time to self evaluate.Until you can see all people for who they are not simply by looks you will always be in the same shitty spot your in. Get over yourself cause I bet when your looking for Barbie and you think you found her she will tell you straight to your face your not the Ken I was looking for. If at the age of 40 your still this shallow your going to continue to be single. Leave the young woman alone don't be a creep. For all my big woman out there stay beautiful! There are real men out there who wants a real woman not some half starved stick that is only considerd beautiful in America. America is the only country who belittles woman so much based on weight. In other country's skinny is gross it means you can't have healthy children. So whoever you are not man but a boy,a man would not be so disrespectful get over the fact that until you get over being so shallow you will continue to be single.

Long have I been searching for you,
Long have you been searching for me,
As we wade blindly through the weary fog,
We become lost within a cycle that entraps us.
Through the monotony of daily life I trudge,
Through the monotony of daily life you trudge,
Until the mundane becomes second hand,
And fills each inspiration we take,
As it leeches out what inspires us to feel.
We have progressed greatly with our technology,
Yet we have regressed greatly with our humanity.
A click, a tap, a touch, 
And we're connected to the whole world,
Yet in our own world, we are disconnected,
The only thing that touches us is our solitude.
A few swigs here, a few puffs there,
Only suffice temporarily.
We become artists, we create.
And in the chaos of creation and entropy,
Something organized develops,
Something that inspires others, 
To make them feel again,
To make us feel again,
It connects us.
I've been chasing an idea of you,
You've been chasing an idea of me,
An ideal marathon with destination unknown.
Perhaps I should stop chasing, and let the idea of you go,
Perhaps you should stop chasing, and let the idea of me go,
The ideas fade away,
And reality becomes us, 
And we see what's right in front of our lives,
And we live.

If you're interested in joining us, the plan is to leave Seattle at 5am to head up to Heather Lake, arriving around 630a. We'll be stopping for a coffee along the way, as well as at the 24-hour Safeway up there for a snack to pack. 

If anyone wants to join, we can take two additional people. I realize it's last minute, but please don't hesitate to inquire!! :)

I'm 34, single, new to Seattle and live in First Hill. 

She's 19, visiting Seattle for a week and from Germany. We are both athletic-enough but not power-hikers. We are both photographers and will be getting some great snaps along the way. 

If interested, let us know ASAP please! I know it's last-minute and that most people work, sorry!

Hello, thanks for taking the time to check out my post. 

First, I try to be a gentlemen, treating all others well despite how they treat me. I am one who thinks women ought to be cherished. On a more worldly note, most girls have thought me quite attractive (at which point I usually mark them as slightly delusional or at least in need of a visit to the Optometrist). :P (yes, that is really me in the image, taken last Summer. No, I have not gained 90 pounds since then). :)

Most people (including myself, yes!) would say I have a great sense of humor and am quite witty. Regarding physical attributes, I am tall, have dark/golden blond(ish) hair (all my own :P), blue eyes, and I am told....dimples. What type of girl am I looking for? Open to many, but I want a girl who would make a great example to her children...Staying fit, self-control (not a glutton or very overweight), and, more importantly, setting a great example by the way she lives: the things she says and does. If you do choose to reply? A photo or two would be much appreciated, but I can understand if you wish to wait. *Location isn't a big deal. I am very flexible and can work from most anywhere.

I am very athletic. I enjoy sports and walks, jogs, and runs out amidst the beauty in the world we have been given. Are you looking for someone to visit the tulip fields with? I'd love it. Are you looking for someone to go on a picnic in the mountains with? I'd love it. To go for a walk beneath a moonlit sky, find a patch of soft green grass to lie down upon, and just relax and look up at the stars and listen to the sound of waves as they caress the shore? I'd love it. I am looking for a girl who appreciates these same sorts of things, the simple yet magical gifts that many people take for granted. I am a man of my word, and expect others to be the same whether the matter be very important or seemingly insignificant.

I seek to encourage healthy behavior and discourage unhealthy. It is a shame how much unhealthy behavior in our world today is not simply ignored or unspoken of but, in fact, is actually encouraged. 

There, a little easy stuff...a little of the more sober...and that's that. Hope to hear from you soon. I also have a few chat apps for those of you who prefer it to email (which includes myself). For now I am not interested in phone calls. so, just low key to begin with...if we hit it off and want to meet for a walk and a talk later? Wonderful. 

Whatever you choose, I hope you have a wonderful evening!

I am a cycling enthusiast, and I am looking for a cycling partner. I try to cycle 3 times a week, each about an hour. I like to cycle on Sammamish river trail, i90 trail, and I am open to other locations as well. I try to have various types of cycling (intervals, steady pace, periodization). I am also starting to do Velodrome cycling, so that's another option. 

Hoping to find another enthusiast, or a few of us, to start riding together... the weather has been awesome, an I am looking forward to it.

Do you love to write and express yourself artistically and perhaps an INFJ personality type, creative having many good ideas that are always coming to you but need a good fit with someone to make them happen !??? have book or movie ideas whether they ever come about or not just the feeling of what could be if they did excites you, see things different than most and a thinker ""outside the box"" type :-) Miss someone to take things further rather than watching life go by and knowing things just should be going in a different direction but looking for a partner of sorts to do the things you always dreamed of or started but never got to finish ?? Me too! I have written and recorded music and am good with words and lyrics but suck at the instrumentation part since I never learned to play one. I have many good ideas for movies and things as my life has been crazy and different than most people. I enjoy photography and nature as well especially being near the water. I am clean of drugs and don't smoke, no kids and am 46 just seeing where the next chapter in my life is to accomplish so many things that are on the horizon I have always know it and can feel it and know there is someone reading this that understands exactly what I am saying and feeling the same way! Two are better than one and sometimes it takes two to do things that are new and refreshing as ONE gets old and boring and redundant without anything new or exciting ever making it's way into our lives, because we fail to reach out to the unknown and live in complacency rather than being willing to experience ""new"" wonderful & exciting things and take some chances!

If you do reply and feel you are ready and serious to try something new and make a good friend in the process then you will already be on your way I promise as I have many good qualities and gifts I would love to share with someone of value and good character that is ready to become a team working side by side to fulfill many dreams and experience many new adventures with ;-) :-)

I don't drink but I am 420 friendly if you're down. I've been getting into going to the gym/ working out so maybe an exercise buddy would be nice.

I'm 31, have a job, all that fun stuff....I'm just looking for a cool chick, who likes video games, likes rock music, can handle anime on occasion, and might enjoy smoking green every blue moon. I know, tall order. Lol.

I'm also not entirely sure what I'm looking for. I have a 6 year old little girl, who is the most amazing thing that I have ever been given in life....she's my whole world.

I'm only saying these things because I believe in honesty, being open, and never bsing someone. Is this drama? A little. Is it drama like the baby momma drama a lot of people have? Nope.

I just want, as I said, a cool chick to talk to, get to know, and maybe hang out with....and if things progressed, cool, if not, whatever. However, unfortunately, looks are somewhat important if things were to progress, I'm not really into the ebony or BBW girls....just a preference. For friends however, I'm down with anything. Lol. If you're married, have a boyfriend, live at home, I don't care....I would just appreciate some conversation, maybe some flirting if that's what happens, and who knows, lets just play it by ear?

With your reply, please put your favorite animal in the subject line, and if you'd like, include a pic of you and I'll send one back in my reply. I sincerely hope to hear from someone, though I'm honestly not going to hold my breath...lol, I'd probably die. XD

Also, I am not down for a lot of crazy bs. I've had some responses that were from some really interesting people that I had to part ways with.

Hey Rihanna fans,

My name is Nicole and it's my 25th birthday on April 21st. Rihanna is going to be at the Key Arena on the 24th and I really want to go see her but none of my family or friends like her or can't get work off. 
I feel I must see her before I die and now seems like a good time so that's what this ad is all about.

I don't care if you're male/female, feminine/masculine, a dog or cat lover, eat mushrooms (ew) as long as you want to have a good time and like Rihanna! Alcohol and weed may be involved...I mean it's a Rihanna concert. :P

I think it would be wise to meet beforehand so I can make sure you're not insane and or a murderer (my parents will worry less) and you can make sure I'm not completely crazy too.

We are bothe highly educated, emplyed, sane....KINKY.... I am in my 50's, she is in her 20's. I drink and am 420 freindly. We seek an open minded female, who would feel comfortable being with a couple.

You would be tasked with helping to keep the home clean, maybe cook, there is yard space if you wanna grow veggies.. I often do. There is a dog.... A large sunny yard...

If you are trying to get back on your feet... I am certainly willing to help out.... Not with money... But with stability, structure, sanity and safety.

Today is Monday, and it's f*cking beautiful out....

I would like to find someone that is good at giving massages. I do a lot of hiking during the week. There is one day that I hike about 10 to 15 miles in one day. I would like to find someone that could give me a massage in the evening after I get home from that long hike. This would be a weekly thing, if you're interested please ask for details. I wouldn't pay the going rate for massages.

Hello! My name's Dylan, and I'm 23, white, and single. For starters, I am seeking a pen pal. So for all those that come across this ad looking for a friend that lives there, sadly that isn't me. I'm posting here today looking to talk to new people that are from a much difference place than myself, Texas, and that're interested in getting to know someone they'll possibly never meet. Reply with name, age, and anything else you'd like to share if you're interested. I prefer kik or texting, being that email takes longer, so you can also put your kik username or phone number if you wish and I'll reply that way. Age and/or race are unimportant.



Some things I enjoy:


Getting to know new people

Interesting conversation

Music (most genres)

Sports (watching and playing)

Anything outdoors (fishing, camping, hiking, etc)

Playing cards, dice, pool (anything competitive)

Running/jogging

Spending time with my family and friends

Movies

Going new places

Animals (I have a pup)

Reading

Art



I'm open to most anything really! Anyone interested please feel free to reply!

Intelligent, educated, professional, WM with a truly wicked sense of humor and a flair for the erotic, seeks an e-buddy to build synergy and to resonate with.

I get bored as hell at work because I do the same thing over and over. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me out of the loony bin is chatting it up...texting, email, IM, talking on the phone...Hell it could be smoke signals (no, not THAT kind of smoke), carrier pigeons, or bongo drums and I'd still enjoy it.

What I'm looking for is to make a connection...To have that spark happen when intelligent conversation and flirting are mixed together with the rush of meeting somebody new. BOOM! Explosive?...Oh hell yes! I love it!

So then what happens, you ask. Well, I'm separated and I'm definitely not looking to change anybody's situation while I figure out mine. I'm really not expecting that we hook up, date, or even meet for an ice cream sundae at a church social (I've never done it in a church, lol...Have you?). At the end of the day, I'm just hoping to find a gal pal who both enjoys some male attention and giving a guy that same attention. Anything beyond that...let's cross that bridge if we ever get to it.

So let's talk about you: A woman (sorry guys, nothing personal, I just don't swing that way), 40-60 (the age is just a suggestion because we're likely to have more in common...but if you're under 40 or over 60 and you think you're up for the challenge, then by all means). Race, looks, religion, occupation, politics, astrological sign, blood type, favorite football team, etc etc are unimportant. Marital status...that's an interesting one. I prefer you to be married or divorced...But, as with the age, if you think you're up for it, then by all means.

Turn On's:
A.) A woman who has a sense of humor as warped and irreverent as mine (You can laugh at almost anything).

B.) A woman who doesn't need me to carry the conversation all the time (aka isn't afraid to speak her mind).

C.) A woman with something going on upstairs (aka you know what synergy and resonance mean...or at least you're motivated enough to crack the dictionary).

D.) You're a fan of flirting and being flirted with. If you DON'T, let's not waste each others time.

Turn Off's:
A:) If you're somebody who thinks that bored people are boring, then carry your ass, sister. You're probably a princess and I don't need the headache.

B.) Likewise if you're going to be offended by my self confidence and think it's arrogance or conceit. If that's offensive or threatening, keep moving. There's plenty of gals who like self confidence in a man.

C.) Ditto on preaching about morality. If I want a lecture, I'll go to the aforementioned church and try that ice cream sundae.

D.) Nit Pickers. See A, Princess types for details. I'm not here to try and fix what's wrong with anybody and I sure don't need somebody doing it to me.

The rest of you gals, crack that dictionary, look up synergy, and drop me a line ;)

Hi,

I have two paid 3 day passes to the Seattle Erotic Art Festival held at the Seattle Center Exhibition Hall this weekend. I'm looking to find a date for one or all three days of the event, which starts this evening. If you haven't attended the Art Festival in the past, you're in for a treat. Here's a brief overview of the festival.

During regular festival hours, you are invited to view the art and daily entertainments, from poetry readings to pantomime to acrobatic displays. There is also the Festival Store, where you can often find prints by the artists featured in the festival as well as other unique items and annual Seattle Erotic Art Festival merchandise. In the evenings, the vibe changes from a gallery to sexy art party. The Late Night Festival is a sexy, fun time with DJs, performers, bartenders at the ready, and a fantastically energetic crowd.

I'm looking for an open minded fun and engaging lady to accompany me and experience all the festival has to offer. No expectations or reciprocation expected, I'll provide the tickets, companionship and transportation to and from the festival , we can go dutch for food, any art or souvenirs can be purchased independently by each of us.

Here's a little about your date:
I'm 48 - See Pic
Got a good job and car
6'2"" 220 Fit HWP
Easy going, charming, intelligent and witty with a bit of a mischevious personality. 

If you're interested in attending this event with me please feel free to respond and we can discuss the itinerary and I can answer any questions you have. I know this is late notice but I hope to find someone for tonight's opening and gala. No special attire needed just comfortable and sexy. You can check out more about the festival by searching for Seattle Erotic Art Festival.

Don't miss the opportunity to experience this fun and sexy event. 

I look forward to finding a date and haveing a great weekend.

Hi, welcome to the club :). There are nice, normal people on CL. I have met a few in the past and made some good friends. It can be tough finding just the right person. Sometimes it just feels good to feel attractive, with a touch of desire even if it requires being a little sneeky at times. Sometimes all you do, day after day, is for someone else, spouse, kids, aging parents. It's OK to take some time out for yourself, it's your life. If he can have a bowling or fishing buddy, can't you have a buddy too? I'm sure if you are still reading this, you must be semi normal with a twist of adventure. Thats the qualities of a woman I would like to get to know better. What are you thinking? Thanks for reading.

I love spending time on my 10 man raft on Wildcat lake. I love long drives to the ocean and other fun places. There are trips planned for this summer that you will be welcome to. Wildwaves in June, skydiving in july, and hemp fest in August to name a few. We also expert geeks: D & D, Medieval recreation, and white line witchcraft. Please NO: Tweekers, black magicians, lack of hygiene, or users. You will be expected to pay your way as will I. I have a car ( '01 Corvette at this time) and I live on the east side of Bremerton.

I have a passion for learning and am always interested in new and different things. I have two Boxers that I spoil rotten. I love them to death and they deserve it I enjoy going to fairs and festivals, reading, second hand shopping, binging on Netflix and Hulu, Doing crafts is a major hobby. I do a lot of paper crafting, mostly greeting cards, I use adult coloring books for stress reduction, I really enjoy the coloring and it does reduce stress. I take care of my 25 chickens and 3 turkeys. I live on a 20+ acre timber tree farm 5 miles south of Granite falls. Only 2 acres have been cleared, the rest is all wooded with paths going through it. There is also a large Trout pond. I am from Los Angeles, Corporate America, and retired to WA 9 years ago. I went through an overnight transition from city girl to country girl. It was difficult but I have come to love it here and hope I never have to live in the city again.

Hi there,

I am looking for an older woman who wants to just hang out and talk while we maybe backpack or jog Chambers Bay or other places in the Puget Sound. I am also down for additional sweat, but that is up to you. 45 - 60 is a plus. 

I love hanging out with experienced women. Hopefully we can connect on many levels. I don't care how you look, this is not one of those posts that seeks judgement. I just want you to be a person. 

Hope to hear from you soon

Okay so I've resorted to CL... Here goes. 

I'm looking for a friend, not a FWB. But someone who's kind, active or semi active, likes tv show marathons, hiking, cooking, reading and all sorts of other activities. I like to try new things.

You must be in somewhat good shape since I need someone who's actively motivated to influence my life. Nothing personal against others of a different life style but I've been down that road and I've been working really hard to get to my goal. I go to the gym regularly and do cardio but I still haven't reached it. That being said, I'm a pretty busy girl so I would appreciate someone who likes to just relax too. Watch a movie or we could cook for each other. 

This is strictly platonic! For those of you who don't understand the meaning of that word, it means NO SEX! I do prefer that you take good care of yourself though. Shower regularly, smells good, is at least some what attractive. Between the age of 25-40

Anyways, send me an email and tell me a little about yourself. Include a pic, please have clothes on! Be a gentleman and don't go asking me personal questions any decent woman wouldn't answer. If I feel comfortable with you we will meet for coffee. 

Hope to hear from you 😊

I have waste long brown hair, a few more pounds than I would like (but not obese), very healthy (no high blood pressure, no high cholesterol, no diabetes). Things that I like to do: I love live shows of all kinds (plays, comedy, opera, concerts, restaurants with live music, etc.), science (especially archaeology, paleontology and astrophysics), museums, the beach, Sunday afternoon trips, good wine, ethnic restaurants, dancing and spirited, intelligent conversations. Hoping to spend some of the winter months in Hawaii or Arizona in three years when I retire. Want to visit Egypt and Italy, and would love to explore the U.S. in an RV someday (I especially love the Southwest). I am happy, secure and independent. I love going out with my friends and won't give that up, but miss the companionship of a man. Most importantly, we both love to laugh! If you think you want to try to make me laugh, tell me something about yourself and SEND A PHOTO. I will send you a photo and more about myself, if I think there will be a connection (no photo, no reply). PLEASE no drugs addicts, no alcoholics, no smoking, NO MARRIED MEN, and have employment or a secure retirement, as the activities I enjoy tend to be a little expensive (I am not asking that you pay for me, but be able to pay for yourself). PLEASE live within 30 minutes of Lynnwood and be between 59 and 68. You may think I am very picky, but I like my life, so I am just looking for someone who will add to my contentment and well-being.

Is there anyone going to the Seattle Erotic Art Festival on Saturday that would like a companion to join them. I purchased an All Day Pass for Saturday and one for Brush Strokes at 6:30, wondering if there is another guy out there who would just like some company and interaction while we explore all that is there. I am not looking for a date or a sexual encounter (though I am not excluding the possibility), mostly looking for some camaraderie with a like minded guy who is into the erotic and the sexual as expressed artistically. I don't have an agenda for my time there (except for Brush Strokes), as I have never been before so am not entirely sure what to expect. I am open to stumbling around with someone else who's never been or tagging along with someone who has been in the past or who went to the opening on Friday. Not looking to be joined at the hip for the day and evening, but maybe meet up somewhere before hand, arrive together, see what piques our interests; together probe what intrigues us both and explore on our own that which attracts us individually. Perhaps to rendezvous on occasion to share what we've experienced, good and bad, and revise the game plan. I am planning on arriving sometime shortly after the Festival opens at noon, but I am flexible in that, and am willing too to meet up at the Festival if you're unable or would rather not go that early. HMU if you've got a ticket and are on your own (or even going with a few others) but would be open to some company at any point during your visit there. Am willing to share pics, if you'd like and my stats are posted here. I don't watch my email closely so expect some lag in response, but I will get back to you.

Now that we have nicer weather and more daylight, I'm looking for some people to join me in the great outdoors. Day hikes, snowshoeing, ski touring, mountaineering, backpacking, etc. I love to reach the quiet, pristine wilderness, which sometimes just requires a meandering walk along nice trails, and other times takes 2-3 hours of driving followed by 15, 20, even 25 miles of steep hiking over rough terrain. I don't go anywhere dangerous or extreme though, partly because I'm usually carting a bunch of camera gear! 

So I'm looking for people who are in pretty good shape for those longer trips, but are also fine with the simpler outings. And you'll have to put up with me stopping occasionally to set up a tripod and take lots of pictures. But hey, I have a high-clearance SUV that I can drive, and I'll offer to plan everything, so you shouldn't complain ;) Or if you want to take the lead planning and/or driving, that's fine too! 

You should live near Seattle so we can easily meet for our trips, and we'd probably be able to relate better if you're somewhere around my age, say no more than 10-15 years apart. Other than that, just have a personality that's fun to be around :)

First and foremost, I'm looking for a friend. 

I've fished around Craigslist, and though I'm certain it is probably a bad platform to find what I'm looking for, it's also free, and an easy way to put thoughts out there. There are a few posts I've seen from guys that are along the lines of what I'm looking for too, so my hope is that it exists.

I've hit a point where my friends are married, have kids, moved away, etc. My circle of close friends continues to shrink, so here I am. I am looking for an amazing person. Someone to spend time with (when we have time), go out with, stay home with, chill with. The reason I'm not looking for a ""relationship"" is due to time, and the fact that I don't ""look"" for that. What seems to be everyone's hitch, is that I'm looking for a friend that puts EVERYTHING on the table. 

I don't like the term ""friends with benefits"", because that's not what I'm looking for, but sex is certainly on that table. Make no mistake, it's never to be assumed, since we won't actually be in a relationship, but you should be close enough and comfortable enough to express when you're horny. I will be close & comfortable enough to do the same, and when those circles overlap, we shouldn't have any issues having a blast, and not worrying that our friendship will dissolve.

At the same time, what if we are dating other people? Well, that's part of being friends. I can be a good sounding board, and hopefully you can, as well. 

I'm looking for a legendary friend, who can be a best friend, a date, a stand-in girlfriend, a listener, a debater, or even just a couch potato or drinking buddy, and all those things must be presented at different times.

Before we get into the whole ""you shouldn't have posted this in this section"", I'll shut you down right now. If this isn't for you, feel free to move along, but you know what? People have some serious walls built up around them (in this city), like serious, Donald Trump walls around their emotions that distance them from other people. When we meet, we're going to do it differently. Someone on here once used the headline, ""Pretend we know each other"", and I liked it (so I'll steal it). We're going to just jump right in the middle of an amazing friendship.

Now, the superficial part: You need to be attractive, intelligent, put together, not allergic or afraid of dogs, and adventurous (in personality). I don't care how old you are, as long as we click. We both should have SOME attraction to each other, because that makes for a great pairing.

I've had friends like this in the past, and I miss them greatly. Let's find it again. I don't require a picture right away if you just want to feel me out, but I will require one before I send one (so if you want to see me, send a picture eventually). I will also require one before we meet.

Crazy things happen on Craigslist, and I know I'm a good guy, but I understand the hesitation. Let's push past and start something amazing. 

As long as this is up, I'm still searching for my best friend.

Whew. Done.

It's April 21, 2016, almost noon, and it's a gorgeous day outside! I want to get out and do something! Fun, action-packed, relaxing... I really don't care!

So here's the thing: I am trying to get out into the world as much as possible. My close friends moved away to different parts of the country, and the ones in the area have been so busy with their own lives. I too have been kept busy with work and school, but things are beginning to settle, and I have a feeling that it would be nice to meet new people. Who does not like making new friends?

I am pretty open-minded, love movies, and I am getting back into reading regularly. I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree, where I'm an economics/philosophy/political science major. Running is something I am re-learning to do (I was previously an avid runner), and I am training for a couple 5Ks. I savor the experience of food, especially Thai, where I cannot resist a good plate of pad see ew or pad kee mao. I'm learning to cook and I like comic books, so I have a few geeky moments.

I enjoy witty banter, have hobbies, and genuinely ask questions, so conversation will never be short.

Maybe you are working from home, or are just by yourself often, and are tired of the isolation...?

I work at home, doing computer stuff, and I go days without interacting with any humans.

I am wondering if I can find someone else that also works from home (or maybe alone in your small office) in the Seattle area. Maybe we can find a coffee shop or library, or even a picnic table at a city park, and work side by side -- but on our own stuff -- and keep each other company.

I am open to getting to know each other over email a while first before meeting in person.

I would prefer it that you be in Seattle, or close by, so neither of us spend time driving or stuck in traffic.

I don't want to ask if you're bored, but are you looking for someone to talk to? I'm available to make those minutes and hours between tasks perhaps go quicker. Maybe we can co-write the great american novel about a fantastic conversation in the making? Or we can get to know one another through meaningful questions back and forth.
I'm hoping for a chat that will foster communications after work, one that will have you looking forward to the next email, text or IM.
If you're in between 35 and 50, I believe we can have a decent amount in common. If you're outside of that range and you're still interested, let's see how it goes.
I'm open-minded, a good listener. I cannot solve your problems, but I can empathize with you about them. I don't care if you're married or single, just be willing to engage in conversation.

We seem to have moved way beyond writing letters and poetry, discovering the rich tapestry of friendship. What is the next frontier then? Who are we today that we don't dive deep, don't really share who we are, for fear, for sheer boredom?

Hey, thanks for clicking on my post. Hopefully this is the first step in making a new friend. So, I know that this Craig's List and this section isn't really for platonic friends anymore; it used to be but I guess not so much now. However, I still have faith that there are still people out there, like myself, that are just looking for friends. Ok, I moved out here a few years back and I make some really good platonic friends on here back then. Unfortunately, they've either moved away to Ballard (you know some place so far away that they refuse to leave their new The Shire to come back to visit the old one) or they actually moved away (out of the area). Again just to be clear, I'm truly just looking for platonic friends to do stuff with. Absolutely no funny business. Period. I'm a laid back, non-smoking, educated, progressive, ""lefty"", black guy looking to expand my circle. Bottom line, I'm just looking for friends who would be up for grabbing a drink sometime, going to movies, running/jogging, soccer/flag football, working out, hiking, rock climbing and talking. Good conversation is essential; being able to discuss issues [and solutions] in technology, the environment, world events/affairs, non-commerical media, politics (again I'm a proud, educated progressive but very respectful of differing views). I know that's a crazy laundry list, but I'm truly open to meeting new, non-flaky people. If any of this sounds interesting and you're not a flake, please feel free to email me back. Thank you again for clicking and reading. I look forward to melting the frost and making some new friends.

Hello and thanks for reading this.

I'm a professional guy in my 30's looking for a good conversationalist. Well, really I want a great one, but I will settle for good. Haha.

It does not really matter where you are located or who you are. Male, female, gay, straight, bi, trans, etc. Please just be intelligent, witty, or creative in some way. 

Ideally, like me, you work in front of a computer and are allowed the time to email during the day. 

So, are you looking for a penpal style friend to talk to during the day? Are you bored at work and in need of a distraction? Going through a hard time and need an emotional boost? Or do you just want to meet someone completely awesome?

If you answered yes to any of those questions then you should send me an email. 

I hope to hear from you.

Thanks again for reading this.

Thanks for taking time to read my ad. I have always been a big fan of literary erotica and have always wanted to write some of my own. I'm looking to find a woman who enjoys reading online erotica and would like to exchange emails. 

Here's how this would work. You send me an email of your favorite fetish/fantasy and I'll respond with a brief paragraph in the form of role play. I'll gladly play any part of your fantasy and nothing is too kinky. (Ideally, this would be perfect for anyone that's stuck in a boring relationship, but not looking to leave their significant other.) We'll exchange emails and eventually write a very hot story over time. This doesn't mean you have to write daily. Just write when you're in the mood. I've done this before and the results were amazing! 


About me: I'm not looking to ever meet you. In fact, I posted this ad in Seattle because I live thousands of miles away. There will be no chance of ever meeting. That being said, I don't mind sending you a pic once we get to know each other. I'm white, in my 40's, very attractive, workout daily, I run 3-5 miles a day.

So if you have ever wanted to live out a fantasy feel free to tell me what you're interested in and I'll gladly respond.

I enjoy most kinds of visual media. Video games especially, they engage me more. Though I love a good movie or TV show if I am in a more laid back mood. Eating out and going to the movies is a standard night out. I am a creative person, I like to think, and have a long history in art.

Hello,

I am a 27 year old man and due to some infidelity on her part, my wife has moved out. We are now separated and I have found myself completely alone out here in a cold home with no one else but my puppy dog.

I am not necessarily looking for a romantic or sexual relationship, though I wouldn't be totally opposed to one if it were to develop. I am mostly just looking for a cool person to hang out with. I'd love to snuggle up in the bed, under the heated blanket, grab some pizza and enjoy each others company as we watch something on the TV. Something like Mystery Science Theatre 3000, Rifftrax, Rick & Morty, Futurama or the like.

I am a pretty introverted guy who enjoys his alone time, but I don't like being completely on my own. I don't intend on replacing my wife or something, but meeting some new people out here would be good for me. To give you an idea of who I am, I am studying Game Design. I like video games, movies, TV, and most any other form of visual media. I draw, write, sculpt, and constantly look for other creative outlets for myself. I tend to prefer quiet nights in, entertaining myself with the things or people around my home. However, I can be convinced to go out for a movie, a meal, etc.

If any of this sounds like something you would be interested in, please, get in touch with me. Just reply to this posting or if you have kik you can find me at ""funnyhandlehere""

One request: Please don't flag:)

So, I have posted couple of times on CL offering a free massage.

I used to do this quite a bit earlier in another city (moved here 4 yrs ago) and I would easily find folks to trade massages with. If nothing, it'd be at least a one way massage. 

It was so strange - for both my ads, I got very few responses...lol. 

Thought - I was doing something wrong so thought of seeking feedback. What would be a concern seeking a platonic massage through CL? 

I mean, Massages are fairly expensive so a free one should be interesting, right? As for safety, I first offer to meet in public, talk on phone and even keep the first massage as simple as possible - for example just arms or just neck. No full body or anything that'd make you uncomfortable with a stranger. I can also offer couple of references from my friends in NYC and now couple in Seattle who I have done this with. Not once have I crossed the decency line. I'm a gentleman with a normal life, job, education etc. High hygiene and to those it matters, I look decent too.

Why I do it - its fun really. Meeting someone new and the possibility of finding a massage trading partner is awesome. I enjoy the touch - giving or receiving but have zero expectations beyond that. Relaxation and the chat and the idea of meeting someone new is just awesome!

Overall, its full transparency so wanted to know what could I still be missing in my offer?

Any and every feedback is welcome - feel free to just curse me too:) Even that is a feedback!

Btw - I got a question saying if its platonic, why m4w and not m4wm - well when I was in NYC, I started out as m4mw and the experience was far from ideal. It was 3 out of 3 for guys wanting more than just a massage. Girls have been more conservative so its been easier to draw the line!

I want to be honest up front - I am a married Indian man and I am missing the closeness and tenderness of a woman in my life. I really miss having a woman to talk to about the little things in life that we can laugh at together. I want to have a friend that I can call and talk with. All I know is I miss having someone to care for, appreciate, respect and adore!

I have been married for a long time, but regretfully the spark and attraction is gone. So I am looking for someone special to connect with. I am sure that there must be some ladies out there in the same situation that I am. Perhaps your husband is busy with work and does not have time for you and your needs and speaks a different language than you.

If that's the case, then hopefully we can fulfill each other's needs for happiness while staying married to our spouses. I'm hoping for a supplementing, private relationship in which we can make each other feel wanted and desired again. One where a married woman and a married man provide each other with the friendly loving we both crave. 

Naturally none of us should be into games or one-nighters! If we are on the same page about what we want, send me an email -- possibly to explore this discreet, adventurous new friendship.

I am tired of replying to ads supposedly looking for intelligent conversation only to be disappointed. So many precious minutes and possibly dozens of calories spent on wasted keystrokes. My poor fingers ache from typing what modern science and literary authorities could only call masterpieces of prose and intellectual ass-kickery, only to be met with shitty grammar and horribly spelled replies asking what my ""hobies"" are. My hobies!? MY HOBIES!? Slaying shitty spellers with mind bullets, them's my hobies! Pew pew!

So I've decided a change of tactics is in order. I'm hoping someone reads this, can sift through all my layers of bullshit, and see me for the poor, underprivileged, lonely, intellectually superior sex machine that I am. Cue the Sarah McLaughlin song... sad puppy dog eyes... pew pew...

So I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm freaking bored. It's almost 11pm, I'm stuck at work, and you should talk to me cuz I'm pretty much amazeballs. Like, a lot. I enjoy smart talks. Be liberal. Be conservative. Convince me why you're right and I'm wrong of something. There's a cookie in it for you! Be scientific. Be political. Be historical. Be an art critic, a music nerd, explain why you like your favorite band, and why mine sucks. Be brutal!!

But most of all keep in mind that at the end of the day I win. Cuz science.

Oh and I am often full of shit.

I'm a single guy, 32 years old, hoping to find a female friend to occasionally hang out with for gaming and/or watching shows together. Platonic. Specifically RPG gamers... not really into first person shooters or sports games. Currently playing WoW, Dark Souls II, Diablo 3 (PS4) and always up for trying new RPG's, also like board games and working on producing my own. 

Shows? Walking Dead, Penny Dreadful, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Supernatural, Hemlock Grove, Being Human (U.K.) ... mostly fantasy stuff, or shows that are really well-written and have stellar ratings, such as Breaking Bad. 

I'm introverted (INFP) and probably asexual. Especially interested to meet and befriend other iNtuitives ; ) I'm stable and most of the time just enjoy being alone, but also been thinking it would be sweet to have a platonic gaming friend. I don't care what your race, creed or orientation is, as long as you have the soul of a female!

Hey, I really like motorcycle but always thought I was too short to ride one. I finally uttered the courage and got my ninja 250, along with the endorsement. 

I'm looking for a friend, strictly a friend to be a mentor to me and ride with me, teach me, and show me some good rides. I'm hoping to find someone closer to my age, 25-35.

A little about me- I'm of Asian origin, independent and 30yro. I'm super easy to talk to and love learning new things. I've only ridden on the street couple of times. I'd love to meet someone patient that would ride with me and ride at my pace.

I am married. I like to be in harmony with the world around me. Wow, that sounds new age, but I'm very down to earth 😉 I like to read a lot and keep up with many things-- culture, travels, food, people.

I especially value humor, being able to laugh at yourself, being able to communicate, culture in general, staying healthy, and the freedom to think out of the box.

I also like English Drama movies, Jogging, Cycling, Swimming, hearing people's stories, and simply talking with people.

I'm looking for a companion--somone with her own life, with a strong personality, yet also able to make the compromises that life sometimes requires. Someone who isn't too thin and who is able to laugh at herself. No smokers, please.

Hi girls! I'm a woman in my mid 40s, a suburban wife and mother juggling work, family and all the responsibilities that come with it. My life is good but I want to make it better. I'd like to develop a friendship with a like minded woman who is bold, fun, well humored and smart. A kind of friendship that goes beyond talking about work, our kids & spouses, what we're cooking for dinner. 
I'd love to have someone to do all the usual things girl friends do (coffee, lunch, happy hour, manis, shopping, going on little adventures) but with an extra dimension - someone who isn't judgmental, is open minded and won't mind discussing what turns us on, what secret desires we have - things we can't bring to the conversation table with current friends! I'm straight but I have secret thoughts about girls and lately I've been obsessed with boobs! I'm not looking to do anything with you (unless it happens naturally), I just want to be able to talk about adult topics without being judged!
I'm reasonably attractive and intelligent, have a sarcastic sense of humor, employed, clean and would appreciate all of the same in you. I drink socially, smoke cigarettes, don't do drugs, not into 420. If you're looking for a friend like this too please email me. But if you do, tell me a little about you, what made you respond to my ad. No one liners and please be somewhat close to my age so we can relate and close to my location. I don't necessarily need a pic but if I get one I'll return the favor. 
Thanks for reading this long, rambling, badly written ad. I'm not very good at really putting what I'm looking for in words, but I hope it resonates with at least one person!!

Hello,

I am a SWF, 48, educated and professionally employed. I have lived here about a year and been pretty occupied with work a business travel. My travel has slowed and now that the sunny spring (almost summer like) weather has decided to show herself it would be great to find someone to get out there and enjoy it with me. 

I am okay with being single but open to something more should there be a connection and seeking someone like minded. It's not a requirement to spend time with me. I am just at a stage in life where enjoying the days with good company, good conversation and enjoying great food/scenery or entertainment without pressure is best.

I have a variety of interests from sports, boating, camping to art and music. In general I love being outdoors and this is such a beautiful place to live for that. I have a pleasant personality, witty and very upwardly mobile.

I am in search of close female friendship. I have spent last eight years focusing on professional development and for a variety of reasons, my circle of friends has changed and dwindled.

I mention these two TV shows because both depict female friendship at different stages of life; a more innocent and care-free relationship, and a relationship forged out of a need for mutual support during a challenging life transition. 

I am not into the idea of smoking the amount of weed Abbi and Ilana do on Broad City, but I can get into the way they are silly, adventurous, and loyal. I may not know the betrayal of my husband leaving me for another man and having my life implode as Grace and Frankie do, but I have experienced my share of implosions and I understand the maturity and flexibility adult friendship requires.

So at age 45, I am looking for something that falls somewhere in the middle of these two examples. If any of this makes sense to you then please reply and let's see if we can be friends!

I'll get this out in the open right up front.

I do not want to sleep with you. I do not want to exchange nude pictures. And i do not want phone sex.

I am looking for a friend. Just one. But i want something deeper than friendship. I want the proverbial soulmate. Without sex.

I am not looking to pass my workday. I am not looking for the excitement of a new female being provocative. I am looking for something meaningful. Deep. I want something close and intimate without the stress and instability sex creates.

I could go on like every other post about how wonderful i am and why you should reply to my ad, but the person i am looking for will know what they need to about me from what i have revealed of myself in this ad.

If you choose to reply, include a reasonably recent face picture. Eyes showing is a must. While i am looking for something platonic, attraction is essential. 

I don't have high hopes here. Both what i seek and what i offer are exceptional. But the universe has surprised me before.

Yes, the picture is me.

Hi!

I'm a 25 year old student. I've been teaching myself Korean for about ten years now, but I think I've hit the limit of what I'm able to achieve on my own. I have Korean and Korean-American friends, but I always feel weird asking them for help because I don't want them to feel like they're my tutor.
Hence why I'm here! I would like to meet someone, either for coffee or through something like Skype, at least once a week for an hour or so just to talk and practice my Korean conversation. You don't have to teach me anything, just correct me if I make a mistake, as I'll be teaching myself. My spoken Korean isn't very good because I rarely speak it, I understand a lot more than I can say, which is why I need someone I can speak to who is willing to correct me when I make a mistake. 
If you're from Korea, I'd also love to help you with your English if you feel you also need improvement.
Since this isn't tutoring and conversation, we should have at least something in common as, if we click, I'd love for us to be friends. I'm a psychology student. I don't watch a whole lot of TV except for a few shows that I really love, like The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Supernatural, and Criminal Minds. I really only watch Korean dramas to improve my listening skills. The only Korean show I watch regularly is Running Man - I LOVE that show. Gag Concert is also really good, too.
As for movies, I really like horror and thrillers, but I'll pretty much watch anything.
Music - I listen to all sorts of music. Some off the top of my head are Beyonce, Elle Garden, Wang Leehom, Jay Zhou, Zion T., Gummy, JooYoung, and Junsu. I don't really listen to idol groups except for Big Bang, I mostly listen to solo artists.
I'm fairly easy to get along with. I'm willing to talk about almost anything because a lot of stuff interests me, so don't be shy =)

Hello,

I've been looking through Craigslist to find a woman or women I can become friends with. Although I'm having a hard time finding someone who isn't into 420 (not that I have anything against it, I just not comfortable with it) or someone who refrains from using vulgar language, doesn't smoke and rarely drinks, etc.. I do have friends with who are into one or all of those thing...but it would be nice to be able to be myself w/o being self-conscious because they would change their behavior when they interact with me. 

Ok, here's a little intro about myself. I'm in my 30's. I like art, painting/drawing, a wide range of music but more so into the top 40's, hiking, inline skating, various TV shows and a bit of a movie fanatic. I'm also a foodie...I like trying out different restaurants. I have interests in traveling and taking long road trips, going to the park and just relax. My two favorite parks to go to are Alki Beach and Coulon Park. I also don't mind going out shopping with my female friends....I actually enjoy it. Every once in a while I tend to have a cheesy sense of humor. I'm also a semi-geek. I like playing board games and play RPG MMO's...currently playing Black Desert Online...I use to play WoW. 

I tend to write decent size email....like 2-4 paragraphs and it would be nice if you're that way, too. I prefer to exchange emails for a while and then go from there....

        Yes, I'm a older retired gentleman but interests and effections tend to be with the younger ladies. Maybe this sound like a ""Dirty Old Man"", but I just don't feel old when it comes to my effections and desires. I just really love being around younger women and if they have kids or are pregnant, it take me back to my previous married and family life. Then, I was so busy with a career and working over seas, I seldom had the opportunity to enjoy this. 
I see CL posts here that indicate there are married, seperated or single moms out there that, I might hope, would appreciate, at first a casual relationship. Become chat friends, get to know and understand each other. My adult niece and I are close and she refers to me a ""Sweet Uncle"" and encourages me to seek out someone younger, 
Eventually, once an understanding and trust is extablished, I would hope that FWB relationship, something on the down-low, as required. I'm open to a more committed relationship but don't want to push my ""good luck1"" ;} 
If you will contact me with your situation and interests, I will repond and we can discuss this further.

I will exchange picture, details and txt/phone # with my reply to your response.

I have one of those.  I have about 50 family pictures of her, some favorites I really enjoy masturbating to.  If you would like to talk about our sister-in-laws and share fantasies about them, drop me a note.  I do like to share pictures of mine for comments and discussion but would like the same.  No internet garbage - just the cropped G rated pictures that we all have of our sister in laws that we collected thru the years.  If you tell me you have no pictures of your sister in law, you are probably lying.  Would love to ask questions about yours, and most of all, comment on her pictures.

Drop me a note with ""SIL"" in the subject line so I know you are real.

I like reading (though I very rarely do it anymore), going out on the boat, quadding, watching movies (if I can stay awake lol), working on stuff with my husband, and spending time with my family.


Oh, and one other thing - I don't want people to know that we met on Craigslist.  It sounds stupid I know.  So if you're up for making a new friend, reply back to my message and put your favorite hobby in the subject.  I look forward to hearing from you!

Seriously, if you make it sexual at all there is 0 chance I will reply to you. I'm just looking to meet some people that I can, I don't know, text with and bullshit around throughout the day or whatever. Maybe meet up if they're cool and hang out in a few weeks once I've gotten to know them. Nothing more.

I enjoy a lot of different stuff. Feel free to list what you like and I'll do the same.

I'm not too picky, but as a general tip: if you think 'lose' is spelled as 'loose', enjoy gossip, or otherwise have the emotional maturity of a high-schooler, save us both the time, okay?

        Simply looking for a traveling companion to travel the roads of the US.

I am a 42 year old 6' 7"" tall 235lb gentle giant who travels full time in my classic motorhome enjoying the open road, mother nature and the freedom of life without anything to keep me tied to one place. I have prepared for another few years of traveling with enough food and outdoor gear to make camping even in the middle of nowhere enjoyable and memorable. I plan to put my/our finger on a map and just drive. To see the sights and to camp where we please both in the national forests of the US as well as in the cities.

The ultimate road trip across the states living in a fully equipped 32 foot RV rather than a small cramped car. I have a 7' long truly comfortable leather couch in front or the dinette turns into a bed if you are under 5' 5"". If you don't mind co-sleeping I have a large queen adjustable mattress in the bedroom with a memory foam topper that is truly amazingly a dream to sleep on. A full kitchen and bathroom with a shower and half bathtub. Enough camping and outdoor gear to keep us both comfortable as well as prepared for pretty much anything that might come up with on the road.

See the sights of the west coast and beyond. No worries of needing to be anywhere at any time because we make up our own schedule as we go. Stay where we want for as long as we want...

Search the community rideshare section for the following to read more about the trip... ""looking for a multi-state motorhome female traveling companion""

I want to spend the next few months finding the right traveling companion for the trip, getting to know them online and the phone and then spend the few weeks before the trip begins to get to know them in person by spending those few weeks camped out in the local casino RV parking section with them as a litmus test on our compatibility. If everything clicks then away we go on the adventure of adventures but should for some reason we not meld then ""Que Sera Sera"" and we part ways while still in the city and close to home.

Not exactly looking for a relationship but as in life one never knows what is going to happen. That being said, I am really nice guy that loves to listen and can give a back/body massage for hours so it would be a good start I think to something more maybe.

Look forward to hearing from you...

        I am posting it under platonic, as I believe massage is a platonic activity :)

Yoni is the Sanskrit word for the vag+ina that is loosely translated as ""sacred space"" or ""Sacred Temple."" In Tantra, the Yoni is seen from a perspective of love and respect. This is particularly important for men to learn.
Before beginning the Yoni Massage it is important to create a space for the woman (the receiver) in which to relax, from which she can more easily enter a state of high arousal and experience great pleasure from her Yoni. Her partner (the giver) will experience the joy of giving pleasure and witnessing a special moment. The Yoni Massage can also be used as a form of ""safe sex"" and is an excellent activity to build trust and intimacy. Some massage and sex therapists use it to assist women to break through sexual blocks or trauma.

The goal of the Yoni massage is not solely to achieve orgasm, although orgasm is often a pleasant and welcome side effect. The goal can be as simple as to pleasure and massage the Yoni. From this perspective both receiver and giver can relax, and do not have to worry about achieving any particular goal. When orgasm does occur it is usually more expanded, more intense and more satisfying. It is also helpful for the giver to not expect anything in return, but simply allow the receiver to enjoy the massage and to relax into herself.

I am Asian guy and I receive more the pleasure in giving it. 
Please be real do not waste my time and your time as I am not going to sign up your page or any scam so if you real just email me back and type ""I am real"" in subject line. 
Lets chat and get to know each other that way we both be feel comfortable.

        Hello gentlemen. I'm a 34 year old mother to 3 wonderful boys (16, 14, 11). I'm married (17 years), Latina and can have an attitude.  Just to help you out on the math, I got married at a really stupid age of 18. Lol

I'm not here to change my situation. I just want to make new friends online. I've always found guys to be more willing to listen and have a conversation. I'm not looking to meet so please respect that. 

Pictures aren't necessarily off the table but it takes time to build up some sort of trust, especially on CL. 

I know it's really late but any company would be appreciated.  Please change the subject to Friends Only so I know how to weed out the spam. 

Hope to hear back from you soon.

        Intelligent, educated, professional, WM with a truly wicked sense of humor and a flair for the erotic, seeks an e-buddy to build synergy and to resonate with.

I get bored as hell at work because I do the same thing over and over. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me out of the loony bin is chatting it up...texting, email, IM, talking on the phone...Hell it could be smoke signals (no, not THAT kind of smoke), carrier pigeons, or bongo drums and I'd still enjoy it. 

What I'm looking for is to make a connection...To have that spark happen when intelligent conversation and flirting are mixed together with the rush of meeting somebody new. BOOM! Explosive?...Oh hell yes! I love it!

So then what happens, you ask. Well, I'm separated and I'm definitely not looking to change anybody's situation while I figure out mine. I'm really not expecting that we hook up, date, or even meet for an ice cream sundae at a church social (I've never done it in a church, lol...Have you?). At the end of the day, I'm just hoping to find a gal pal who both enjoys some male attention and giving a guy that same attention. Anything beyond that...let's cross that bridge if we ever get to it.

So let's talk about you: A woman (sorry guys, nothing personal, I just don't swing that way), 40-60 (the age is just a suggestion because we're likely to have more in common...but if you're under 40 or over 60 and you think you're up for the challenge, then by all means). Race, looks, religion, occupation, politics, astrological sign, blood type, favorite football team, etc etc are unimportant. Marital status...that's an interesting one. I prefer you to be married or divorced...But, as with the age, if you think you're up for it, then by all means. 

Turn On's:
A.) A woman who has a sense of humor as warped and irreverent as mine (You can laugh at almost anything). 

B.) A woman who doesn't need me to carry the conversation all the time (aka isn't afraid to speak her mind). 

C.) A woman with something going on upstairs (aka you know what synergy and resonance mean...or at least you're motivated enough to crack the dictionary).

D.) You're a fan of flirting and being flirted with. If you DON'T, let's not waste each others time.

Turn Off's:
A:) If you're somebody who thinks that bored people are boring, then carry your ass, sister. You're probably a princess and I don't need the headache.

B.) Likewise if you're going to be offended by my self confidence and think it's arrogance or conceit. If that's offensive or threatening, keep moving. There's plenty of gals who like self confidence in a man.

C.) Ditto on preaching about morality. If I want a lecture, I'll go to the aforementioned church and try that ice cream sundae.

D.) Nit Pickers. See A, Princess types for details. I'm not here to try and fix what's wrong with anybody and I sure don't need somebody doing it to me.

The rest of you gals, crack that dictionary, look up synergy, and drop me a line ;)

        Hello and good afternoon. CL has a reputation of playing host to a bunch of weirdos who pass off as someone they arent. Im not into any of that. Im a straightshooting sort of guy. 

Why waste time, right?  Just looking to pass the night exchanging emails. Nothing dirty, insensitive, or stupid. Just want to pass the night away getting to know someone I'll probably never meet.

        Well, you have a Valid, a very valid pointe. 

Now, how do I put this.

Sometimes we get caught in the Ego thinking trap. The thing is If we're seeking a relationship for either Pleasure, Stimulation, or to use the Pleasure and Validation to plug a hole in our Ego then it IS like a Drug.  

Drugs! with Drugs you have the High then you have the Low. So people seek the High to get rid of the Low. Nonetheless, one comes right after the other. Just the same as the law of Gravity. It's a law.

Relationships can be the same. When we meet someone who excites us it gives us that High. In fact the same Neurotransmitters that are stimulated from Drugs are the same ones that are stimulated by our Pleasurable feelings. Sometimes the high is so great that we feel like we're in Love. However, we're in Love with the way that person makes us feel, not really the person.

Then if we take too much stock in the Pleasure the Low comes and hits us hard. The Negative feelings can come and hit us hard. Don't you know, the Pleasure is the seed of Pain because deep down you'd end up missing the Pleasure as you find faults in your Partner. 

This is why some people seek perfection. They seek perfection for the same reason as someone with OCD seeks perfection. This is the Perfect way to avoid Pain, Anxiety, and all the negative emotions. The perfect man or woman, Perfect for me, My Mr. Right, these are all illusions created for Self-Defense. The Ego is constantly comparing and seeking to Identify it's self with something and that's why it wants Mr. Right. When The Ego fails to find Perfection (even if it is the one that is Perfect for you, that's a Justification), it creates Pain and Loss because it distorts the Ego's Identity. 


Are Relationships bad then.... Absolutely NOT!

No, we just go about things the wrong way. Has anyone really deciphered the difference between their Thinking Self and their Decision making Observing Self? The Ego, the part with the wants, needs, desire to get High off Life or Drugs, etc is all part of the Thinking Self. The Observing self gets completely wrapped up in the Illusion.

The trick is to see through it and see through the Ego.

So, you would need to host.. That's all I'm really looking for, I don't care what you look like or how old you are (as long as you are legal to smoke), just want someone to smoke with at their place. I have my own stash, so it wouldn't be like you'd have to provide anything, besides a place to smoke and something to smoke out of. Though if this becomes regular, I would ask that you bring some of your own as well, just to be fair and what not. Anyhow, hope to hear from some chill people soon!

        I must be out of my mind to think I'll meet a smart, attractive and truly funny woman on CL looking to befriend an attached dude for a platonic exploit. But what the hell. I'll either prove myself right after receiving replies from nothing but guys masquerading as women and hooker bots...or perhaps someone will prove me wrong.  If you're here reading this, you'll know who you are. 

I'm late 40s, live and work in Seattle as a so-called ""professional"", am well educated, fit and married. Too much is missing in my day to day life to be truly satisfied and I'm hoping to make contact with someone in a similar situation who is looking for an outlet to share some giggles...or even tears. 

Why does attraction matter in strictly platonic?  Because it just does, as much as I know that makes little rational sense!

        I'm an experienced musician and home producer who is interested in teaching someone else how to play and record music. My goal is to improve my own understanding of music and recording, as well as to make a new friend in the process. I play the guitar, bass, drums, keyboards, vocals, and digital synths. My method of making music is modern and somewhat non-traditional, however I do come from a traditional background(i.e. I can read music and I know a bit of theory). My style is modern/indie rock fused with electronic, along with whatever else that sounds good to me. I don't really 'go for a sound'; I just create. My influences include: Bach, The Beatles, NIN, Pinback, The Beach Boys, Radiohead, Weezer, Fleetwood Mac, Boards of Canada, as well as tons of jazz, film scores, video game scores, and more. My home studio is a comfy, clean, laid back space. Plenty of video games, sweet colorful lights, and movies to help inspire or distract!

        Do you enjoy paper crafting?  Making greeting cards, scrap booking?  I really enjoy this hobby but it would be much more enjoyable to share it with friends.  Hopefully, beyond the crafting, we could become good friends and enjoy many activities together.  But starting small is often a good thing, so lets focus on the crafts.  We could get together every few weeks and work on our individual projects while getting each others input.  I have hundreds of stamps, tons of paper stock and all kinds of accessories.  Add to that your supplies and I'm sure we could create some incredible crafts.  If you are interested don't hesitate, contact me. I don't care what your ethnic background is, your age, your experience level, your sexual preference, there are no barriers for you women.  Please NO MEN.

        So, here's the deal. I miss fun, active conversations. As of late, my life has been far too serious. I'd like someone to help bring the fun back into my little spot in the world. I'd like to look down at my phone and smile or laugh. Boredom and I are too well acquainted and as they say, ""idol hands are the Devils workshop"". So, to start, I'm looking for friends, and if that's all, then that's fantastic. However, if more should naturally occur, I certainly would not shy away. I don't have much in respects to requirements, but I do ask that you not be completely psychotic, as I do not need the dramatics. I do prefer to text or call over email, but that's minor details. Please put your favorite movie in the subject line so I can avoid the scammers. Hope to hear from you soon.

        Hi!
I am looking to connect with a great guy on a friendship level that may have the potential to turn into something more in the future. I have a lot of female friends,  but lack in the male department and I miss it! There are things that I dig that my girls aren't necessarily crazy about,  and that I'm hoping to find in a male friendship. I'm big into sports and working out. I'm a competitive runner, do Yoga, weight train and intense SPX Full Body workouts.  I love science fiction and horror movies as well. I'm a type A personality that is very direct and straight forward. That's a rarity in Seattle, so I'm not looking for anyone that is passive aggressive.  I'm educated with a great job, fit/lean build, cute and very social. I'm confident and mentally stable. I ask you be the same. Since this is CL, I'm prepared for disappointment, so I'm hoping that there is that someone that will suprise me! Put ""friendship"" in the subject line or your response will be deleted. Preferably reside in the Seattle area and if you would like to send a picture, I'll be happy to reciprocate. No nudes or shirtless pics. Your response will be deleted right away. It's distasteful and classless. No married men or men in a relationship. No exceptions! Please be social, well traveled, around my age and athletic. I don't ask for what I can't offer!

I live in Tumwater and can host a friend or friends, all I ask is that you're chill n respectful, as I do not live alone.  Oh n you must be cool with big dogs.  I can also travel.  I would prefer if you were at the very least old enough to drink.  If we're going to be cool n hang out we're gonna drink eventually.  I guess I'll draw the line at 40-45, any older n I fear the bud might be the only thing we'd be able to talk about.  Anyways hit me up if this might interest you, and yes you will be expected to at least bring a joint or a bowl when we meet, I'm not looking for free loaders.

        Hello - I'm a generally lonely person seeking an online correspondence with another writer.  It doesn't even have to have much to do with writing although if a supportive writer to writer  relationship grew out of this that would be great.

About me - I have a professional level job and I've published a number of poems online and in print but never really tried to publish a book of poetry.  I HAVE written a few book-length works of genre fiction and self-published one.  All in all my professional writing career has netted me less than $1000.

What I like - music (prog rock, punk), weird stuff from the internet, the poetry of Frank Stanford, the novels of Raymond Chandler and JRR Tolkein.  I recently took a week long trip down to New Orleans just to check it out before it gets swallowed by the Gulf of Mexico.

        How long do you stay in a relationship where someone is not as interested in sex as you are? 


He would rather make friends with every woman around him. Making me have to be friends with them and barely fucking me. I'm very attractive he even tells me so. On average he fucks me twice a month for about four minutes tops. He LOVES women, he loves me, but not enough to want to make love to me. It's just never happened. 


I love him. He is my world. I crave intimacy and won't step out. It breaks my heart and soul. 


It's almost like he has me do he thinks he doesn't have to work for it. I guess he doesn't because I've stayed.

        Hey hey - 

Hope all is well for you guys out there! I'm a 27 year old gay gamer looking for other fellow gamers. I mainly play Action/RPG/Fighter/FPS video games on consoles like PS4 or 3DS/WiiU. However, I have had quite an interest in board games recently. I've only played a handful of board games but would not be opposed to meeting others who are interested video/board games.

I've lived here for over a year and would like to expand my circle of friends. I'm a 5'8"" latino with a stocky build. I'd say. I can be very introverted at first but once I feel pretty comfortable, my true colors show. I absolutely love to laugh and make other laugh all the time :D 
I regularly 420 with edibles or flower/dabs, so if you're cool with that -- awesome!

I'm hoping to find friends who like to play multiplayer games like Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Cal Of Duty, ect. I'd like a reason to get out of the house and chill/play video games.

Although this ad may be target toward other gaming buddies, I do not want to restrict it to just gaming. I also enjoy checking out Seattle, eating at new places, cooking for others, networking, building, shopping, walking around and just having all around fun.

I am also looking to find a friend I can be sexually open with. I don't have many friends that I openly talk to about sex. I would very much enjoy having a mate who would like to occasionally jerk off and cuddle. 

If this sounds like something you're looking for, drop me a line.

        Hello,

I want to sharpen my photography skills in the hopes of developing a style and in the process meet some cool new friends.

I'm an amature photographer purchased a Canon T5i about a year ago and would like to start shooting portraits, some b&w lingerie basically get a feel for human form, lighting, settings etc. All pictures will be deleted unless I have your consent to keep your absolute favorite shot and of course If you also have a camera I can return the favor. I will hate to discourage anyone from participating you don't have to be a model just be in shape and have a little creativity remember it's a learning process for both.

I have time during the week preferably evening it all depends but weekends work best. Message me if proposal sounds interesting. We can coordinate details and get to know each other a little better before meeting perhaps coffee or walk in the park. 

I'm 29 years old, slim athletic, 5'10 educated and looking to connect with girls interested in photography, art, modeling, architecture, science, cooking and whatever else you are interested in. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Daniel

        This feels a little odd but I've come to realize how hard it is to make friends in a new place so I thought I'd post on here and see if anyone would like to chat and maybe eventually someone to hang out and explore around Washington.

A little about me, I'm into a little bit of everything. I like having a balance between being out and about like hiking or shooting pool as well as having a more chilled night, catching up on shows or playing games. I have a few tattoos, can drive and I'd say I'm pretty self sufficient. I also love also catching live music shows - typically indie, alternative or some edm. If you know any good shows coming up or great venues to check out, feel free to let me know!

Hopefully I've caught your attention. If I have, feel free to drop me an email. We can chat a bit and see how it goes from there! I suppose to help weed out the generic spam emails, change the subject to the name of a song that's been playing on your playlist lately :)

        Fed up with just getting spam in your email inbox? Me too. So let's see if we can change that by getting to know each other online. It would be cool to check email and actually be looking forward to reading something we would want to read.
I am intelligent and able to converse about almost anything, open minded too so you probably can't offend me.
I am not really looking to meet, so I don't care what you look like, your age or your marital status. Intelligence would be a huge plus. No need to send any pictures either, while that could happen eventually, it is not something I want to do straight away, let's get comfortable with each other first.

I look forward to hearing from anyone, you will get a reply if you message me.

I do want to emphasize that I am not here to ruin what you have at home.  That is your personal area and I want you be able to go back to wife and mom with confidence when we aren't around each other.  If you are on the shorter side and fit or slightly chubby, that would be great.  I also am a huge fan of the relaxed look, tights and jogging shoes, and a woman who likes the nylons and a dress look.  You be between 30 and 50.

I am a stable, normal good looking white man.  I am in good shape for my age, told I look younger than 41.  I have had a vasectomy years ago, so you won't have to worry about an accident.  I have started to work out again...woo hoo.  I like steak and beer but have been trying to eat healthier.  I love to laugh and have been told I have a good sense of humor and a killer smile.

        Hi there!

I am going through a rough patch, and do not connect with most people (hardship or not) because I do not have children. I keep to myself and don't gossip. I am looking for a trustworthy and self-confident female friend who is out and  about in life doing her own thing. (I'm age 27-35). Please be self-confident, and for the most part, self-sufficient. Please also be in a non-attached state of existence (if you have children/partner - they are not 'accessories'). Essentially grounded, but always growing. 

 The wounds are deep, and my ex-partner's sister has tried to butt into our life because she is bored and lonely - she has done so unannounced. The nature of the hardship much revolves around this intrusion.  I will spare details on here. I have never been in such a predicament, as I am usually  doing my own thing and confront situations as they arise - as opposed to bottling stuff up. But life happens. and ""People who can't communicate, can't communicate.""

I try darn hard to see people as people, but there is an educational difference that creates a communication barrier in this situation.  If I don't do something soon, the sister and side fam will ruin me, as they are like vultures seeking prey and exhibit little discernment.  Logic would say to address concerns with each party, directly, but been there, done that. 

How did I get here? Well I gave someone a chance - suppose you never really know someone until you see them in a state of stress. When not around fam, the ex is like a whole new person (pun intended).  I'm very calm, do yoga, and meditate, and do not do well around people who belittle, shout, yell, and are not capable of setting and/or respecting boundaries.

I don't want to jump from the frying pan to the fryer and could use an objective third-party to provide non-judgmental, yet truthful insight and propose some real solutions. Not everything in this world is created equal. For what it's worth, I am not religious, but spiritual. So pragmatic, thoughtful, and somewhat spiritual advice is sough (i.e. no revenge seekers). 

Thanks for reading and I hope to hear from you!

I'm a nerd-inclined, open-minded, midwest-transplant hoping to make new girlfriends in the Seattle area.  I like comedy, anime, cartoons, art, music, people-watching, crafts, food, video and board games.  I also get really excited about anything to do with cute animals.

I'm also very interested in exploring the outdoors here and learning more about sustainable/green living.

I like being upfront and honest with people, but I also love sarcasm.

I don't understand sports, I don't like organized religion but I respect other people's choices as long as they respect mine.  I care about politics (liberal/socialist, feel the Bern!).   I am LGBT friendly and try to respect and understand all people :)

If any of this sounds appealing to you please respond with something interesting about yourself so we can start a dialogue.  I am only interested in platonic friendships so please no creepers!!!

        Why hello, everybody.

I am a nineteen-year-old male, and I'm going to ride my bike to central California in a couple weeks. I'll be going down the coast, camping out most nights, cooking for myself, carrying everything on my bike, etc. Probably average about 60 miles a day, three weeks in total. I'll be living in California for the summer, so that's where my trip ends, and you'd be on your own. You could come for the whole trip, or just a part of it. It's entirely up to you.

If you're interested in accompanying me, let me know. Male or female, it doesn't matter. Close to my age (let's say 18-28) would be nice. Preferably not creepy, sexual, or murderous. Just a regular human wanting to bike a thousand miles down the coast.

You'll need a bike, some bags, camping gear, food, etc. Everything you'd need to survive on your own for about three weeks.

I'll be going regardless. But having a cycling buddy would be cool.

Let me know! Tell me a bit about yourself, why you'd want to do this, what shape you think you're in, etc.

Have a nice day, and God bless!

        I am looking for someone to maybe talk to and get to know better. I fly through Seattle every two weeks and just looking for someone that I can do things with during my time there. I am married and I'm not looking to replace my wife, but I am looking for someone outside the relationship that would like to talk about things such as life, relationships, anything. Sometimes it's good to have and outlet that you can talk to vent to, get good advice from or constructive criticism. It don't matter if you are involved with someone, married, boyfriend, engaged, etc.. Everything that is ever talked about would stay between us and only us. If you like we can exchange pics at a later time once we get to know each other better and feel more comfortable. I'm not out to create drama for no one and hopefully you feel the same way.

 I know sometimes in a relationship you just wish you had that male friend that you can count on for things to talk to, cry to, vent to, comfort you and know that he really cares for you as a friend and will never do anything that would hurt you, then I'm the one. I'm looking for the same. So, if you are interested, please feel free to drop me some lines and introduce yourself and lets get to know each other a little better. I am a good listener, can hold an intelligent conversations, do have common sense, and open minded. Hit me up. Please put ""friendship"" in the subject line. Talk at you soon. :)

        Hello, thanks for stopping by. I'm a 46 yr old male looking for a female friendship, I don't care if you're single or married, skinny, thick, bbw, white, black, purple, alien or other. What I care about is personality.

Do you have a sense of humor, can you take a ribbing as well as give one? Are you open minded? Do you look at things and try to see the best?

I'm married and I've been with the same woman for the last 12 years. I'm not looking to change that, as I love her deeply, but the passion is gone, the dog gets more attention than I do. I miss that spark, that feeling when you look into each others eyes and the butterflies.

I want to start losing weight again and getting back into shape. I started a couple of years ago and was doing well, but after a knee injury, I slid back the other way. I live near Silver Lake and I've been thinking it would be nice to start walking around the lake again several times a week or even daily. It would be nice to have a companion to accompany me and perhaps we can get in shape together. It would also be nice to hang out once in awhile and watch a movie or just sit and talk. I'm currently self-employed and I'm flexible in my schedule, but most often have free time during the weekdays from 9:30 to 3:00 and occasionally on weekends.

I'd like a friendship where she understands my situation, perhaps is in the same. Someone who isn't looking to change my situation or me hers. If more develops beyond just friends, I'm not opposed, but I'm also not expecting. Friendship is really the more important factor, anything else is icing. I tried this several months back and met a couple of nice people, but one had opposing schedules, one got close to me and then apparently got  old feet and suddenly disappeared and one, who I thought was great after awhile admitted she didn't like kids and my son is everything to me. So no luck before, I'm trying once again as it's getting nice outside. 

So if you've made it this far, why not say hello. Perhaps we can chat a bit by email or kik and go from there. Please don't ask for a picture unless you're willing to send one as well, as I said personality is more important to me than looks. One can be a model, but if their personality sucks, they're going to be ugly in my eyes.

I'm getting a lot of spam/scam, so please change the subject to Cultured Pearl, so I know it's a genuine response. Hope to hear from you soon.

        what is strictly platonic? To me it's a friendship. But not one that always excludes sexual encounters. For me that is just the way it is.....

I love friendships. Being as those are the relationships I cherish the most. I've done relationships and I don't like them.  They end and they leave a bitter taste in your mouth. I hate feeling like that. The worst part is you loose touch with a really awesome person.

So this is were I post searching for another soul to enjoy life with. The courtesy of friendship has proven an attractive feature, but nothing beats a friend you can be yourself with.

I'm 420 friendly, like to go out or stay in with the right person. Let's chat about about something while enjoying life together. No strings attached freedom.

        I know this is a thing but I've never asked a stranger.

Do you want to cuddle?

I'm talking about laying/spooning on the couch together fully clothed.  Shoulder rubs could happen at some point by mutual agreement.  Either way I do like to touch so you should expect my fingers to be lightly caressing your arms or back.  Of course I wouldn't touch anywhere you didn't want it.
Since the whole point of this is comfort I'd suggest we meet first somewhere like a coffee shop and feel out each other's vibe.  If we could see ourselves relaxing with the other person then we can work on logistics. I can host.
Practically speaking; while I'm tall and slender the back rests don't come off of my stupid couch and we would both have to fit.  
As for what we'd watch.  I have Netflix and stream, don't watch reality tv or sports and other than that I'm open.

        Hello, I am interested in making new friends and going on new adventures. I recently moved back to WA and I realize I have been  staying home too often. Since the weather is going to be nicer it would be a good time to make some friends and get out more, see new things, meet some fun people. 

I'm 34, fairly active, I like to go jogging a few times a week, but I could be in better shape still. Looking forward to hiking, road trips, checking out events, drinks, good food, or whatever sounds fun. I work a graveyard shift, so my hours can be flexible still, either being awake during the day or evenings depending on what's going on. 

Feel free to reply with some info about you, what you're into. I do have a pic to share but I'd rather just share with someone who is more serious about meeting.

        ok here it goes 

I moved here from Ohio about a year ago.  I haven't met a single soul and don't see it happening naturally.  I am a super cool person but I rarely leave the house.  I am looking for friends who are interested in the same kind of stuff I am for great conversation and maybe eventually we could hang out.   I prefer to text but would rather chat a bit via email until i feel comfortable giving you my phone number.  Some day I would love to have a few friends to hang out with and actually see this beautiful state. 

So, if you like some of the following things and want a cool chick to talk to about them hit me up!!

Horror (shows, movies, books, art) 
Anything weird, strange, and/or dark 
Shows like Supernatural, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Walking Dead, The 100  
Movies like Star Wars, Terminator, Donnie Darko, Dogma
Anything Supernatural and Magical
Super heroes my favs are Superman, the Hulk, and Xmen
I am also very passionate about mary jane so I would hope you like that as well! 

so lets be friends

        I'm open to friendship with a woman of any age. I don't care if you are short or tall, skinny or plump, plain or beautiful. For me it's all about the ""personality"".

I'm not looking for a level of intimacy that you would normally have between a boyfriend and girlfriend at this point in time.  I guess I'm hoping to find a friendship with a woman where we become rather fond of each other, where we both look forward to the next opportunity of spending time together.

I have no hidden agendas, ulterior motives, nor am I into playing any kind of games. I'm simply looking for friendship full of fun and laughter, and hopefully finding someone who ends up becoming my ""Best Friend"".

Please put ""On occasion I can see Mount Rainier in the distance"" somewhere in your email and let me know how far away you are from downtown Bellevue and the year you graduated from high school as a means of better identifying spam email from real email.

Thanks for reading this posting and have a great week!

Chris
