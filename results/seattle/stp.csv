Bored as fuck at work. Hit me up on kik. 

Craigslist says this is too short. So I will tell a story to make craigslist happy. 

There once was a man named joe. Joe thought craigslists restriction on posts for their length was stupid. Joe then made a rant on Craigslist about the restriction. Joe was then banned from craigslist. Joe doesn't care. Because joe has a life. 

Be like joe.

I am a married white male with an desk job open to casual emails, maybe some flirting or possibly more. Just looking for that one woman who is sitting at home drinking coffee reading these ads for fun but doesn't usually respond. Marriage is ok but missing that spark or connection for many years. Would love to meet someone in similar situation who is open to talking but not sure they want to take it further. I have never been with another woman but not opposed to it with the right person. 
I am an attractive HWP man, down to earth, mid 40's, great sense of humor, witty and sarcastic at times. I can be a little shy at the start but if I feel a connection with someone I can open up pretty easily. Looking for similar in a woman.
Maybe just emailing, flirting, possibly meeting for coffee or ?. Hope to hear from you.

I'm looking for a buddy or hopefully a few buddies to chill and just be dudes with. Nothing weird, I'm not looking for a massage, a partner, some weird fetish... just friends. I'm a beer drinking, food eating, sports fan and video game playing straight dude. I don't have any problems with anyone who is gay as long as there is no expectations or needs in that department. 

I am 24 and on Craigslist because my friends are thinning out. Some of my friends have joined the military, got jobs in other states, ignore their friends when they start dating someone. You name it. I have a small group of friends and I'd like to be a bit more diverse when it comes to friends. I'm hoping to find someone close by or in the lynnwood area who's not a flake.

I'm a jokester who likes to laugh and make others laugh, I play games but I wish I had more time. I have a huge collection of video games that are on all the current consoles. I go to new breweries often because I enjoy trying new beers. I'm responsible, have a decent paying job for my age and no college education. I'm a good friend to have. I'm always there for my buddies if they need anything. I have a girlfriend and that's why I'm looking for guy friends. Not too many girlfriends like there boyfriends hanging out with girls.

Not that it should matter too much but I'm 5'10"" 180 pounds, average height and weight for the most part

Well I'm the man for the job! We can arrange a time to meet and set up the incidentals, or you can just inquire through email. My expertise behind the camera and you in front of the camera in exchange for free photos for you, and for myself that I use to build my portfolio. I will only use photos you allow me to use in my portfolio, and no photos are shared anyplace without specific written permission by you. I am not a professional, just a practicing hobbyist. That benefits you by having quality amateur photos being at no charge and for me just to sharpen my skills and enjoy a hobby. I mainly do on location, which means a place you arrange or set up.

So I travel the US and the world. Do it fairly regularly hence why I keep coming back to this state -there's so much to explore on day trips. Traveling in country I can still do on my own and do on a fairly/semi regular basis. I don't mind actually as I can explore on my own without time limits or other constraints from others. But I do like to travel with people when traveling internationally -if for no other reason than to be able to talk to another outsider ...and having another set of eyes and another brain doesn't hurt when trying to locate crap lol as well as making the overall trip cheaper. Anyway got some trips in the works -in both Asia and in Europe so hit me up if interested. Basically you pay for your way and I mine but I do have the Philippines pretty well covered if that temps you -it's a tropical island and my aunt owns a resort and I have family that lives over there... and food/drink is dirt cheap lol :)

It would be nice to fellowship with a young lady and see what happens. I live/work in Tacoma. Open to women of all ages and races. I'm active in my church and maybe we can visit each other's church. I enjoy sports, exercise, current events, movies, eating out, etc.

I guess you can say I'm fairly new to the area. I've been here for a couple years now and I have yet to make any real close friends. This is technically my first time being far away from all my family and friends I grew up with so in turn I don't think I even know how to make friends as an adult lol 
I'm a mom & wife and I am extremely happy in my marriage and I am only looking for friends not anything else. I feel I have to emphasize that point because I tried finding friends this way when we first moved here and it was a total disaster. The one girl I met and hung out with a few times essentially wanted a friends with benefits type situation so yea no. 😐
I'm hoping to find friends with kids maybe even kids around my kids ages. Although it's not a must. I have a 4 & 6 yr old. And if you haven't guessed it yet, I am a stay at home mom. I have recently begun using my YMCA membership for working out and not just somewhere to take my kids when I need a break. If you workout at the Y maybe we can workout together if our schedules coincide? I'm a very shy person at first but once I'm comfortable I'm a chatter box. I love movies, reading, shopping, photography, dancing, food, and a couple tv shows, I love getting massages and mani/pedis when I can. I do on occasion drink. I dont smoke anything. Im definitely a very family oriented person. I'm not a flake and one of my biggeat pet peeves is when people come to my house unannounced lol 
I know so much random info right? Just wanted to give a bit of what I'm about and what I'm like so if we have anything in common please email me!

My name is Christina, 33 yr old kinda newbie of Washington and p/s I hate this weather!

I must be out of my mind to think I'll meet a smart, attractive and truly funny woman on CL looking to befriend an attached dude for a platonic exploit. But what the hell. I'll either prove myself right after receiving replies from nothing but guys masquerading as women and hooker bots...or perhaps someone will prove me wrong. If you're here reading this, you'll know who you are. 

I'm late 40s, live and work in Seattle as a so-called ""professional"", am well educated, fit and married. Too much is missing in my day to day life to be truly satisfied and I'm hoping to make contact with someone in a similar situation who is looking for an outlet to share some giggles...or even tears. 

Why does attraction matter in strictly platonic? Because it just does, as much as I know that makes little rational sense! 

If you think we may be a good fit, drop me a note which says something about who you are and why this post intrigues you and let's see what happens next.

Hey hey - 

Hope all is well for you guys out there! I'm a 27 year old gay gamer looking for other fellow gamers. I mainly play RPG/Action/Fighter/FPS video games on consoles like PS4, 3DS/WiiU or my Vita. However, I have had quite an interest in board games recently. I've only played a handful of board games but would not be opposed to meeting others who are interested video/board games.

I've lived here for over a year and would like to expand my circle of friends. I'm a 5'8"" latino with a stocky build. I'd say. I can be very introverted at first but once I feel pretty comfortable, my true colors show. I absolutely love to laugh and make other laugh all the time :D 
I regularly 420 via edibles but smoke every so often, so if you're cool with that -- awesome!

I'm hoping to find friends who like to play multiplayer games like Smash Bros, COD, ect. I'd like a reason to get out of the house and chill/play video games.

Although this ad may be target toward other gaming buddies, I do not want to restrict it to just gaming. I also enjoy checking out Seattle, eating at new places, COOKING for others, shopping, walking around and just having all around fun.

I am also looking to find a friend I can be sexually open with. I don't have many friends that I openly talk to about sex. I would very much enjoy having a mate who would like to occasionally jerk off and cuddle. 

If this sounds like something you're looking for, drop me a line.

Just looking to meet people in Seattle. I live in North Seattle, Northgate, near Ballard/Shoreline. I like video games, cooking/baking, animals, hiking, fitness (although I'm expecting in July so I can't do any heavy duty lifting atm lol). I'm 420 friendly but don't smoke myself. I'm happily in a relationship and have a dog and cat. I'm pretty quiet until I get to know you but I'm also blunt and truthful. I'm not religious but don't care if you are as long as you aren't trying to convert me. I'm pretty open minded about a lot of things and hoping to find other people to hangout with who are as well. Whether it's just hanging out cooking and watching Netflix, playing games (board games, card games, and Xbox one), going for a workout, hiking with my dog..really anything. I'm thinking of learning how to knit and sow. I love DIY stuff and thrifting. Not big into shopping but do love a good bargain hunt!

Really just looking for other females who are layer back and looking for some Seattle buddies to hangout with!

Email me and if you have an Instagram you can definitely send that too so I get your vibe (I have one too) but either way just hit me up!

This may seem strange and is, but I have fathered three children during/in my marriage, Plus two or three others using my sperm to help relatives of my ex-wife. One was by invetro another was by eggs harvested and with a surrogate mother. The third time was kinda strange (on the cheap), my wife provided enough to a gay friend for a DIY. (I never asked how! But she also had a healthy child.)
So that is a total of six health children. I have lost or never had contact with the last three children, The youngest would now be in his/her late teens. I'm told, through other family connections that the three, from donor sperm are all highly intelligent and high achievers as are my own three sons.

A few years ago, my ex-wife contacted me about doing this again, I had my sperm tested and even in my 60s it still tested good. This donation never happened due to other family problems.

Why am I here? Over the past few months I have seen several posts here on CL for sperm donations and I have responded to several of them, offering mine. I have yet to have any takers and I can only assume it is because of my age. Well, you should talk with you fertility specialist and get their opinion. I know from my experience, it really doesn't seem to matter. 

I don't ask for anything and if you can afford the lab type invetro fine. Or, if money is tight, my sperm is freely given and you can DIY. (""if at first you don't succeed, try, try again!"") 

As I state above, I don't ask for anything, but really that would be irresponsible of me since I want the best for any child and since I have a choice here, I want make sure they will be born into a loving and happy home. And with all the opportunities my own natural children have. For that reason and at the parents option I want to offer to stay in touch with the parents and perhaps in time with the child. 

Think this over and if your seriously interest, just reply and we can discuss or have a Q&A on the details. (I'm not getting any younger but my Sperm is fresh daily!)

Are you sick and tired of not being able to find new opportunities to meet new peeps? Are you like me and feel secluded sometimes?
And have you wondered why skinny jean wearing dudes do the things they do, staring down at their phones, and not giving the respect of the presence of the person that they are with and not giving two pissies between the difference of 'reality' and the amount of instagram followers they have? Lets go for a walk at the park sometime!!!

K here's the deal. I'm in my late twenties. A hardworking honest guy who has been caught in the thick of the crowd, and lets face it we have all had it rough but I'm not looking for pity. I would like a sense of self-worth and genuine awareness of finding a friend outside of the crowd! 

I'm a bit old-fashioned, still behind the curve when it comes to the aforementioned technology. I get the lingo to facebook, twitter, etc. I choose not to have an account created for them. 

I like hanging out with my friends, netflix, chill time, rock climbing, watching all of the Quentin Tarantino movies from the past couple of decades, still like Pokemon, I also enjoy archery, play the guitar, have interested in subjecting my body to more pain treatment (haha I have a few tattoos so far...) and you will never meet someone like me based on my interests hobbies and personality!

Go ahead and feel free to respond to this if you dare muah-hahaha

Hello out there!! 

There comes a time in your life where you realize that you need a few great friends or that one best friend. This is what I am after. I am a unique individual who loves to be adventurous and dabble in all sorts of fun. I just noticed that all of my friends have a best friend, and I still don't who is local. I just seem to not feel a connection with anyone but it's not going to stop me from trying. 

About me- 

I am 38, I'm happily married (and by happily married, I truly mean that) I have two amazing boys who are the starshine and sunshine of my planet. We live in Tukwila and have been here for the last two years. We moved here from Oregon, so that is another reason why I am seeking friends on craigslist. I work full time during the week. 

I am terrible at this sort of thing. I am not an emailer, and it seems that most of the people that I do meet off here just want to email back and forth. I will not do that. I think my email limit is three, this is the first. . .
So if that is something that you plan to do, I am not your girl. With that said, I have recently figured out that I really need to have a connection before meeting up. I am spread pretty thin as most are, and meeting several people per week will just be too much. I will be down to meet up with someone I feel connected with, so it's going to have to be texts first. 

I have a gypsy soul. I'm eclectic, I am quirky and fun, but usually reserved at first. I am that person who would do anything for anyone. I am open and honest, non judgmental and completely mentally stable. I enjoy to be happy and in a great mood. I do not do well with over- negativity, mean spirited people or preachy people. Everyone says that they don't like drama, but I repel it. I am spiritual. This might sound odd, but agnostic -pagan (raddest thing ever would be for someone to get that). I am not going to change my mind, so I really don't want people to try for it bores me. Politics are just not my thing but this election tho!!! 

I am a music lover of all types (all kinds, but rap, r & b, bluegrass, folk and rockabilly are my right now favs (I am aware of the crazy mix), art, books, antiques, shopping, being girly, movies, nutrition, tattoo's, dancing, walking, collecting feathers, coffee & tea, gardening, concerts, succulents, jug bands, vaudeville. I love going to concerts when possible, small or big shows. I love anything vintage, rusty, musty and in bad condition. Antique shopping, thrift & book stores or walking the beach looking for driftwood is where you can usually find me. I am very into mindfulness and meditation. I love to wander downtown with my cuppa coffee in hand and explore new tasty foods & shopping. I am a girly girl, but not too willing to spend too much on maintenance. I'd rather do it myself. I love the written word, movies, dancing, adventure. I can cook something fierce, and love to entertain. 

I am very into nutrition. I am extremely happy with myself and even my body. However; I am trying to get into perfect health, and work out a lot. I am addicted to my fitbit. It would be nice to meet someone who is also working on that, while not having extreme body image issues. 

I am looking for someone who is like minded, kind, daring, fun. Between the ages of 30-40. Married or not, don't really care. Kids, great but mine won't be tagging along as they are older. I work 8-5 m-f. Don't care if you do or not, but those are my normal hours. l'd love to find someone willing to meet up, talk on the phone once in a while, and spend some good ol fashioned ""girl time"" with. I would love to meet someone up for dancing, concerts- shows, thrift shopping, garage sale-ing, going downtown, working out, seeing a chick flick. For me, life is too short for excuses, I like to live in the now. My only real requirement is that you must be in the same frame of mind for having a friendship. No sourpusses or chronically depressed, no fakes and most importantly be genuine. 

If you think I might be someone you could get along with, hit me up. I know my best friend is out there, so I'll keep posting this til I find her.

Thanks for reading.

Hi! 
I recently moved to Lacey and could use a chill, relaxed friend. I'm a girl who's down to earth, loves to learn, outdoorsy, and very goofy. You should be kind, open, funny, and smart. Oh and 420 friendly :) I don't drink hard alcohol, but wine and beer sometimes. I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 4 years.

I'm not materialistic, I'm more of a natural girl and health conscious. I like to crochet, sew, paint, and learn all types of new skills. 

I feel like I would be fine living like they did in the olden days, minus the dysentery. Haha. Just the idea of living off the land, making things myself, and being in nature seems peaceful.

I dislike mainstream media 
and music. I feel like it's dumbing down soceity.

I love spending time outdoors camping, fishing, vegetable gardening, beekeeping, and exploring nature. I love our mother earth and I enjoy being active. I am very much into being one with the earth. I really like walking barefoot when it's warm.

I'm not into partying, drama or gossip. I don't like being mean or negative. I like good vibes and creating good intentions.

I watch documentaries, learn about natural law, natural healing, health, nutrition, fitness, chinese medicine, native american cultures, psychology, physics, history, and science.

If you feel like we could get along, shoot me an email :)

Hey there! We are a glorious young adult trifecta looking for some quality friends. Our relationships to each other: two sisters, plus the partner of one sister. We thought we'd be upfront about the fact that we're mostly always together. All relatively new to the Tacoma area, we are having a hard time making connections organically outside of busy professional lives. It's difficult finding the space to meet people with similar interests when you are looking for friendship, not a romantic relationship.

Some interests of mine (the married sister) include cooking adventurous new recipes, going to new restaurants (recently we went on a doughnut crawl, followed by a slow quest for Tacoma's best pizza that we, my partner, sister, and I, could use some help on), seeing movies at The Grand Cinema, occasionally going to sporting events, always going to new breweries, running, slam poetry, and drag shows, among other things. I love Andrea Gibson, hard cider/IPA's, cheese, talking about film, and hosting dinner parties. Some of my favorite movies are Donnie Darko, American Beauty, Spotlight, Burnt, Doubt, The Other Sister, and Jaws. I'm honestly not huge into music, but I think this makes me a good ride-along buddy because I'm not picky about what's playing in the car. A few things I'd really like to do with a new friend would be to try a couple of the newer breweries in Tacoma, perhaps read a book together (mini-book club!), watch Netflix and bake stuff, and mainly, just get to know each other and support each other. I'm more interested in an actual consistent friendship than someone to have occasional crazy adventures with.

Some of my interests (I'm the sister/eternal third wheel) include movies, modern art, crafting, lindy hop, and antiques. My favorite movies are Fantastic Mr. Fox, Argo, Spotlight, and Her. I love crocheting and reading. I am a fan of beer and whiskey, and most foods. I am looking for fun meaningful friendships!

If you're looking for this pod of awesomeness, please shoot us a message with your favorite beer or cider as the subject line! We're looking for either groups or individuals to hang with.

I boast a love of board games that is way too high for my amount of friends. I'd also really like to get into MTG, but that require other people to play. Basically if you enjoy playing board/card games (it doesn't really matter what kind, almost all are super fun) and have time on your hands, feel free to send me an email. The ability to deal with snarky quips without getting offended is a major plus, as well as basically any other nerdy obsession possible to humanity, especially Star Trek. I'm very asexual, so I really mean strictly plutonic. I don't really care if you do drugs, but if its the biggest part of your personality and you can't hang out with anyone without getting high or talk about anything else, you might want to reconsider.

I am a pretty good looking guy if I say so myself, but I am a single father of two beautiful girls, that keep Daddy on his toes. I am not looking for anything sexual. Not looking for any emotional drama, I am just looking for a woman or women who are looking for the opposite male counterpart for going out, being that wingman for ya, and you can be my wingwoman for me. Bring your lady friends, thats fine, its all platonic. Again, I love being a father, its the best job ever, but sometimes, its fun to spend time with other company outside my current circle of friends, and outside my circle of work friends. 

Life is too short, I would just like to meet a woman or women who just want to explore something, groupon something, check out a movie, then go home back to our lives, grab dinner, catch up, then go home back to our daily lives..etc.. You get the picture.

Me... for the most part, just a regular single father, I work out, I am not a gym rat, but I do have muscles in the places that matter, meaning my brain! Ha! What were you thinking. Seriously, I work in IT, I am a nerd by day, goofy 24x7, have a home, car, two great kids, pay 90% of my bills, that toll bill is just killing me right now! Just a regular guy. Please care about your health, your looks, as I do. I am not perfect, and I don't need a barbie doll of a friend( but if you are, thats great too!), but it you like to work out and or do events like the tough mudder, or warrior dash, you can join me! The Warrior Dash is this July, I am training for it. They say opposites attract. I say they do, and I also say the same people attract, when its all about friendship. If you are just friends, it doesn't matter if you don't agree on topics, respect each other and what they believe, and keep it moving. Life is too short for drama. I am easy to talk to. I am non judgemental. I don't care what you did in your past, as long as it didnt involve hurting kids. Your past is your past, I wasn't there, so I don't have a right to judge your choices you make. I will always speak my mind and tell you my two cents. 

Repeat I am not in need of sex, I can get that elsewhere. Yes I am single, but I am not looking for sex from you(ya'll). I think that covers it..... Oh, and no I don't need you to come over to my house the first few times we meet. rather know the person that I am getting to know is sane!

Have a great weekend and rest of your week. Be safe.

Oh, and please be color blind, meaning race doesnt matter to you, cause it doesn't matter to me.

I'm posting here in the plutonic area because I realized after a few dates that I am not ready for jumping in and finding my next ex. I do miss adult companionship to go do things with. I work hard and would like to play hard too. My weekend consisted of going for a walk, going shopping, going out to eat, going to the casino just to have a drink and people watch and going to the movies... By Myself! Yes it's good to get out but it's embarrassing sometimes. People stare, feel sorry for me or I attract the ones who have liquor bravery, think I'm desperately lonely and have no standards or they see a neon ""come play me"" light with an arrow pointing my way. Sometimes when I go out I am reminded why I don't want to go out, well not alone anyways. I don't want to miss out on life and experiences and cool stuff and ""dating"" is not the answer for me at this time. I am not emotionally available for romance, right now it seems like ""the one"" for me just simply does not exist and I desire the impossible or just can't have my cake and eat it too. I accept this and live accordingly but someone to share things and experiences with is on my mind. I am a single white female, unique, attractive, good job, place, fun, loyal, sexy, no drugs, social drinks sometimes, 420 friendly... Thrill seeker but also like cozy relaxing moments... I don't date white men because I am not playboy centerfold material or a live flexi doll and Huh!? or Duh??? are not the biggest words in my vocabulary. I do have common interests like nature and hiking, camping, bonfires, music, BBQ, family, concerts, travel and road trips, festivities and more... There's just never a mutual physical attraction. Also, most black men I've met don't share my same passion for nature and thrill seeking and hate Washington and the weather. My personality is kind of eccentric, I like a well balanced mix of work & play, serious & silly and so on. Things I would like to do ""not alone"" are: travel, road trips, concerts, dinners, fairs and festivities, movies, roasting hot dogs and making smores... I really truly seek a trusting friend, partner in crime so to speak (not literally) and someone to confide in... vise sersa. Journey, explore, experience and take pictures- Lot's of pictures :) I want to go to Vegas in the very near future, a small group of fun girls and a man would be fun lol Also camping, I reserve the same spot every year for up to 12 people but this year I have only a few friends that may be able to go. I have looked into classes like cooking and photography & art and that meet ups thing but everything is so far and few in-between and I'm not looking to be a certified chef or own a $6000.00 camera. Can I just use my Samsung Galaxy!?? Something else I want to do is Geocatching- I tried once and had a blast! I also love the market (Pikes Place) I would like to discover other places to get fresh produce and unique herbs and spices... Spring and summer on the way- Lot's to do!!! And for Fall, my favorite! The colors and smells and coziness and HALLOWEEN!!! I like all holidays actually and am a go all out person too. I think I just need trusting friends and day by day things just seem better and then one day when someone asks how you are and you reply ""good"" you actually mean it :)

Im also obsessed with Batman ^o^

-no, I wont hack someones fb for you (I get asked a lot)

Here's a little about me: I have no children but do enjoy them. I have two Boxers that I spoil rotten. I like to cook more than baking, but do both. I enjoy taking spontaneous weekend trips and most day trips. I have a passion for learning and am always interested in new and different things. I love going to fairs and festivals, reading, second hand shopping,, binging on Netflix, taking care of my chickens and turkeys. I enjoy doing crafts and have quite an extensive supply of materials for making greeting cards and other paper crafts. I live on a 20+ acre timber tree farm between Snohomish and Granite falls. I spend time gardening with herbs, vegetables, flowers and fruit trees. I am currently planning the spring garden and potting seeds to start indoors. I am from Los Angeles, corporate America, and relocated to WA 9 years ago. I'm 54 but on most days I feel younger or older, but then again, what does 54 feel like? 

I am hoping to find friends with shared interests who just want to spend some time enjoying life. If we have interests in common send me an email and ler's have some fun.

Hi,

So, I'm the guy that shouldn't be on Craigslist. Why, you ask? What makes me so special? 

Well.. I have a doctorate degree, I'm fairly attractive, social, generally good with women (although my game has taken a hit here in Seattle, I mean c'mon, the dating scene here stinks), I'm financially well-off, I'm not married, divorced, kids, or STD's. Hmm. Sounds like a decent situation huh? I'm cool too. I might not participate in certain shit-shows (because of my career), but that doesn't mean I won't cheer you on. I let you be you. The best you. 

I'll be honest, socially I'm generally ""the man"" in other places I've lived but I've struggled a lot in Seattle. Maybe blame it on the freeze? I don't know. But that's why I'm here.

You:
You feel guilty for being on craigslist, or maybe you don't but your friends would feel guilty for you. You KNOW you could do so much better. And not because you live in Bonney Lake with your 2nd child on your arm, and you're bored because you've been out of work for a year and you're ""so"" done with this town. No no dear, you just need to find a new hobby. The type of woman I'm talking about, this woman... she KNOWS she shouldn't be on craigslist because you have a graduate degree (or are in a well secure career with your bachelors), you're attractive, independent, you're healthy and cool, and maybe like me you're struggling a bit meeting friends or people that inspire you.... Well until you read this. Because that's over now. So, Hit me baby, one more time! I'm waiting for you. 

Race doesn't matter. Clearly I'm black. So minorities are cool, and cool white people are cool too. :) Age 24-35? I think that's fair. Big booties to the front of the line. Awesome wing women will tell others to get IN-LINE. 

Send a pic or no reply! :)

So here's my story...

I'm 36 year old comedian that is also a stay at home dad because of a child with severe autism. I also do a bit of acting. My wife has encouraged me to seek out a best friend, due to the fact the last two I thought were that person ended up not having the qualities of being that.

I have more female friends than male, I just prefer it because I understand women (raised by my aunt and grandma) and am such a loving person.

About me:
- Funny 
- Loving 
- Honest 
- I don't believe in breaking promises 
- I'm am affectionate towards people I love (hugs and cuddles) 
- Love Movies
- Loyal
- I'm drama free (I'm a good guy, and my wife trusts me and likes all my friends) (Also she at one point made a serious suggestion about becoming a professional cuddler, she knows)
- No, I don't want anything more than a bestie (no side chicks, FWB, or etc)
- I always open to a variety of stuff, but because of the complexity of my daughter, I don't bring people over for her comfort.
- Love Karaoke 
- Don't Smoke of anything, but do socially Drink (If you smoke or 420, that's cool, I just don't)

There's so much more, but I want to hear some about you first. Be serious about wanting a bestie, I have friends. 

Send a pic and tell me about yourself. Put your favorite TV show in the subject. So I can delete the spam.

Talk Soon,

Love trips to goodwill, Obsessed with sugar gliders and own 2. Not afraid of laughing at myself. 

fav tv shows: the walking dead, Outlander, Gilmore girls, New Girl, love DIY network show, I like cheesy shows like ""married at first sight"", Love a lot of comedy but blanking on which ones haha. 

fav movie: never been kissed and cry baby 

boyfriend is an ex-skater boy, likes playing GTA on xbox, and watching scary movies, playing football for fun with some coworkers, soon to start a 2 year mechanics program, likes to pretend he can rap and sometimes tries to make music, he's from the east coast, likes making jokes and a super genuinely nice guy.

And meeting ladies in public? Its very hard when you are a little shy at first. There has to be a lady out there somewhere looking for a active, fun, oldschool, hopeless romantic? But where where????

I grew up in a small town and attended a Baptist Church like many other good little boys. This extraordinarily precocious girl, C. S., also attended the church. I knew her all through junior high and high school. She wore these exceedingly tight skirts, nylons, and heels, tight knit blouses too. Since our preacher had convinced us that we were going to roast in hell for our wayward thoughts, mine seemingly, inevitably, became even more stimulated, wayward, and elaborate. I still remember the parties where she wore similar things, perhaps even tighter fitting, than she wore in church. She would sit on my lap and I would rest my hand on her textured nylon legs. I suspect she knew full well what was going on beneath her.
I wish that I could go back to that time and place knowing what I know now.
Any C.S.'s out there who always wanted to make it with the smartest, most sought after, best athlete in town? who went on to the big city and to some very rewarding things but who has always had you in the back of his mind somewhere, wondering if you were feeling the same thing he was all those years? Perhaps still are? Even platonically. Then there was S. S. and K. S. too.
Appreciation and/or quid pro quo's of all sorts considered.
Take me back and forward. Hint: small logging town; G. Creek

Looking for women who are interested in vaginal massage. Yes, I am serious about this. I've placed this ad in the strictly platonic section because I was getting undesireable responses in the casual encounters section. I am not looking for a sexual hookup. Please read further and I will explain everything. If you are under 30 years of age, please do not respond.

I want to provide as much as possible a professional vaginal massage. I won't be massaging/stimulating you in any other way. If that's what you're looking for, move on. A typical session would last 30 to 45 minutes. I will be massaging the inside of the vagina only, avoiding the glands of the G-spot and the A-spot. No external massage will be done or should be expected by you. It WILL NOT be my intention for you to have an orgasm. That is not the goal. The goal is to massage all around the vaginal walls to increase tone of the muscle. The massage will start gentle and increase in intensity. However, I will never use more pressure than what you want. I will be using latex or nitrile gloves (if you're allergic to latex). And I will be using a water based lubricant of your choice that you need to provide.

There are specific benefits of vaginal massage. The vagina is a muscle and without regualar ""exercise"" (not just sex, but helps) it can atrophy. Massage increases blood flow to the pelvic floor, increases vaginal moisture, may boost your libido, prevents shortening of the canal and prevents thinning and narrowing of the walls.

I know this might be a difficult thing for you to participate in. But, I will try to make you feel as comfortable as possible by keeping the setting and atmosphere as professional as possible. You will need to prepare yourself for the massage by being as relaxed as possible. The session will start with some deep breathing exercises to help you relax. I do not expect anything in return, except your feedback of the massage experience.

I cannot host. The massage must be done in your home. I will not travel out of the local Lacey/Olympia/Dupont/Tumwater area. An open space of approximately 10 by 8 feet must be available (in your home) to set up the table. I will bring the massage table. You must provide a set of twin sheets and pillowcase for the table. You must provide the lubricant of your choice. If your home is not an option and you would like to do the massage in a motel room, you must pay for the room.

Please, serious inquires only. No flakes, no games and no BS. I won't put up with it. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. Thanks for reading.

I am pretty open-minded, love movies, and I am getting back into reading regularly. I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree, where I'm an economics/philosophy/political science major. Running is something I am re-learning to do (I was previously an avid runner), and I am training for a couple 5Ks. I savor the experience of food, especially Thai, where I cannot resist a good plate of pad see ew or pad kee mao. I'm learning to cook and I like comic books, so I have a few geeky moments.

I enjoy witty banter, have hobbies, and genuinely ask questions, so conversation will never be short.

PLEASE be a reliable person who follows through after emailing. Include where you are (city/neighborhood), a bit about your personality and interests, and days/time windows you're generally available to socialize. PLEASE ATTACHED paragraph below.

Do you love nature and getting out into it? Art and music? Let's meet at a cafe for a conversation or get out for a park walk and chat on a good weather day and go from there.

People who are adventurous, will try new things and are curious about life in general are my favorite types of friends. My interests include almost anything that's outdoors in decent weather - good walks and hikes; having a good conversation; musical events; good movies, plants/gardening and public gardens and other cultures. 

Indoor pursuits like conversation over coffee, museums, dinner, talks, hearing music of many types and the like are great when the weather may not be cooperative. I'm a non-smoker (you too, please) and occasionally have a wine or drink. We don't need any of this to have a good time, however. 

I'm a truly good person, have a sense of humor, and am a good friend who remembers birthdays, pays attention to what friends say. I'm also an empathetic person who will help friends in whatever way I can whenever I can. I'm reliable and look for other people who are too, as well as people who are kind, good people who have most of those qualities. Nobody is perfect, of course.

Otherwise, I look forward to hearing from you soon! [Sorry, not looking to meet married people or couples. It doesn't generally work out that well.]

Things that I like to do: I love live shows of all kinds (plays, comedy, opera, concerts, restaurants with live music, etc.), science (especially archaeology, and astronomy), museums, the beach, Sunday afternoon trips, cozy warm snuggling by the fire, good wine, ethnic restaurants and dancing. Hoping to spend some of the winter months in Hawaii or Arizona in three years when I retire. Want to visit Egypt and Italy, and would love to explore the U.S. in an RV someday (I especially love the Southwest). I am happy, secure and independent. I love going out with my friends and won't give that up, but miss the companionship and affection of a man. Most importantly, we both love to laugh! If you think you want to try to make me laugh, tell me something about yourself and send me a photo. I will send you a photo and more about myself, if I think there will be a connection. PLEASE no drugs, no alcoholics, no diseases, no smoking and have employment or a secure retirement.

Hi, thanks for reading my ad. E mail me if you'd like a guys point of view on whats going on in your relationship , if you would like to know what a guy you know is thinking or if you'd just like to know why guys do what they do. We aren't that complicated but I guess sometimes women try to figure men out using their logic when we (men) think in an entirely different way. I would love to help you out and at least give you some ideas on what your guy is thinking. This is just me giving you my thoughts and advice nothing more. I don't even live in your town and i wont be bugging you to meet or a date or anything like that. Take care

My interests include almost anything that's outdoors in decent weather - good walks and hikes; having a good conversation; musical events; good movies, plants/gardening and public gardens; little road trips, and lifelong learning about all types of things including other cultures. Indoor pursuits like conversation over coffee, museums, dinner, talks, hearing music of many types and the like are great when the weather may not be cooperative. I'm hoping you share some of those interests and also want to meet someone who will share some of your unique interests and offers mutual support. I'm a non-smoker (you too, please) and occasionally have a wine or drink. We don't need any of this to have a good time, however. 

I'm a truly good person, have a sense of humor, and am a good friend who remembers birthdays, pays attention to what friends say, and tells them about news or activities I think will interest them. I'm also an empathetic person who will help friends in whatever way I can whenever I can. I'm intelligent, but not intellectual, have a spiritual side but am not religious. (No proselytizers, please) I'm reliable and look for other people who are too, as well as people who are kind, good people who have most of those qualities. Nobody is perfect, of course.

PLEASE NOTE: Please email and include where you are (city/neighborhood), a bit about your personality and interests, and days/time windows you're generally available to socialize. Please be close to the boomer age range and in the areas posted in the first paragraph above. If you'd like to send along your number in addition to a self-description to shortcut things, you can definitely trust me with it. 

If you're fit enough to get out for at least brisk walks, that would be great. I'm fairly fit for this age. I was born elsewhere, have been in the Northwest more than half a lifetime and have interest in meeting people from everywhere. If you're overly concerned with superficiality over substance, we very likely would not be compatible. Otherwise, I look forward to hearing from you soon! [Sorry, not looking to meet married people or couples. It doesn't generally work out that well.]

Hi. So this is kinda like an all time low posting here to connect with someone lol. I thought I'd just try anyway to see what the responses would be like. I don't really use craigslist for dating but figure what the hell. I don't get out much and so I guess it would be nice to kinda meet someone "" electronically"" lol. I am a down to earth, chill and funny kind of person. I don't take life too serious but I do have things going for myself. I own my own home, work hard and have a decent car :). I love movies, books, music, any kind of sports except for baseball. Don't ask why just watch and you'll see for yourself. Anyway, I may just leave it at that. I don't know what to really expect but I am guessing a few replies. My only thing is please don't be a smoker or a heavy drinker. Huge turn off for me and if you are then no disrespect but we won't even come close to being close friends. I just don't like that image and I feel that everyone should be smart by now not to smoke. Have a good day and maybe we'll chat?

Hi and thanks for reading. You must be somewhat interested since you clicked on this :). I am single now for about 6 months and I am looking to get back into meeting and seeing where things go again. I am a busy guy and don't get a lot of chances to go out so I figure why not try this and see anyone responds. I am in a good position in my life right now as far as job, house and friends. However, it's nice to have someone special around and have someone to go out with/share all that. My main turn off is probably going to be you being a smoker. I just think it's nasty and I really don't want to be around that. No offense. I don't discriminate hehe. I am looking for someone fun, creative and real. I like to have nice long conversation over coffee and do things that regular people do I guess. I am into a lot of things but won't mention them here because then you'll know everything there is to know about me lol. That is not the point here. Anyway, please be cool, nice, in somewhat decent shape since I am fit. I'd like to know that you take care of your body and that you are somewhat active as well. A huge plus if you like sports. Anyway, I am not doing much tonight just kinda hanging out. Let me know if you'd like to chat. I am 27 btw!

I have no one. No friends. No family. Ive always only had a few close people in my life at a time but now I'm at a point where those friendships have ended and now I have no one. I am only looking for a friend who is in the same boat and barely has anyone in their life as well. I am not looking for your pity, I am not looking for a group of girls to be friends with. I am generally a pretty shy and reserved girl who doesnt like crowds of people, and really I dont like many people at all. Its hard for me to make friends. I have social anxiety. I just want to find one or two best GIRL friends. I want to be your #1 person where we do everything together like best friends do. I know what I want out of life but i'm not really on the right track right now and could use some motivation and/or company. I'm up for doing whatever with the right friend, except for going to bars/clubs/parties/drugs/sex, etc. One of my main goals is to travel. Please be a GIRL, 18-30 yrs old, and in the same boat as me.

Hello!

First off I am 29, very happily married, and would never change or hurt that, but I really enjoy getting to know new people, that are okay keeping it platonic, or risking any harm to anyone's relationship. I am also from Texas, and enjoy getting to know people from other areas as it removes the pressure to meet if there is a connection, and keep relationships safe. 

I work from home most days, which also means I don't do much on those days, and it would be great to have someone new to get to know and share things with. I'm very open minded, goofy, extremely laid back, I don't judge, I'm allergic to drama, I can be really sarcastic but I know when to turn it off, easy to talk to, and I've had an interesting and unique life so far, so I think I have quite a few interesting things/stories to share. I also have a bit of a dirty mind, and might throw a ""that's what she said"" into a conversation at some point. I am also a major night owl, so if you are too, even better!

I am looking for someone who is: intelligent, funny, witty, understands sarcasm, open minded, non-judgemental, dirty minded, drama free (although venting is allowed), easy to talk with, and just fun. 

Again not looking to meet or change anyone's relationship, just looking for fun conversations to get through the day or night. 

Hope you are having a great day and I'm looking forward to chatting with you!

We live in Portland, but I've accepted a job in South Park, and I am looking to meet people, get to know South & West Seattle, & scout a place for my fam to join me, come June. I keep bees, chickens & fruit trees at our home here in Portland, and I am passionate about eating good food, eclectic music, healthy living & my kids.

We met playing Ultimate frisbee and love all manner of outdoor adventure, we'd enjoy introducing the kiddos to more climbing indoor & out. I was a stay@home parent for four years we have a van, but prefer a lifestyle where we go weeks not using it for kid transport. I am in the marine field & mama is in the birthing arts. In the summer, we line dry our laundry, picnic and find water to recreate on. We buy food in bulk and try to DIY everything at least once. I soak/sprout, ferment and dehydrate foods. The kids and I are vegetarian, I like to read about dietary & health topics, and we aspire to sustainable Traditional/SCD/Whole30 cuisine at home.

We'd love another ""larger"" fam to hang with who has similar life pursuits in S/SW Seattle. I am also looking for a place to stay between 27th/Mar and end of May, if you know of a temp rental, see my cl ad# 5481106589

As time goes I feel as if I will never have a best friend because I never have the time to have only one friend to share life with while laughing about dumb things or going out to watch a movie or even a casual ""date"" with. Saying this doesn't mean I don't have friends because I do, I have a lot of friends but not a best friend for sometime now. I been so consumed with school and work worrying about my future I forgot to live in the present. I been putting friends aside for the longest time. I get along with girls the best and having a girl best friend does not mean I want sex. No just someone that can grow on me and share our time together as friends I'm not in a rush to be in relationship but as time goes who knows.

I'm going to keep this pretty short and to the point. I want to become someone's slave. I want to work for someone, live with them and have them keep all the money I earn. If they want to keep me at home, I hope they would have me working full time at their house doing anything and everything they want me to do. I don't want to be a submissive, I want to be a slave, completely and permanently owned.

Hi. I am what you would call a recluse. I do not have any friends so here I am looking to make some. I am happily married and do not want anyone who thinks that they can make me cheat on him. Not going to happen.


I will insert a photo. Looking for men, women, straight, gay, does not matter. Just looking for people I can go out with, see movies, yadda yadda yadda.

Do you feel a sense of masculinity/manliness/empowerment when you go shirtless? I'm not looking for anything linked to sex, it's the excitement of shirtless in itself.

So here's the thing: I am trying to get out into the world as much as possible. My close friends moved away to different parts of the country, and the ones in the area have been so busy with their own lives. I too have been kept busy with work and school, but things are beginning to settle, and I have a feeling that it would be nice to meet new people. Who does not like making new friends?

I am pretty open-minded, love movies, and I am getting back into reading regularly. I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree, where I'm an economics/philosophy/political science major. Running is something I am re-learning to do (I was previously an avid runner), and I am training for a couple 5Ks. I savor the experience of food, especially Thai, where I cannot resist a good plate of pad see ew or pad kee mao. I'm learning to cook and I like comic books, so I have a few geeky moments.

I enjoy witty banter, have hobbies, and genuinely ask questions, so conversation will never be short.

I honestly can't think of a good title, so if you read through this and it's not for you, please- no emails about how I wasted your time. 

I'll try my best to describe what I'd like, but I think the right person will understand. First of all, I""m not looking to meet. Where I am is not particularly relevant, but let's just say it's way too far for a meeting, even if I was interested. Basically, I'm looking for conversations that are outside our daily lives, the stuff you wouldn't normally voice out loud. This encompasses so many things, which I'm not going to list, but let's just say I speak my mind, No topic is off limits or ""too soon"" if it's funny. 

For the most part, I miss laughing. I had an on-line friend for about two years, and we used to have a lot of these weird conversations- and about our daily lives too- but I mostly miss those random, uninhibited thoughts that showed me who he really was. That's my take on it anyway- most of what we show the world on a daily basis is the version of ""us"" that is socially acceptable. I'd like to find someone who accepts me even if it doesn't always sound safe or sane. I'd like to do the same for you.

If you think this is for you, please feel free to introduce yourself, and include the same stats I've listed about myself in this ad. Oh, two things: 1) Please be a decent writer, who will write more than two sentences of ""text speak"". I will not respond to one- two line emails, or retarded questions like ""Are you real?""; 2) Please have time to write more than once in a blue moon. I think once a day is reasonable, given all the responsibilities we have at home and work. It could be more on some days, but if you expect frequent emails every day, I'm not the one.

Finally, please don't be offended if I don't respond. It's not personal, it's Craigslist. In any case, thank you for taking the time to read my ad.

I moved here last year and would like to meet some people--possible new friends. I am easy to be with and talk to---also fun.

I enjoy hiking out in nature, walking anywhere, reading, movies, cafes--coffee and tea---want to meet for a coffee?, lunches out--want to meet for lunch?, dinners out, yoga, healthy eating, music, concerts, poetry.
I have a degree in communications and have been reading recently about the importance and value of relationships and friendships. I think many today don't enjoy either enough. And so, would you like to meet and / or do something together? I'm open and available.

So yeah, seeking a metal/rocker chick. Don't really care what you look like as long as you like the music and would love to check out the local venues and concerts with me. I can be wild -love moshing and raves but don't look like it and can act quite normal when I choose. My only requirement beyond loving the music is being fun -you don't have to be Five Finger Death Punch energetic or whatnot ..you can be Nirvana or whatever low key mellow. I myself love all kinds of tempo and get moved by the music and fellow attendees. So it's not like I'll thrash to Pink Floyd lol ...I really want to check out Laser Floyd in fact. Anyway hit me up if you like metal and/or rock or vice versa. I'm looking to go to Sabbath in September.

Hey there, Im really finicky with people in general, I literally talk to two people in person in my life, my gf and best friend. I keep trying to make a second friend but its really hard for me. I hate most people, I dont get along with them nor care for more friends really, but its hard feeling so shut off from the world sometimes. I also seem to attract a lot of sociopathic people, And im extremly sick of them, so if youve been called one, please dont bother me. Ive tried having compassion for them because thats considered a disorder, but im done doing that and feeling bad for people who get off on fucking other peoples lives over, my empathy is far better used on people who arent the REASON the world is so fucked up I dont even leave my house unless I have to. 

Anyways, I tend to rant about the shit world a lot, I live with chronic illness- I have a connective tissue disorder so some days are harder to get around then others, but I can do cool tricks like the bendy pics in this post ha. Also have schizoaffective disorder which makes me a bit extra paranoid of people and reclusive. Im an artist.. I feel like Im writing an ad for a dog with issues or somehting ha. I dont know how to communicate with people on the ""socially acceptable level"" The whole hi how are you?- oh Fine you? - I hate idle chatter and how we all just go through these shit fucking motions in life, never really tapping into eachother on a human being level. Im not a robot, and I feel like nearly every person I talk to in public are just empty shells on autopilot, its creepy and reminds me why I almost never bother to seek any other people in my life out. 
Anywhat, preferably Id like someone around my age- though I usually get along with way older people a ton better, I think id be more nervous to met someone whos like 70 online ha. In person I see to get along with them better then most shit nose young people. I may be eccentric and look like that type of person, but Ive been told by even my own family that Im like an old man about things. Ha and then I even sometimes use a walker hahaha, Im not your average person lets just say.

I have posted on here a couple of times before just looking to meet someone new. I lead a pretty busy life between work and being a single dad to a teenage daughter. This makes it difficult to get out and meet anyone new so I thought I would try this. As I said looking for just friends which is why I am posting here. I know that I can be a little shy at first, but I open up pretty easily once I get to know someone. I am looking for someone who just likes to tLk whether it be email or text or getting together for a coffee or drink. Maybe grab a movie every once in a while or just get together to talk about what's going on and life in general. If this sounds interesting I look forward to hearing from you.

I'd like to meet a nice lady and I mean LADY who likes to chat over coffee or a glass of wine in the evenings a couple of times a week. I'm am extremely busy person and rarely have time to meet people. On occasion I'm able to leave work early and I find myself not tired enough to go to bed so I drive around looking for something exciting to do but its never fun when you are alone. I have absolutely no interest in sex or marriage but a good friend to unload the daily drama. Just someone to chat with. I like going to dinner, movies, sharing a bottle of wine, and if not too tired a dance or two isn't out of the question. I enjoy art in almost every form, politics but don't like to bring it up unless we are 100% compatible in that department. I've done quite a bit of travelling , usually off the beaten path with little funds so I have a bunch of anecdotes we can share. I'm a good listener and enjoy hearing others play their tape. So if this is something that piques your curiosity drop me a line. Again NOT interested in sex, not gay either but I just have to know someone very well before anything happens or at least year from the time we meet. 

Adios!

Hello there :) I've tried this a few times, but after the initial meeting, it kinda fizzles out. Besides a few girls, but they are so busy with their own lives, I don't see them as often as I'd like. (I totally appreciate them though, they are super awesome). But lately I have been super lonely. I have always had a hard time keeping friends. Even in childhood. I just want someone to call my best friend (Besides the boyfriend). Someone who I can just chill with or have a shoulder to cry on or talk about boy problems or whatever. Anyway, below I will post some information about myself. 

*I am 27, almost 28.
*Have worked in childcare since I was 13. 
*I have a boyfriend. We have been together for almost 3 years. And we do live together. 
*Huge nerds.
*Between the 2 of us we have Vita, PSP, PS2, PS3, PS4, Gameboy Advance SP, DS, Gamecube, Snes, Nes, Wii, XBox 360, Steam Link, and PC. So we love us some games. :)
*Watch shows like The Walking Dead, GoT, X Files, HIMYM, Once upon a time, and so many more shows. The list would never end. 
*Loves me some movies too. I have about 400 dvds and its slowly growing. 
*Huge bookworm. Mainly Young Adult, Science Fiction, Fantasy, Classics, Historical Dramas. 
*We are also wrestling fans. I mainly love the Attitude Era, but I still love it all. (WCW, ECW, WWF/E)
*Love to watch Anime. Again, that list would go on forever. But some of my favorites are Dragon Ball/Z (I pretend GT doesn't exist, I thought it was done poorly), Elfin Lied, Full Metal Alchemist, Sword Art Online, DeathNote, Future Diary, Welcome to the NHK, and so many more. 
Just an all around nerd :)

So if you'd like to chat, just email me. 

Not sure what else to say. If you think we would connect, let me know. Thank you for reading :) 
To weed out spam, put your favorite anime, book, or musician in the subject. Thank you.

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag drifting through the wind...

But seriously....maybe Katy Perry is onto something. 

Music speaks to me. I've been through a lot in the last couple of years. I'm not ready to date right now and I'm not looking for someone to hook up with. I would like to find a man to talk to and be friends. Hang out with. Eventually maybe we can date if things line up. 

I'm not looking for someone who is married or otherwise unavailable or someone way older than me. I'm 30, so you should be in your 30s too. Children and race don't matter. I would like to find someone that I'm intellectually compatible with that we can talk about real issues and the world but also just laugh about stupid stuff too. 

Send me a picture and tell me something special or unique about yourself.

Hey there,

I moved to Seattle a few months ago and work full time, so I've had trouble meeting anyone to talk to or hang out with. That's my deal. I don't really know anyone here and would like to do something about it, so here I am.

I'm a thirty year old male, but I look younger. Baker by trade. I'd describe myself as kind of shy, but really smart. Friendly, considerate, respectful, caring, adventurous. I have eclectic hobbies. Everything from super nerdy stuff, to the arts, to the outdoors. I like trying new things too.

I'm single, but not looking for a romantic relationship, so I don't feel like it's appropriate to describe myself physically. Suffice to say that I try to take care of myself. I don't really know what I'm looking for in a friend, but I'd say honesty is incredibly important to me. I think I'd like to surround myself with positivity and/or intelligence.

Hit me up. Ask me anything you want, tell me about yourself, whatever. You can always decide that it's not a good fit and I wont be offended. Without that first email we'll never know though, will we?


Have an awesome day either way,

-Dain

Also a pool player where grandma taught me everything I know and enjoy my whiskey and coke, although not an alcoholic. Prefer not to talk to the police dept. on the way home.

Looking for some new friends and fresh perspective. I am 33 years old.I have spent the greater part of the last 10 years in a monogamous relationship. Out of that I gained two awesome kids. I have spent the last 3 years or so clumsily stepping in and out of the dating scene. I have been through my ""manwhore"" stage, my ""I want another long term partner"" stage and now seem to be in a ""JADED"" state. I have come to the conclusion that this will pass although it's going to take some doing on my part.

So, here I am on Craigslist. . . 

I am into Metal Music and play bass in a metal band that gigs often.
Thats not where my musical taste stops but it definately takes up most of the pallet.
I like outdoor activities such as, but not limited to Sking,fishing,hiking,bonfires, bbqs,biking,swimming,floating rivers and just enjoying nature.
I have a ""Moderately inappropriate"" sense of humor. 
I may or may not offend you but one thing is for sure. I speak my mind.
I am no longer the manwhore I once was and I am STD frrrreeeeee.! (Recently tested)

I am not looking for naked pictures or sexting.
I will also not turn either down 
I will not instigate these activities


I am an open book with many blank pages 

Im open to any type of conversation.

I'm here to make friends first off. I guess this is where I brag ""yourself"" well here it goes.

I'm told I'm not hard on the eyes that is if you wear bi-focals and legally blind in one eye.

i'm just a down to earth guy with a corky sense of humor. If you laugh hard when someone trips or you think old people are cool then skip the blah blah ,yada , yada, yada and we should already be chatting. Oh yeah I don't have a criminal record either something everyone should be asking everyone online don't ya think? Lol

I am looking for perhaps a platonic female partner of any age for this. We will see about doing this weekly..one coffee, or massage ;) at a time, but no expectations. I am fun, funny, and down right witty sometimes, I've been told. Also, clean cut, nice, gentle, ddf and ""a genuine great guy"". I can do a great Deep Tissue massage or a wonderful light touch Swedish massage. Reciprocation would be nice, but what ever YOU Like. Its up to you!

You feel your body being spun around, and immediately your face is in your pillows, as your arms are forced behind your back and bound. With his weight on top of you, you can't move. He grabs your hair to lift your head. You open your mouth to scream, but quickly find it stuffed with a ball gag, which is quickly secured at the back of your neck. You feel your panties being yanked down your legs and past your feet.

You lay there, on your stomach, with his weight on your back, holding your down, unable to move. You know he's going to fuck you right here, so you decide to lay motionless in the hope that he will finish quickly and leave. But instead, you feel yourself being lifted from the bed and half-carried, half-dragged over to a desk.

He bends you roughly over the desk, so your feet are still on the ground, your stomach and face are pressed up against the desk and your pussy and ass are hanging in mid-air, waiting for him to take you. You realize, shockingly, that you are wet. Not just a little, but dripping wet. Your brain screams that it doesn't want him inside of you, but at the same time, the rest of your body desperately does. Fortunately, you think, you probably won't have to wait too long for that to happen.

You feel the bindings keeping your wrists behind your back loosen. He roughly grabs your arms and places them over your head. You feel rope tightening around your wrists, and as you test the new bindings, you realize you're attached to the desk now. Moments later, you feel similar bindings around your ankles, spreading your legs wide.

Now strong hands take their place at your hips. You feel pressure against your sopping wet pussy. You take a deep breath, knowing your body is about to be invaded by his hard cock.

. . .Reply with ""What Happens Next"" so I know you're real. Don't forget to include a few pics.

I'm always there for friends, and I've been known to answer the phone in the middle of the night. I'm a great listener and enjoy helping people navigate through tough times and love celebrating the good times. I don't miss events that are important to close friends and sometimes acquaintances. But it seems that things don't always go both ways. I know who the reliable people are and of course they are a high priority, but sometimes I just help too much when maybe I shouldn't.

Of course the obvious answer is to keep being there for people and know when to cut people off. But it it gets old sometimes, right? 

Anyway, tell me what you think. What's on your mind? And if you have something completely unrelated and need to talk, I enjoy listening. I just can't put my number on here because I'd get some strange calls from CL people, I'm sure. And no, I'm not ugly :P

I don't mind hosting, but I'd rather meet somewhere first so we're both sure we're cool with it. Prolly won't be hanging when the wife is home. We pretty much hoard our time together. She don't partake though sadly.

I like to cook(a lot), gaming, movies, riding quad, shooting off few rounds out back. What ever really. I'm super easy going. Hmu if you're interested.

Anything else just ask.

Hi!

I'm a 20 year old female who is new to the area and looking for a (*very*) strictly platonic chess partner! I haven't started school or work here yet and don't know many people. I also know there is a chess club that meets up in Greenlake...but I am without a car at the moment and getting there would be very difficult. Anyway, I'm looking for a male or female around my age, in West Seattle/Alki area, who would be willing to play chess with me a couple days a week. My schedule is extremely flexible and I'm available all the time :). 

I'm also pretty bad at chess. I learned to play only a couple weeks ago, and I got hooked on it :). So if you think you're terrible at chess, or haven't played in awhile, we'd be a perfect match! If you are really good at chess and would want a confidence booster....I can do that for you too! I'm willing to play anyone.

If this sounds interesting to you, email me and we can talk about specifics :)

Hello. As the title says, I'm looking to find someone to pass the time throughout the day chatting about whatever. No hidden motives. I know, I know, all guys say that, but I'm being honest. I will hopefully find someone who is willing to have intelligent and witty conversations, who will ask questions and don't mind me asking questions, who would be able to continue this longer than a few email exchanges, and basically just a fun person to chat with. I don't care what your relationship status, or age as I'm more concerned with what is in your mind and heart. I'm an amazing listener, I will try and make you laugh when you're feeling down, and an all around nice guy.

Hello!

First off I am 29, very happily married, and would never change or hurt that, but I really enjoy getting to know new people, that are okay keeping it platonic, or risking any harm to anyone's relationship. I am also from Texas, and enjoy getting to know people from other areas as it removes the pressure to meet if there is a connection, and keep relationships safe. 

I work from home most days, which also means I don't do much on those days, and it would be great to have someone new to get to know and share things with. I'm very open minded, goofy, extremely laid back, I don't judge, I'm allergic to drama, I can be really sarcastic but I know when to turn it off, easy to talk to, and I've had an interesting and unique life so far, so I think I have quite a few interesting things/stories to share. I also have a bit of a dirty mind, and might throw a ""that's what she said"" into a conversation at some point. I am also a major night owl, so if you are too, even better!

I am looking for someone who is: intelligent, funny, witty, understands sarcasm, open minded, non-judgemental, dirty minded, drama free (although venting is allowed), easy to talk with, and just fun. 

Again not looking to meet or change anyone's relationship, just looking for fun conversations to get through the day or night. 

Hope you are having a great day and I'm looking forward to chatting with you!

I know a young man who has a good heart that made a bad choice, and is now paying the price for it. He has few friends or family that take time to write, and so far in 2 years has gotten 0 counseling from the people that are supposed to be helping him through this. If you have time to write a few letters and feel like you want to make a difference and be an uplifting help to a misguided kind soul, please contact me for more info.

Hello all!

I am a 24 year old fun loving gal who is looking for a friend or a group of friends to go out with and get close to! I want to find someone who is genuinely interested in keeping up a conversation and wants to get together either today or tomorrow for a drink or coffee. Please be 420 friendly and open minded. 

No
Judgemental people
Flakes
Big egos *unless it's tempered with a great sense of humor
Sedentary lifestyles *I like to hike and see pretty sights. 

I'm really hoping to find someone I can go out with all the time and really spend a lot of time with and grow close to. It's been a long time since I've had a close friend and I don't want to continue to go on feeling the way I do now. I know there's someone out there for me and I hope as you're reading this maybe it's you. I look forward to hearing from you!

Thank you for reading. I'll be in the Seattle area on business Thursday through Saturday. Staying near Seatac. Usually have dinner plans...but I'm free the entire time. Would really enjoy meeting someone for dinner and drinks on me. And that's it! We meet at the restaurant and leave separately.

You: over 40, funny, intelligent, loves conversation and interesting

No need to dress up as it will be fairly casual and totally about enjoying great conversation.

I have attached a photo for both safety and because we should be able to recognize each other before we meet. So please attached a photo if interested.

Hello, I'm looking for strictly a gaming buddy.

Nothing relationship wise or sexual.

I have a fiance, I'm just looking for a girl to game with simply because I get along with women better than men.

I play a lot of games. From FPS's to MMO's, MOBA's and RPG's, racing and strategy.

I play mostly on Steam, and Battle.net, some games on Origin from time to time.

I'm (For the most part, and not to sound too full of myself) a pretty competent gamer. I've played some games at the very highest level. I used to stream and do the youtubes as well. I'm wanting to get back into it later this year and rebuild my twitch and youtube channels again.

I play dota 2 (Around 3.5 - 4k mmr usually), league of legends (Ive always gotten gold for my friends every season, but I never care about my account. But most of my friends for league I play with are plat + diamond), HoTS, D3, I used to play WoW and was raid lead for 2 heroic progression guilds, had world rankings on my resto drood, and always ran for server 1st kills and tried for world kills and what not :)

I play CS GO (I was DMG but haven't played in a few months), and much much more. :) I also play Magic (I enjoy white/green decks, and black). Also have Path of Exile, Killing Floor 2, etc.

Just looking for someone to play with, you don't have to be amazing. But it would be nice if you knew your way around the basics.

I'm also extremely nerdy. I'm great with computers, networking (Having trouble with your DMZ and QOS/COS? Or are you having trouble federating and can't contact anyone out of your business in lync? Easy peasey), hardware or software as well.

Also just some more info about me. I don't drink, do drugs or smoke. I'm pretty friendly, I'm also pretty conservative. 

Blah blah blah, lots of stuff.

I'm a tech professional with high drive in a top tech company in the area. I'll launch my/our new tech business over the next 1 year. I'd like to enter the trillion dollar fin-tech industry, where I'd like to leverage technology to build no-nonsense, convenient, and fast product/service. As a consumer/customer of this industry, I have pain points, and I know there are millions of others who feel the same. So, I'd like to solve problems of millions of consumers like me and as a result ...

For the next 6-18 months, I'll develop this product side by side of my current job. If you are employed right now, you can do the same.

For a successful business, I believe the partners need to complement each other. I'm good with numbers, plus I can build very good technological solution, but I lack background in finance, banking, and accounting. So, my ideal partner will be someone who is experienced in this industry, either with corporate customers, or individual consumers. You will be the face of the business as well, and I'll manage the back-end solution and product. You'll need to shape the product/service as well, because I know HOW, but I need you to tell me WHAT to do and not to do.

This is not a get rich easy scheme or anything. This is the get rich quick with hard work based on a solid product or service, by identifying a customer need and fulfilling it with exceptional quality, customer service, and superb marketing, and branding, and scaling it for millions of people leveraging technology. If you have the finance/accounting background you should be able to easily envision how rich can you get.

I'm also in corporate employee at this moment. Both you and I know that corporate job will award you with 1-2% raise on top of your 50-150K per year salary, for your hard work of 70 hours/week. So, I'd like us to channel the energy to our own venture which can easily earn 50-150K per month.

I'm also NOT looking for any investment (not even a single penny) from your part. Just bring in your charisma, experience, expertise, high drive, passion, hunger, desire, and of course humor :)

I look forward to hearing from you :)

Cheers!

My name's Myfi! 

I'm a bit afraid of meeting new people, but I'm very friendly once I'm given the chance to get comfortable, I love to bake (and I will shunt many food-gifts upon you if you'll let me), I love tea , movies and animals(this includes reptiles. I own two. Be not afraid). 

I am generally relatively low-energy due to being out of shape and various other reasons, but if you have ideas for things to do I'm up for a fair amount of things! I am very blunt and fairly snarky, but I am an excellent listener and if you need someone to talk to about ANYTHING, I will sit and be a shoulder to lean on and will give generally sage advice upon being asked. I do have a long-term dedicated partner and we tend to spend our weekends together, so all of my free time is during the day (8am to 4pm) during the week. I also have the added benefit of having an adorable puppy who is SUPER high-energy and looking for routine playmates!

I do not drive, so relative closeness or a willingness to drive to me is wonderful, though I am equally content to make phone-friends or online friends! 

I'm not christian or religious and as long as you don't try to convert me I have no issues!
I am very libertarian and pro gun, so gun control supporters probably shouldn't apply. I'm incredibly prickly about being able to protect myself and equalize the playing field, as weak as I am physically.
I love all music except for rap. When I say all music, I mean everything from rock to metal to electronic to classical and opera to jazz and swing to disney music. As long as it's not Let It Go we'll get along great. I'm a bit of a budding audiophile as well!

I have a massive appreciation of nature which is a little ironic being that I've not been able to get out in it anywhere near as much as I'd like. 

The only thing I partake of to any degree is alcohol, and I'm insanely picky about it. I don't particularly have issues with anything you may or may not do, with the preference that if it's something illicit you not do it around me! I'm fine with pot smokers as well, but I ask it not be smoked around me(at least in an area where I would get the smell on me) as my partner is very sensitive and it would cause him to have severe nosebleeds :)

I'm told that I am a very giving and wonderful friend by what few I have scattered across the states and other countries! I'm fine with platonic snuggles and the like if and once you are(because who doesn't like to dogpile during movies, right? Especially when there's a cute pup!)

I mostly dream of raising tons of adorable baby animals, from reptiles to birds to mammals to insects! I am also obsessed with aircraft and many of the other Nicer Things With Engines that exist. Physics is good shit.

I'm a big movie goer, but I hate the fact that if the movie is bad, I can't turn to the person beside me and quietly berate it, or to pretend the tear in my eye is from where a piece of popcorn that miraculously hit me in the eye. I'm also very creative. I write. I have a book self-published on Amazon, I write poetry, like to sing etc, and would like to find someone to share my creative spirit with.

Please do not contact me if you have or want a kid, I have tried getting along with people who have or want kids my age before and it just doesn't work. Also please don't contact me if you smoke cigarettes, it is a disgusting habit and you smell nasty. 

I like nature and guinea pigs. My favorite band is Blood on the Dance Floor, no I am not an extreme fan and I will not threaten to kill you or say you are a horrible person if you do not like them. 

I just recently started getting into Crown The Empire, I like Bart Baker and nature music. My music taste can be all over the place but I will not listen to religious Music, Folk Music or music where the singer is screaming to the point that I have to guess what they are saying so most screamo/metal lol

I can be very talkative, but in person I am not extremely talkative. I am autistic, so I do not like people touching me very much. Even a handshake makes me uncomfortable. Unless you are put on to my list of people I am comfortable with having physical contact with, I probably won't want much physical contact. It's part of being autistic.

When I'm not in school, I try to be in the gym or I am out running errands. I like to draw, color, swim, walk and lift weights with my lower body.

I am a minimalist, I have slight obsessive compulsive disorder and I am horrible at washing dishes. I like long naps and procrastinating on the weekend. I also love Supernatural.

I love rodents, some reptiles and horses. Guinea pigs are my favorite animal. I don't really like cats but I can kind of get along with them.

You can add me on Facebook @dahvie hammons (creamsicle). My profile picture is a headshot of a orange, cream and black colored Fox dragon. 

Please do not add me if you do not intend to speak with me. Or if you don't intend to talk very much, I don't want to add people who will just collect dust on my friend list.

Oh, please don't contact me if you are religious, why make fun of God all the time, and I generally feel uncomfortable around religious people. I support abortions and Bernie Sanders. 

It would be really great to find another vegan or at least vegetarian in the area. Not a requirement at all but it would be great to actually find someone I can relate with on a different level.

I did mention I was disabled, I am not wheelchair-bound, I have autism and Whiplash in my back and neck. I can definitely walk for about an hour before I get tired.

Please be under the age of 30.

So I work 6 days a week from 4am to 11pm. Off on Monday's only. Don't have much of a life as you can imagine. I've been doing this for so long that I've forgotten what it was to sit and chat with a lady. Yes what I'm looking for is a LADY, no I'm not interested in sex just harmless chat over coffee, dinner or a glass of wine. Some days I get lucky and can leave work early, and it usually happens when I'm anxious about something and needing someone to talk to. I've noticed that because of my schedule that over the years I've lost all of my friends and can't find anyone to chat with. This makes life very lonely. 

A bit about myself, I'm a workaholic as you probably figured out. I'm well traveled and love the arts. I'm 48 and I'm not much of an athlete but I'm 6' tall and 198 lbs. , I don't think I'm overweight but I'm not a twig either. I think they call it HWP on CL. So if you are interested in some evening chat, maybe a movie, dinner, wine, coffee or the like, drop me a line. BTW anything we do is my treat. It's a cultural thing so don't think because I pick up the check I want anything more than a nice evening with a nice lady. I don't care how old you are just be between 25 and 55.

Let's just say, if I knew what I was really looking for, maybe I wouldn't be looking for it here. 

With that out of the way, for now I'd like to find someone interested in chatting via e-mail, with the potential to move over to Kik. Not looking to trade phone numbers, pictures, or personal e-mails right off the bat. I'm not in Seattle, so the possibility of meeting up is pretty slim.

I'm interested in things that will keep the conversation moving. I like the standard stuff: movies, music, television, travel. I like to read, but don't do it much. If I'm gaming, it's more likely to be retro (Sorry, UNO, Pictionary, Balderdash) than current (Halo, Bioshock, WoW - that's still a thing, right?). Yes, I'm in my 30s and yes, I still love the 80s. (Meaning the decade...not specifically octogenarians.)

I enjoy writing. I enjoy flirting. I enjoy analyzing other people's problems more than my own. If you've got a dirty mind, that makes two of us.

I'd prefer chatting with men 30-50 who have a strong grasp on grammar and the English language (sorry, it's the only language in which I am fluent), who aren't going to push for pics or cam, who have a versatile sense of humor, and who are creative...but not afraid of science and math. (Okay, a little afraid of math is understandable.) I'm willing to be flexible on some of those things more than others.

If you're still reading this and feel like striking up a conversation, go ahead! Just put your name (or whatever you want me to call you) and your age in the subject so I know you're at least a highly functional A.I.

P.S. I'm not actually sleepless. If I don't reply to you immediately, I might be passed out somewhere. Oh, and if you're someone who has a hang-up about talking to chicks who may (or may not, I don't know how much pizza you eat) weigh more than you, don't bother. I am one of those ""BBW"" gals.

Hello CL,

I just moved to the Seattle area last month and looking for a work out partner/friend. I have a gym membership at Planet Fitness. (I know it sucks, but it's the closest to my home and free guest so you don't have to pay for the membership) I've been working out for a few months and lost a couple pounds but with moving and the chaos of finding a job I lost motivation to go work out. I want someone who has goals and knows what they are doing. (you don't have to be a pro or a personal trainer) I would prefer someone who isn't afraid to lift weights and get sweaty. Hopefully someone around 20-27 years old. I don't want to look like someones mother or a sugar baby. 

About me:
23 yr old from California. Lesbian. (I won't hit on you so don't worry.) I am tech savvy and love to play video games. I'm pretty nerdy you can say since I also like anime and cosplay. I enjoy being outside and reading. I'm pretty easy going. (or at least I think so) I can be shy at first but once the ice is broken it's smooth sailing. I have a good sense of humor. I am 420 friendly but I don't smoke. I will go out a drink here and there.
Hopefully we can become friends and hang out after. 

If you think this is you, send me a message. I will send pictures if I feel comfortable enough talking to you before we meet.

I am looking to find a nice gal who perhaps we can develop a special friendship, talktime or weekly walks, and maybe, needs an amazing massage. It would be a bonus for me-if you are trained professionally in massage or have some ongoing experience I would be able to enjoy too. I can bring my portable massage table and sheets and you supply a small, cozy room, oils and lotion, or i can. A little about me; I'm told i look tall & handsome, and broadshouldered, w a cleancut appearance. I also feel and look great and have nice ""feet"" and a nice V shaped upper body, and attributes;(smooth/soft hands) I workout regularly, about 3x a week, and eat pretty well to stay hwp. I am looking for perhaps a platonic female partner of any age for this. We will see about doing this weekly..one coffee, or massage ;) at a time, but no expectations. I am fun, funny, and down right witty sometimes, I've been told. Also, clean cut, nice, gentle, ddf and ""a genuine great guy"". I can do a great Deep Tissue massage or a wonderful light touch Swedish massage. Reciprocation would be nice, but what ever YOU Like. Its up to you! If your personable, nice, nice looking ; ) hwp and ddf, fun and exciting(like me ; ) perhaps, open to a new friend, and willing to let go a bit, let me know! Please send a picture or 3 ;) ideally, and a bit about you. Put ur favorite drink in subject line! NO SPAM - THANKS for reading and responding!

Let's get together and have our own 'photoshoot'. We'll just go out and have fun for a few hours or a day.

We could travel around, rivers, ocean, near a boat or in a City art galleries, coffee shops... whatever we're interested in. We could even bring a few pieces of clothing to change it up a bit.

Thanks!

You are a woman, in Washington, looking for friends, but scared or embarrassed to post on Craigslist even though it sort of seems like the final option. 
You thought about answering an ad on Craigslist, but it seemed so awkward or you started to doubt that it really meant platonic...
You are a reasonably stable person. You are probably 24-49, definitely an adult. You know where you are sleeping tonight and who with even if that's your cat/dog/chimp.
Maybe you are in college, maybe you are an artist, maybe you are a SAHM or you might have a job
9-5/M-F...
Whatever the rest of your life looks like, there's some vacancies in the friends department. Probably especially the Best Friends department. Whether you relocated or outgrew your High School friends or had to break unhealthy connections...
NOW you are in the mood for that one friend who smiles when she sees you coming or the little group that will throw you a birthday party and you won't mind because they know how to do it for you.
So,

Hello.

I'm James. My friends call me James. . . feel free to call me James if you'd like.

I want to find a friend or two to hang out with!

I'm Single, artist, well-educated, well-traveled, adventurous, Liberal, non-racist, no drugs, no smoking.

⚫ Chatting at a local coffee shop?
⚫ Watching a movie?
⚫ Just hanging out having random conversations?
⚫ Going for a walk (mile or two?)
⚫ Going for a hike?
⚫ Exploring a local City?
⚫ Head off to the Ocean?
⚫ A motorcycle ride (I have a spare helmet)

Platonic. I just find I get along better with women them most men. Maybe I'll place an ad for gay men too... they don't seem to have the Testosterone poisoning that straight men do.

PLEASE DON'T RESPOND UNLESS YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT FINDING A NEW PLATONIC FRIEND. 


That being said, I am a 34 y/o lesbian, a working mom, with 2 kids, a wife and 3 adorable dogs at home. I'm pretty laid back, open, honest and love to laugh. I love the Seahawks, movies, good friends and good times, travel, karaoke, shopping...etc

You should be around my age unless you're an extremely mature younger person, and actually have time to hang out. (Which means you don't live 20+ miles away unless you're one of those people who doesn't mind the drive. I am NOT that person lol) The problem I have with current friends is that I almost never see them and my very best friends don't live close anymore. 
If I say something to you that may sound insignificant to any Joe Schmoe, but is a big deal to me, I want someone who will totally get the significance and respond appropriately.
That's not asking for much, right?
I want to share my thoughts, my retarded jokes, my hopes, my fears and all that other bestie stuff without judgement. Let's bitch about the parts of life that suck over a glass of wine...or shots of tequila, whatever seems appropriate at the time.
I want to be family we got to choose for ourselves.

Fair Warning:
I don't let people in right off the bat, I have PTSD and a little bit of social anxiety, I'm kinda shy and I prefer to email or text until I get comfortable and think a friendship would work before meeting in person. But if you can be patient and bear with me, it could be totally worth the wait.

Bonus points- 
You have minimal drama
You're LGBT (I could REALLY use more gay friends!)
Seahawks fan
420 doesn't bother you 
You're a parent
You're awesome :)
None of these are deal breakers, except the awesome part ;)

If you think we might be a good fit feel free to hit me up!
Your pic gets mine, but it's really not that big of a deal.

Hello CL,

I just moved to the Seattle area last month and looking for a work out partner/friend. I have a gym membership at Planet Fitness. (I know it sucks, but it's the closest to my home and free guest so you don't have to pay for the membership) I've been working out for a few months and lost a couple pounds but with moving and the chaos of finding a job I lost motivation to go work out. I want someone who has goals and knows what they are doing. (you don't have to be a pro or a personal trainer) I would prefer someone who isn't afraid to lift weights and get sweaty. Hopefully someone around 20-27 years old. I don't want to look like someones mother or a sugar baby. 

About me:
23 yr old from California. Lesbian. (I won't hit on you so don't worry.) I am tech savvy and love to play video games. I'm pretty nerdy you can say since I also like anime and cosplay. I enjoy being outside and reading. I'm pretty easy going. (or at least I think so) I can be shy at first but once the ice is broken it's smooth sailing. I have a good sense of humor. I am 420 friendly but I don't smoke. I will go out a drink here and there.
Hopefully we can become friends and hang out after. 

If you think this is you, send me a message. I will send pictures if I feel comfortable enough talking to you before we meet.

Greetings Fellow Craiglister...

Like most of us this time of year, I am focused on shedding a few pounds and making a few new friends. I would like to lose 30lbs and it is always easier with a buddy. More importantly though, I would love to meet new friend or 2 for brunches, craft time, hanging out at the beach, happy hour, wine tasting, sharing, caring, camaraderie. 

A little bit about me: I am 31, lives with my boyfriend in Ballard, no kids, flexible working schedule, Gym membership at Olympic Athletic Club, walk a monthly 5K, love to cook, Seahawks Fan. 

A little bit about you: Friendship goes both ways, please don't be flakey or unavailable. I am looking for someone who would like to get together weekly, has similar interests and enjoys the give and take of a genuine friend. 

Thank you for checking out my ad, I look forward to hear from you :)

My job doesn't make me enough money to pay for all the needed things, plus everything for school and I'm working on getting another one. But in the meantime, I have to pay these fees or I won't be able to continue in the classes.

If you or someone you know, would be willing to help out a little bit? If they have work I could do to earn it, or I can pay it back and I have ways I can ensure that. It's really important/needed and I would so greatly approximate the help. 

Ps, I'm not some drug seeker asking for drug money like some other people on here.

Realization has came; I need higher quality friends. 

It's easy for me to go out to a venue at night, and meet some cool new people, but lately, I haven't found the time for it, meaning I'm more focused on making money than meeting potentially cool new people. 

Also, I don't like the chaos of some night venues (aka Capitol Hill), and running into some of the frequent, up tight, scarcity ridden, basic bitch/basic dude, jack holes. I made that up. Jack holes, sounds like Asshole, but I subconsciously combined Jackass and Asshole, since there's plenty of that to go around. 

Close to a decade back (7 years ago or so), I used Strictly Platonic and only one straight guy replied to me, and he kept rambling about Julius Caesar and how being a public servant was a privilege and if enemies are at the gate, it's great to serve and protect people. Then my memory hit, he's using lines from the motherfucking Batman Dark Knight Joker movie, preaching it like its his own belief, when dude hasn't even seen war. Dude must've really loved Harvey Dent. 

-_-

I'm not opposed to being friends with gay dudes, but to be honest, I don't feel like I have much in common with them, but more so with straight dudes. And to be fair, I probably have more in common with straight/lesbian women than I do with gay dudes, despite opposite gender positioning. 

Let's cut to the chase, I've been weighing on reasons why tonight I need to have less contact with another friend and the pros of not talking to him outweigh the cons, so I made the decision to only hit the dude up maybe once every 3-4 weeks. Yes, it's that bad.

Then it made me realize what sort of people I want in my life and me knowing what I have to offer.
So here's the damn list:

Future Friend Reference Qualifications:

Has to be socially attuned, this means they know how one dresses shows social intelligence, which means not dressing like a retard/full blown D&D nerd. 



Has to not be BASIC aka Basic Bitch, or AKA Basic Bro, good redeeming qualities that differentiate him/her from the rest of the pack. I don't care to hear about your sorority/frat pack shit or mindless chatter. I want something deeper and meaningful, existential and long term goals for both of us that makes us more than what we currently are. 



Exemplify The Quality of Their Gender/Sex. --- If you're a woman that means being feminine and can cook a mean breakfast, or can turn the on switch when necessary to be feminine such as speaking smoothly and eloquently. And if a man, then being masculine, knowing when it's time to be a man's man, like fixing your flat tire, shooting guns/bows with arrows/hunting or switching out the damn car battery. 



Has To Know/Be Aware of Red Pill Truth/Reality/Social Constructs (especially race/class/etc.) & Benefit of the Nuclear Family Structure. - You know third wave feminism is a construct designed for first world privileged people to be even more privileged. As a person of color, it's the next progression of privilege to another party when a certain party already has privilege because of them being the dominant race in America. 

Also it helps if you know the current cultural landscape/history of colored folks and their struggles, from Black to Latino to Asian to Native. You watch shows Black-Ish/Fresh Off The Boat and you UNDERSTAND the Humor and APPRECIATE IT. I don't want to befriend someone who doesn't know these things and has no compassion/understanding toward what's really happening to people in reality like un-armed Black males being killed. To me, you're a BASIC BITCH/BRO if you don't know this shit or can't even empathize with this situation. 


Has To Have Connections or Be Able to Build Connections/Have Good Interactions with others. - This one's self explanatory. The saying goes, you move quicker alone, but you go farther with others at your side. I'm quite capable of this. Making good connections requires basic rapport and also screening, which is obviously what I'm doing in this post. This means spotting business opportunities and advantageous social connections. 




Has To Know How To Make Good Money or Have Good Money So They Don't Skimp Out On You & Hoard All For Themselves. Good Friends Tend To Be Generous and Encourage You To Become A Generous, Kind Human Being As Well In Return. Paying It Forward. 


-Basically, you're the average of your 5 closest friends. You've ever been friends with a broke ass person who has poor money management skills and doesn't respect the power of a dollar? They're pretty dumb right (and make poor life choices)? I don't want my close friends to be broke, otherwise we can't learn how to make money from each other and prosper together. Also if you're friends are money makers, it encourages you to step your game up too all the time. And if something happens to one another, we always have each others' backs, not just take, take, take, but give when someone has an accidental slip up. 

We're generous when giving to each other in the time of need and using those resources wisely and effectively, and not recklessly and stupidly. Example; you're going through a bullshit lawsuit and I have money to help you out while your finances are tied up, I'd help you out in a heart beat and you repay me a year or 2 later back if/whenever I'm ever in a tough spot. 

Can't Be Pushy/Selfish Or Push Their Agenda If They Haven't Made It Themselves or You Feel Is Harming You/Your Energy.

---You can't give me advice and have me accept it if I didn't want it in the first place or if it's only helping you or is from your own agenda or bias and for your own ego. It has to come from a place of true understanding, such as what would you do yourself if you were in their exact shoes. Like if you liked your smoothies to taste a certain way, I wouldn't tell you to alter it if it only fits to my taste in my smoothies, and you yourself find it disgusting. 

Has To Care About Similar Things As You Or Can/Is Willing Care About Similar Things As You. 

This one is pretty damn self-explanatory. Also, I'm a person of aesthetics, and care about my health. Even if I'm not the guy fucking you, I very much prefer not to be in the presence of someone who is obese, male or female. I find it repulsive when I'm near someone fat/out of shape and I hear them struggling to breathe for air and when they sit down on a bench next to me, it's like a fucking mini-earthquake that just occurred. 


So if you're not a Basic Bitch, and you don't get your panties in a bunch from street lingo, or if you grew up in the projects and you know what's truly real and genuine (or you're just a genuine person in general), then feel free to hit me up, especially if a lot of points I mentioned in this post vibe with you.

There's a lot of snake, two faced Libras out there, and I ain't one of them. I'll tell you to your face what it is, and I expect the same. And if someone cuts us off while we're rolling in traffic, I'll yell in their face after I pull up next to them, and hand them their ass if they're asking for it, courtesy mutual combat law of Washington State. 

I'll also delete your post if I think it's spam. Better write our sign in the subject line or NOT SPAM, or it'll be deleted. 

Also random notes about me:

I cook a mean mango curry chicken.

I make crazy smoothies.

I'm involved in design/e-commerce.

I can sing pretty well.

I can hold an E note.

I love Keanu Reeves, even though his acting isn't the best. I feel an affinity with the dude, not in a gay way either.

I can crack you up at awkward times.

I have a wide taste in music, and I can name all the artists I do listen to.

Likes: Black women!. Classic Soul Music. R&B. Blues Music. Talking & texting on the phone all hours of the day. Going to the movies. Holding hands. Rocking the house at karaoke.

Some of my favorite shows I have binged watched are as follows: Game Of Thrones,True Blood, X Files, and Boardwalk Empire. Desire a woman who would hold me tighter and be loving on my bad days as we would whether the storm together as a couple.

Dislikes: Drugs. Heavy drinkers. Endless Emails and Texts. Life if too short to be wasted on such things.

(alright, lemme try this again. . .)

So, just thought I'd try this out. . ...
I moved here a little more than a year ago, got a job, and walked/drove around a bit, but still haven't made any friends in all that time. The solitude, though convenient for the most part, does take it's toll. Truth be told, I'm not much of a social person, hard to get to know at first, and chances are I'll probably flake out of meeting people who respond to this. But when I do end up making friends, I'm pretty loyal. 

About me: 35; straight; work full-time in construction; love binge-watching tv and movie marathons; love watching stand-up comedy. I HATE working out, BUT I do it anyway occasionally just to keep from getting injured (I'm at that age where everything is starting to 'crack'); read books/comics; not much of a gamer (last system i had was sega genesis); occasional drinker; 420-friendly. . .though I don't personally partake much cuz it's not allowed in my apartment and all it does is make me hungry, plus i save money for other stuff; NOT tech-saavy at all, and i guess my big thing WAS music. . ..haven't played for years, but before that, I was into a lot of metal and punk music, but I lost touch with it. Now i listen to a lot of podcasts. 

Stuff I'd like to do/get back into (but always find excuses not to): hike, rock climb, and other outdoor adventures; drive around more (still trying to figure seattle out, let alone washington); was an avid archer before i moved here; starting to dabble in martial arts; hoping to get back into drawing and art a little more; i'd like to play drums and guitar again, not professionally, but just to jam (i used to play mostly for hard rock and metal bands, but i like all kinds of music), if you have a set of drums and want free drum lessons i'm your guy. would like to learn violin and/or banjo among others, would like to learn another language, and eventually travel more. . .

i dunno. All this is theoretical. Honestly, I'm really a 'whatever' kind of guy. I'm not super pro or anti anything. I'm not 'PC'. In actuality, I'm pretty lazy/easy-going, and as much as i like to THINK about discovering new things and blah, blah, blah. . .I really just like to hang out. Just don't preach to me or be creepy or be a dick, i guess. Again, i'm not very social, and can be hard to get to know at first, so don't take it personally if I don't respond to you. I tend to be weary of people, especially on the internet (as I imagine any sane person should). Btw, I can't stress enough that I am absolutely NOT looking for a hook up/romantic relationship. Just a friend. Hell, if all you wanna do is chat or text on the phone, that's cool too. Thanks.

so here I am, posting to this site, haha.. not sure what I'm looking for, maybe a new friend? maybe more? I was with someone I thought was going to be my forever, and after 5 years, I guess she had different feelings towards that.. I never had any doubt, so my whole future was based around her.. I still blame myself for all the what ifs,.. it's hard. I haven't attempted dating or anything for over a year now.. To be honest, I'm lonely. I miss just feeling close to someone, I miss the sense of touch the most... 

I want a friend first and foremost, someone to catch a movie with, watch stupid TV with, go on weekend road trips with, get out and explore new things with each other wine and beer tastings, maybe smoke a bowl and watch a new pixar movie or slasher flick lol... what ever happens I don't want to be in a rush.. 

little bit about me, white male 36, could loose a few lbs before summer, so I guess I need to get on that. .6 foot 4, I currently have a full beard, I usually don't, but willing to shave it off for the right lady if she asks me nicely. haha... I am self employed for over 15 years now, I'm a super casual laid back easy going. . no children, just a bunch of nieces and nephews.. I come from a big Mormon family, my parents are still married after almost 50 years. . I look at what they have and know I want the same. . I just hope it's not to late for me.. 

love my blue apron meals and cooking, classic cars and trucks, anything that makes me laugh, love stand up.. History and exploring, Mt rainier to the beach.. 

anyways, if you feel like we might click, write me, send me a picture and maybe I'll send you one back, no picture till I get one. . it seems like this is haw it works, oh, and I really don't know what all these abbreviations are, so be blunt with me.. lol

good luck

Hello, I've been thinking how nice it would be to have a on call cleaning helper,
someone that's average looking, but not big'', and that's nice to be with.
I'm a company owner that works alone at night,
and I would just post in the gig's area on here if I wanted just anyone,
but I don't want just anyone, I want the person to be a friend too.
As weird as that may sound, I want us to be able to chat and get along too, not just work.
I don't know if that would be looked at as weird, or not.
I only want some light cleaning help from time to time, so maybe a Saturday sometime is all I want,
and finding a friend to come in and hang out and help me with cleaning sounds like a better idea.
I have tried posting for a friend on here, someone from around here this area,
and I can't even seem to find that, and I don't want to bug everyone I meet to give my a hand,
so I'm looking for some advice from a woman, or maybe this sounds like something you may like?
if not maybe you can give me a idea on where to look, or how to look for her.
Thank you all for your point view''.

Well, I've been trying to get my money back out of an extra ticket I've got to no avail so I've decided to go the charitable-ish route instead. I've opted to trade it for company lol. 

Me and my cousin will be heading down a little early on Saturday, just looking for someone fun and energetic who wants to ride along and do a little pregaming at the bar beforehand. Not looking for any favors or pervy shit like that, just a high energy person to get amped up with before the show. Once we get inside you are free to keep hanging out or ditch us and find some other people to run with.

We will be staying at the Marriott up the street so you can either line up a ride home that night or crash back at the hotel. It's a queen suite so if you decide to stay there's a foldout bed in the living room, no having to cuddle up to a stranger unless you wanna lol.

Now, there's only three stipulations to this offer. 
1) be between 21-26 years old. 
2) be a sociable, energetic person. 
3) be 420 friendly. Actually, you don't even have to smoke. Just don't take issue with it if I do.

Also, we intend to roll at the show so if you plan on hanging out just know that will be happening.

Well, think that's about all I've got to say on the matter. Shoot me an email with a picture, a little about yourself, and any other questions you might have. If you sound like a good match I will respond in kind. Oh yeah and change the subject to the artist you're most excited to see.

I moved to Tacoma from Seattle in December, and now that my home base is largely stable, I'm redirecting some energy into trying to build a queer friend network down south. Say hi if you're in Pierce county, especially north Tacoma!

Some stuff about me:
I'm 27, cis [she/her or singular 'they' pronouns], queer [largely attracted to hard femmes, androgyny & masculinity], femme-identified, polyamorous [currently 1 live-in partner + 1 comet partner, open to dating], child-free [& don't want any], multi-medium artist, self-employed small business owner, empath & HSP, energy worker [reiki], proud SJW, cat lady, out since age 14. Some hobbies include travel, photography, writing, coffee, meditation, thrifting, writing sarcastic things on the internet, smoking a bowl and having soul-enriching conversations. I'm not really into small talk; I'd much rather honor authenticity and get to know you as a person, not play games.
I work from home, so while getting out and seeing the city is important to me, I'd also love to eventually find people I could hang out with often and invite over during the day for coffee dates, study hall [meaning: we both work but occasionally chat], hangouts, & whatever. Since we might meet from CL first, though, we'll stick to a coffee shop.
Thanks for reading!

Hey Baby,

I really missed you this weekend. I thought about you a lot for whatever reason.

I hope this finds you well and happy. Do you feel good? I hope you were not too lonely without me. What were you doing this weekend? You didn't have to work, I hope. Did you manage to get something accomplished or was it just a lazy weekend? Any good movie,good eats, did you get all rain soaked too?

Saturday,I went down to the Edmonds Goodwill, found a beautiful Patagonia jacket. It was a nice day. Stopped at PCC too, got a few goodies. Went and had my hair colored/cut. After that, went out with my brother. We did have a good time, smoked some ganja, shot a few games of pool, then down for some some Creole food. But it wasn't the same with out you there. Downright depressing having a family relation for a date, no matter how well you get along.

Sunday, did some chores, went to Costco. Made a special trip to Home Depot, where I did not find what I was looking for, which was quite irritating. And it was so stormy out. I was getting soaked just trying to run a few errands. I thought screw it, and decided to just go back home. Good decision, a warm and cozy afternoon, watching the storm from inside, after the more tactile experience from earlier. I put my fuzzy pants on, made some cookies. Watched a depressing WWI movie with Russel Crowe, then John Oliver, and such. I love watching JO make fun of ""Drumpf."" It's a few minutes I can laugh about the whole thing, instead of feel that general sense of horror. He also did an informative rant about Special (local taxing) Districts. It was pretty interesting, they are like the ""black budget"" projects for the Feds, accountable to no one, only on a local taxation level. A little disturbing.

I made Petrale Sole and Artichokes for dinner. You would have loved that, I would have had so much more fun with you there to laugh and cuddle with. I am almost finished with my Bill Bryson book.

Any who, I am back to work on Monday morning, another drizzly day. Beats last year's drought conditions I guess. Like you, I have always loved the rain. I really like my new office space, and it's great having someone divert so many calls now. We will have more time to spend together. I am live streaming KEXP right now, they frown on that here, but I found a work around :). Gonna go to my Monday night work out after work tonight, then I will be back safe home again.I took a silly selfy of me right before work out the other day. I was feeling particularly vital and youthful at the time (gotta capture the moment don't always feel like that these days - ha ha). Maybe I could send it to you.

Sometimes, I just can't wait to look in your kind eyes, and see your beautiful smile.I can imagine you holding me tight, and the relief I will feel knowing you are there. I am OK by myself, but can be hard without you sometimes.These guys I have met, they are not you, so I don't even bother. Why even? - with the too young and ""friends with benefits"" bull shit - if it's not for reals. And because I know you have stayed faithful to me too for the same reasons. You are out there, I feel you, and it's going to be worth the time it took my love.

As Always!

The other day I was checking stuff out on Facebook. When a picture caught my eye. It was one of those ""people you may know"" pictures. It took me a second before I realized I did know the woman in the picture. My high school sweetheart. Class of 19 hundred and 78. Lisa was her name, and for a nano second she once again made my heart smile. I think her dad was my age when I started dating her. He was a big man with an evil eye on me. Lol. Rightfully so. I was a senior she was a freshman. I still Remember the first time I met her. I was throwing a football around in my front yard with a friend. She was on her bike, and stopped to watch me. She was 14, I was 17. I didn't like her. Thought she was a pest and she wouldn't leave me alone. One day she even came to my house asking for me. My mom thought it was cute and says ""oh he's in his room go on in"" (that was a mistake lol). After awhile she seemed pretty cool. Sort of a tomboy type. We talked, started hanging out together, fishing together, making out in my 64 Chevy in my front yard, (what the hell was I thinking, oh ya I wasn't) of course we got caught. Mom didn't think she was so cute then. Lol. She was my only girlfriend in highschool, my first love, my first best friend. Unfortunately (kind of) before I met her I had already signed the line to join the Navy. She couldn't handle the long distance and I don't blame her for moving on. I mean come on we were just kids. There is a lot more to this story but I will spare you the details. One thing I know is I loved that girl. Everyone said it was just a crush, or I think I loved her. Well that was over 35 years ago. And her picture still moves me today. I was right. I did really love her. Have you ever wondered if things went differently how your life would have maybe changed. 

Here's to you Lisa. There has been and always will be a spot in my heart for you. Love always Jim.

Good morning, I hope you had a nice weekend, and if you see this post later in the week, I hope your week is going well.

I am looking for a bit of an odd strictly platonic relationship. I am looking for a woman who goes to the Y in Sumner and wants to have a secret buddy. We will only chat in email, we will share no face pictures. What we can do is know we each have a secret buddy at the gym, whom might be there when we are and who might not. A secret admirer in a way. We can push each other to our fitness goals. We can also have fun in some ways with each other, through flirting or whatever, but we will never meet. Well we can chat about it and see if it works for us. If you are interested in chatting about it the ideas are endless and I am wide open. Shoot me a note and lets chat.

And see where it might go from there.

Happy rainy season to my fellow Seattleites, I'm hoping I am able to find someone looking for something similar to me. I'm looking for my secret friend, that friend I get to keep to myself, email, txt, kik with. To keep me grounded, give me honest feedback, and to be my sounding board. I lost that when I moved here four years ago, and with my hectic life, haven't been able to find it since. Someone I can grab coffee or lunch with, share a laugh and keep a sense of clarity that I need.

Me - late 30's, white, married, sarcastic, a bit geeky, well read, educated and have a stable job.

You - near my age, enjoy sarcasm, looking for a friend to chat with, and able to carry a conversation.

Where it goes? Don't know, but open to possibilities. Hope to hear from you soon.

Your looks, ethnic background, age, etc. are not important to me as long as you are comfortable with my age and you are emotionally stable - no drama.

Hello all! I'm currently looking for a new female friend to help spark my own interest. Someone I can talk to without fear of any sexual tension between us what so ever. 

I am engaged to a beautiful woman and love her dearly however our situation is complicated for me to explain. I love her but we have been so attached to one another I need to have a friend or friends of the opposite sex to converse with. And I prefer to find someone intellectual I can talk to when I am free or text and actually have a friend. But I will warn all who respond, my fiance is an extremely jealous person however I have nothing to hide, I really am looking for a friend.

There are terms and conditions to what I am looking for.

Little bit about me:

Working professional, Marine Diesel Mechanic 12 hours most days when work is heavy.
I love pot, I love to talk about it, I would hope you have some sort of green thumb.
I look pretty damn good considering what I did to transform my body. There's no polite way or good way to make this sound ok but.....please be level headed and care about your whole body, not just physical appearance.

I like to talk vision and life goals, the older I get,the wiser I have become. I am starting to see a much bigger picture of life.

I prefer text

Write me a short little email describing yourself and what you do and maybe we can be friends.


I love poetry FYI.

Hello.

I'm seeking connection. I'm a lonely fairy creature.

I'm an intelligent, eccentric, eclectic, adorable, ridiculous, charming young lady. I'm exceptionally sweet and still delight in all the marvels in this world. I'm one of the most accepting and open-minded people you'll ever have the chance to meet. I appreciate the little things, I allow them to delight me. I'm quirky and weird and creative. Definitely an artist. 

I treat everyone with kindness and enjoy being treated with kindness in return.

I love animals and children. I'm the sort of person who was born to be a mother, very nurturing and maternal. Part of being an excellent mother (to me) means waiting for the right time.

I'm new to this area. Seeking friendship, mentorship, nurturing, mutually beneficial relationships. 

I am a recent college graduate, working almost full-time making no more money than I did prior to attending college. I enjoy my job, though I am seeking better opportunities. I'm in a transitional period in life, in a temporary room mate situation, out of a long term relationship, ready to make friends, but no longer willing to commit to anyone who isn't marriage and co-parenting material. Some days I dream about having a prince come and whisk me away. I'd love to devote myself to a family. And I am a princess, in the sweetest way. 

Some Daddy issues. Enjoy gentle, firm, dominant older men.

Simultaneously fiercely independent. In an aching, lonely sort of way.

Kinky as shit.

Intriguing? 

Seeking nourishment. Hungry soul.

420 friendly, lover of arts an crafts, music, theater, movies, magic, whimsy, adventure

Are you a writer, an artist, a composer, an actor or a business guy? Have you been looking for a private, peaceful, quiet place to live and work?

Consider sharing a mostly-furnished ""mature mansion"" perched on the water's edge, on Bainbridge Island. Look across the Sound at Seattle, watch the ferries go by, yell at the gulls and herons, and walk on the beach (low tide). You would have your own upstairs (large) bedroom with adjoining bathroom. You would have access to a downstairs great room (with tv, wifi and music), a fully equipped chef's kitchen and an old-fashioned sun room, with perfect light for painting, drawing or working. A piano could even be arranged. Large outside deck is one of the greatest places to enjoy a Bainbridge summer. Street parking. Ten minutes from downtown Winslow and the ferry terminal. Kitsap Transit commuter bus passes right by the house.

I am a local single guy and have lived alone on the property for four years, established connections on the Island for twenty. I am making some serious career/life changes which are limiting me from covering the monthly rent and expenses without some help. I would be looking for $1100 per month to cover your portion of the rent and shared utilities (water/garbage, electricity, fuel oil, tv/wifi, no house landline phone). You'd only need to buy your food and drink.

I am seeking a single, established, financially secure/responsible professional, whose life circumstances would make such a situation attractive. No cigarettes. No pets. I'd prefer at least a three month commitment, and could agree to month-to-month beyond that.

Please respond and tell me why this situation might be good for you. We can arrange to talk on the phone or meet face-to-face to discuss this opportunity in more detail. Personal and financial references will be required.

It's Saturday night after errands and the like and now my brain is just ready for conversation. I hope to talk with you - if you're awesome, humorous, enjoy back and forth repartee, know witty jokes or converse about most anything else.

What do you do with your free time? What interests you or has you curious?

I'm looking forward to you bringing it!

Oh, hello there. I'm Canadian and live about 14 hours away from you, let's get that out of the way right off the bat. [Insert an ""everyone moving to Canada if Trump is elected"" joke] I totally lied and put a random Seattle zip code - but I'm only looking for a pen pal of sorts, not trying to cheat the system.

I might be a little old fashioned but I still enjoy crafting emails and receiving them. It's almost like this practice has been relegated to the same sphere as smoke signals, carrier pigeons and telegrams [outside of necessary work email communication]. Anyone I personally correspond with on a regular basis reaches me through more instant messaging means. There is definitely something to be said about that immediate feedback but there's also a satisfaction that comes with giving and receiving a well thought out message, however short, in email form. I'm not asking for novels here, I'm asking for random musings from absolute strangers, knowing that a person has decided to dedicate a small portion of their time to share their thoughts with me. Need an outlet for something? Plug into me. I just realized how sexual that sounded but I'm going to leave it there for comedic value.

Howdy, hopefully you have had a fine day as I have, to this point. For whatever reason you are reading this, maybe something here will pique your interest :) I'm Aaron and currently on vacation to Seattle from South Dakota. 26 years old, I am Native American, about 6'2 with short hair and gauges. I play guitar and seek a spiritual path in life, what does spiriruality mean to you? Right now I am doing my best to use the force and go with the flow. It's my first time out of the Midwest though and I have no friends in Seattle. I have had a great time wandering and exploring within the downtown area on my own, plus the hostel I am staying in has great people but something is missing. Maybe just the feeling of a long cruise around the area, seeing the views and enjoying the sound together. I would love a long conversation filled with passionate dialect and intellectual stimulation. Let me make you laugh and feel comfortable with yourself while we spend time getting to know one another. I am a true empath and so there is never an awkward moment with me, awkward silence is not my middle name. I enjoy science fiction and philosophy but also good cannabis with beer on occasion. Studying is a passion of mine, so maybe I am a nerd but it can't be a bad thing that I am more keen on who was chosen to take the acting mantle of Peter Parker than whichever candidate wins the presidential election. If anything I said sounds appealing then please, I implore you to send me a reaponse! This is my first vacation and I would love a friend to help me make it perfect. Who knows, maybe even romantic? Anyway, I cannot wait to hear back from whoever you are.

Love Always,
Aaron

I need a friend. I've been going through a rough patch in life lately and not having anyone to lean on or share my experiences with has affected me. Sometimes I wan't for someone to lean on me. I feel lonely and unmotivated. I need interaction. 

If this sounds like you then perhaps we could befriend each other? I won't judge you and you won't judge me. Wherever you come from in life is okay with me. 

I am looking for someone to talk to, spend time with, someone with whom to find distraction from the status-quo. 

Reply via craigslist email. Tell me why you need a friend. Tell me about what holds you back (your demons) and I tell you what holds me back (my demons). Your pic gets mine. I also don't want to be in charge of this so tell me what you want/expect from me. 



P.S. I've never done this before and have no idea what to expect :/

Hi 
I moved to Washington at the end of 2014. Would like to meet someone who likes to hike around these beautiful mountains. I have taken some classes with the Tacoma Mountaineers and so know how to be safe out there and not get lost. I hike in My Rainier Nat Park a couple of times a week but am open to other places. I would like a hiking partner who can and enjoys hiking 5 to 10 miles and if part of a hike---1000 to 2000 ft elevation gain.
Please share a picture of yourself with your first email and I'll share mine with you.

Welcome to fellow Jeep Wranger owners...

I am posting searching for a friend/s to travel along forest roads, backroads, cross country travel, attend Jeep events, as well as Jeep Jamborees. I'm already registered solo for two jamborees this year.

You don't have to be interested in doing all to respond

More interested in using my vehicle to access and enjoy scenic vistas, that only a capable vehicle would allow. Not looking to test the limits of my vehicle, but not against a challenging trip. 

Someone who also enjoys camping, hiking, photography and or film making would especially spark my interest. I am a photographer and filmmaker as well. So documenting our journeys could possibly be collaborative.

Look forward to your responses, and to the rest... ""It's a Jeep thing, you wouldn't understand""

Hi there...

Looking for someone fun to get to know, hang out with and work together towards exercise and getting in shape.

A little about me: Single, smart, good friend / good listener, fun, sarcastic, soft hearted, athletic, work full-time in Redmond, but live in Seattle. I've had real success in getting in shape and living a healthy lifestyle when I have friends to do it with.

I work out at LA Fitness in Ballard and really want a workout buddy, where we can meet at the gym, do classes together, or ride bikes, walk, hike, etc. And also talk about our challenges, support each other and be accountable. I have 60 lbs to lose, I would prefer someone that has somewhere around there, but certainly not required.

You: Fun, open, smart, DEPENDABLE, guy or girl, gay or straight, religion and race, I'm totally open. Just wanting to meet platonic friends that want to lose weight, have fun and accomplish our goals together.

If this sounds like you, hit me up. Lets meet for a drink or coffee.

Oh and tell me a little about yourself and what you're looking for.

Age totally open but early thirties to late forties might be the best fit.

This one is to discuss the craigslist experience itself!

Bad coz I check my inbox too often, read useless posts and respond to people who are never to write to me!


Good coz its thrilling - the excitement of waiting for a good response to your post or even better the excitement of getting the next message from someone you hit it off with. That adrenalin rush is so damn cool! 

Its like a whole world in itself.

Any of you want to just chat about that? If yes send me an email with ""Craigslist"" in the subject.

Good afternoon ladies

I am a mid 50's gent that stands 5' 6"" and weighs in roughly at 145lbs with dirty blonde/grey hair and a neatly trimmed beard. I have a variety of both indoor and outdoor interests and also enjoy most movies/music.

I am seeking a lady over the age of 45, will consider someone as young as 40 though, that would like to get to know each other and build a friendship. I am not picky about a persons looks as beauty is only skin deep, one's mind and thoughts are more important than one's beauty or size. I also have no problems if your married and just looking for a friend to chat with, but must be open to talking about the dark side of things, meaning the things you enjoy but are afraid to explore or talk about to others behind closed doors.

If anything I've said sounds of interest then please drop me a few lines telling me about yourself. Please use the subject line: Lets Be Friends. That way I'll have some kind of an idea that you are a real live living/breathing human being, pictures would also be nice and help in telling me that you are real.

If we hit it off then maybe down the road we can meet face to face over coffee or something.

Look at my flaws: I judge people by their writing. I'm easily bored. I'm vain. I have a thousand half-finished projects. I fear that, after I die, I will have left nothing of consequence in the world. It seems I also have an imperfect commitment to monogamy, at least in my imagination if not in practice. I also don't believe in sin.

And yet: I am smart, and sometimes funny. I am frequently a good listener, and almost always a good friend. I love a wide range of improbable things, books about Japanese dystopias and giant lawn flamingos and costume jewelry and videogames and big dogs and poetry disguised as song lyrics, and a thousand thousand other things. I am imperfect, wondrous and flawed.

Both side of me are evenly odd.

My name is Aleshanee. (Al-eh-shaw-knee)

I'm into yoga; I go to the Yoga Loft and I am studying to get my certification in yoga instruction. 

I love music. I love listening to and discovering new music. New genres, new bands, whatever. I just love taking it all in. I especially love music made by my friends. I love to see the people I love expressing themselves through their art. To me there's no better way to get to know a person. I love local shows, and the harder and faster the better. There's little I find more enjoyable than being surrounded by sweaty aggressive kids rocking out to awesome music. The whole experience is just kind of what life is about to me.

I am a terrible artist. Like, stick figure bad. But I like to paint, and I love to see other people's art. My favorite artist is Salvador Dali, because I love his dual meanings, and how much weirder he got as he got older. I love museums, street art, tattoos, everything. I love it all. 

I love to read, in fact I spend more time reading than pretty much anything else because I'm usually really fucking bored. I love being transported into different worlds and realities, and coming away with a new perspective on life.

I LOVE to dance. I am strength-training myself to get back into ballet to re-learn some technique so that I can return to my true love, contemporary. 

I am also training to be an aerialist! I have my own ropes and everything. 

I have a career in the cannabis industry, I've been steadily working over the last year and have a ridiculous amount of information on the history, culture, medicinal applications, and legislature of cannabis. 

I am awkward, like, hopelessly awkward, but in an endearing way. I am passionate about life, I love to help people I care about, I am very bad though, at making friends. I don't talk very much, and it takes awhile to get to know me.

I can't seem to meet anyone who I can keep a connection with. We all need friends, you can't just go through life all on your own without sustaining considerable damage to your psyche. 

So if you'd like a funny, kind, creative, blue-haired, pot smoking gal who rarely speaks to be friends with, here I am. I'm willing to give all you weirdos a try. Unless you're creepy, or just not very nice. Then fuck you.

I am a good guy that is just now learning some tough lessons about how to redirect life towards permanent change and away from the streets. What type of feelings and emotions do you got bottled up that could use a release? I am intelligent and have a broad level of understanding that touches base on a little bit of everything. Want to vent? Got any issues that need conversation without a clause? Let's talk. I am a conversationalist and writer at heart. Not looking for anythig serious; just good ole conversation. T.T.Y.L.

Hi everybody. 

Winter is a slow boring time for me. My job is seasonal so I've got a lot of down time right about now. I'd just like a chat partner through email. 

I'd prefer if you were married or in a relationship. This isn't an elaborate plot to cheat on our spouses, just makes it so we're on equal footing. 

That said, innocent flirting and sexual discussion would certainly not be unwelcome. On good thing about the initial anonymity is that we can say anything we want without retribution. 

I live east of the mountains so I won't use this as an excuse to get you to meet up, but I do make it over to Seattle on occasion so if it ever came up I wouldn't be opposed.

Anyway, just for chat. If you're interested let me know.

Please and thank you.

Hey there. Spring is almost here and that means outdoor adventures are soon to be had! I am new to Centralia and don't have a lot of friends here so I'm looking for some new PLATONIC outdoor activity friends, male or female. I'm going to reiterate myself and stress that this ad is in the strictly platonic section, so I'm not interested in hooking up with anyone. 

Anyway, I'm 35, female, not in great shape at the moment but that's why I need hiking friends. I refuse to go hiking alone as: #1 It's boring and #2 It's unsafe for a woman to go wandering around the woods alone. I don't want to take the risk. I might bring my friend's dog (Australian Shepherd) along with me occasionally, as he doesn't get out often and needs the exercise and socialization. 

Hoping to hear from someone! Thanks!

Massages are awesome - we all know that and if we can get them for free - they are super awesome!

This is not sexual ... period!
I'm not crazy ... you'll find out the moment we meet (and we ofcourse meet in public first!)
I'm decent looking (if that matters) and I'm absolutely clean (I know that matters!)

We pick times to meet up and we relax each other - if you have never done it its fine. I'm not looking for a pro - just someone who is willing to try. I'm fine getting 30 min massage each time and giving 60 minutes.

Update: I've posted before, but only to have people flake out. I have no idea why it's so hard to find someone willing to give as well as get a massage. You can go second so you get the most time and a better experience if you like. It's a rainy, grey day. Let's try and have a little relaxation. Nothing more is expected.

Hello,

I'll keep this short and sweet. I doubt it will go anywhere anyway.

I am single, fit and have a nice home in Silverdale. I have a massage table and give an amazing rub! I work out regularly and also like to stay very active. 

Not only do I love to give massage, once in a while I would love to get one! I hate paying for them as I think sometimes the best are between friends who aren't watching the clock and who will listen when I give them direction on what feels good. Honestly I have had problems with both when paying.

So, we can be friends who enjoy each others company and conversation, or we can just be two people who need a nice, no pressure massage. 

Not to sound like a jerk, but I do want a massage. Not to rub on you for over an hour, hop on the table and after 5 minutes of light passes of the hands, have you say you're tired. Nor do I want to get up and have you grab my privates and think that's all I'm there for.

Don't worry if you're inexperienced or don't think you have the hand strength. I can teach you what to do and how to use your weight to do the work without hardly any stress to you at all. How do you think professionals do this all day every day?

If you are interested in this, I would love to hear from you. We can chat a bit, meet somewhere public and safe for us both and see how we click. Honestly, I would love a massage today if you're up for it!

Thanks for reading and take care,

Hey hey, 

So basically I just moved to here from out of state, the economy here is dope! Haha, anyway it would be nice to talk to a female & possibly kick it.

About me, 6'3"", 34yrs old, no kids, lean, nerdy geek 

Obviously I'm not Idris freakin Elba but I'm told I'm similar just without the mustache...

(Not putting your photos online until you trust someone is smart right? Lol)

I love sci-fi (doctor who, firefly, Star Wars etc), horror movies, binge watching Netflix, video games etc

I do get out lol, but would rather hit the low key bar scene then a club. Hiking is cool, camping, road trips, nature stuff etc

I like 420....actually shocked at how many people are comfortable with it here lol. 

I come from a Gilmore girls-ish town on the east coast so trust when I say it's shocking how much weed is around lmfao

Anyway I'm looking to chat with a nerd, true nerd/geek is hard to find. 

Don't care what ethnicity you are or the shape you're in. Just want to chat with same minded people & see where it goes.

In search of single, active, straight guy to be friends with.

I moved here a few years ago and have been very career focused. In that time the small circle that I did have has gone in a million different directions and hey, that is life. Finding someone with similar interest would be ideal. 

A little about me: Late 20's, professional, travel frequently, spontaneous, sports fan, comedy junky, trivia/history nerd, story teller, pragmatic as fuck, snowboarder, hiker, as much a believer in fitness as craft beer, indiscriminate music listener, unapologetic man's man, and unwilling to affiliate with any political party.

I don't have a problem flying solo and frankly it never stops me from doing things, it just seems very difficult to expand your social circle as a single adult. If you are in the same position and don't think I sound like a complete asshat give me a shout. Cheers!

So I work 6 days a week from 4am to 11pm. Off on Monday's only. Don't have much of a life as you can imagine. I've been doing this for so long that I've forgotten what it was to sit and chat with a lady. Yes what I'm looking for is a LADY, no I'm not interested in sex just harmless chat over coffee, dinner or a glass of wine. Some days I get lucky and can leave work early, and it usually happens when I'm anxious about something and needing someone to talk to. I've noticed that because of my schedule that over the years I've lost all of my friends and can't find anyone to chat with. This makes life very lonely. 

A bit about myself, I'm a workaholic as you probably figured out. I'm well traveled and love the arts. I'm 50 and I'm not much of an athlete but I'm 6' tall and 200 lbs. , I don't think I'm overweight but I'm not a twig either. I think they call it HWP on CL. So if you are interested in some evening chat, maybe a movie, dinner, wine, coffee or the like, drop me a line. BTW anything we do is my treat. It's a cultural thing so don't think because I pick up the check I want anything more than a nice evening with a nice lady. I don't care how old you are just be between 25 and 70. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this and happy life to all.

I'd like to meet a nice lady and I mean LADY who likes to chat over coffee or a glass of wine in the evenings a couple of times a week. I'm am extremely busy person and rarely have time to meet people. On occasion I'm able to leave work early and I find myself not tired enough to go to bed so I drive around looking for something exciting to do but its never fun when you are alone. I have absolutely no interest in sex or marriage but a good friend to unload the daily drama. Just someone to chat with. I like going to dinner, movies, sharing a bottle of wine, and if not too tired a dance or two isn't out of the question. I enjoy art in almost every form, politics but don't like to bring it up unless we are 100% compatible in that department. I've done quite a bit of travelling , usually off the beaten path with little funds so I have a bunch of anecdotes we can share. I'm a good listener and enjoy hearing others play their tape. So if this is something that piques your curiosity drop me a line. Again NOT interested in sex, not gay either but I just have to know someone very well before anything happens or at least year from the time we meet. 

Adios!

I only race myself and am a moderate endurance rider. 10-20-30 miles and I plug into music usually. 

Just thought I'd put it out there if someone needed a reason to ride and get into better shape.

Hi.

Join me for a morning drink!

I work nights, and around 10 a.m. have a glass of red wine to slow myself down a bit and get to sleep for my next night shift.

I am tired of doing this alone.

I would like to pour another glass for an average-sized local lady who can join me for a drink at this time without adversely affecting her schedule or life. I'll happily serve you a glass of my current cabernet, or pour you the drink of your choice.

Cheese, crackers, grapes, avocado - all entirely feasible.

If you are a talker, we can talk. If not, we can turn on Netflix and see what's new. I am not trying to slink my way into a date - if I want to do that, I'll be up front about it. I'm really not looking for that now. This is truly about no longer needlessly spending this time of day alone. 

I am a very well employed, tidy, clean, decent-looking guy (descriptors which fit my home, as well) and am asking for you to pen a quick sentence or two about yourself, and a pic if you are interested. I know there must be a lady out there who wouldn't mind joining me for a free, mid-morning drink. 

Any age from 21 up to my own (47) is just fine.

Please let me know a bit about you and your favorite drink. If we seem like a fit, let's talk!

Please remember to include a pic for consideration! 

Thanks for looking!

I'm always there for friends, and I've been known to answer the phone in the middle of the night. I'm a great listener and enjoy helping people navigate through tough times and love celebrating the good times. I don't miss events that are important to close friends and sometimes acquaintances. But it seems that things don't always go both ways. I know who the reliable people are and of course they are a high priority, but sometimes I just help too much when maybe I shouldn't.

Of course the obvious answer is to keep being there for people and know when to cut people off. But it it gets old sometimes, right? 

Anyway, tell me what you think. What's on your mind? And if you have something completely unrelated and need to talk, I enjoy listening. I just can't put my number on here because I'd get some strange calls from CL people, I'm sure. And no, I'm not ugly :P

So I work 6 days a week from 4am to 11pm. Off on Monday's only. Don't have much of a life as you can imagine. I've been doing this for so long that I've forgotten what it was to sit and chat with a lady. Yes what I'm looking for is a LADY, no I'm not interested in sex just harmless chat over coffee, dinner or a glass of wine. Some days I get lucky and can leave work early, and it usually happens when I'm anxious about something and needing someone to talk to. I've noticed that because of my schedule that over the years I've lost all of my friends and can't find anyone to chat with. This makes life very lonely. 

A bit about myself, I'm a workaholic as you probably figured out. I'm well traveled and love the arts. I'm 50 and I'm not much of an athlete but I'm 6' tall and 200 lbs. , I don't think I'm overweight but I'm not a twig either. I think they call it HWP on CL. So if you are interested in some evening chat, maybe a movie, dinner, wine, coffee or the like, drop me a line. BTW anything we do is my treat. It's a cultural thing so don't think because I pick up the check I want anything more than a nice evening with a nice lady. I don't care how old you are just be between 25 and 70. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this and happy life to all.

I'd like to meet a nice lady and I mean LADY who likes to chat over coffee or a glass of wine in the evenings a couple of times a week. I'm am extremely busy person and rarely have time to meet people. On occasion I'm able to leave work early and I find myself not tired enough to go to bed so I drive around looking for something exciting to do but its never fun when you are alone. I have absolutely no interest in sex or marriage but a good friend to unload the daily drama. Just someone to chat with. I like going to dinner, movies, sharing a bottle of wine, and if not too tired a dance or two isn't out of the question. I enjoy art in almost every form, politics but don't like to bring it up unless we are 100% compatible in that department. I've done quite a bit of travelling , usually off the beaten path with little funds so I have a bunch of anecdotes we can share. I'm a good listener and enjoy hearing others play their tape. So if this is something that piques your curiosity drop me a line. Again NOT interested in sex, not gay either but I just have to know someone very well before anything happens or at least year from the time we meet. 

Adios!

Am interested in finding someone who enjoys cycling as much as I do and can ride daytime mid week as the weather permits. I'm married, kids, not seeking a hook up and genuinely hoping there is someone who enjoys riding, the trail and having some conversations here and there. 

I only race myself and am a moderate endurance rider. 10-20-30 miles and I plug into music usually. 

Just thought I'd put it out there if someone needed a reason to ride and get into better shape.

Hi.

Join me for a morning drink!

I work nights, and around 10 a.m. have a glass of red wine to slow myself down a bit and get to sleep for my next night shift.

I am tired of doing this alone.

I would like to pour another glass for an average-sized local lady who can join me for a drink at this time without adversely affecting her schedule or life. I'll happily serve you a glass of my current cabernet, or pour you the drink of your choice.

Cheese, crackers, grapes, avocado - all entirely feasible.

If you are a talker, we can talk. If not, we can turn on Netflix and see what's new. I am not trying to slink my way into a date - if I want to do that, I'll be up front about it. I'm really not looking for that now. This is truly about no longer needlessly spending this time of day alone. 

I am a very well employed, tidy, clean, decent-looking guy (descriptors which fit my home, as well) and am asking for you to pen a quick sentence or two about yourself, and a pic if you are interested. I know there must be a lady out there who wouldn't mind joining me for a free, mid-morning drink. 

Any age from 21 up to my own (47) is just fine.

Please let me know a bit about you and your favorite drink. If we seem like a fit, let's talk!

Please remember to include a pic for consideration! 

Thanks for looking!

I'm always there for friends, and I've been known to answer the phone in the middle of the night. I'm a great listener and enjoy helping people navigate through tough times and love celebrating the good times. I don't miss events that are important to close friends and sometimes acquaintances. But it seems that things don't always go both ways. I know who the reliable people are and of course they are a high priority, but sometimes I just help too much when maybe I shouldn't.

Of course the obvious answer is to keep being there for people and know when to cut people off. But it it gets old sometimes, right? 

Anyway, tell me what you think. What's on your mind? And if you have something completely unrelated and need to talk, I enjoy listening. I just can't put my number on here because I'd get some strange calls from CL people, I'm sure. And no, I'm not ugly :P

Hm, where do I start? Would love to meet new friends and have a good time. ln a committed relationship and would like it to stay that way, but something is just missing. I love my boyfriend, but there's lack of communication and romance. would love to find that person to make me feel butterflies again.

A little about myself
I know I'm beautiful. I'm very outgoing and love to flirt. I like being out of the house and sightseeing. Typical date would be hiking and a picnic, that's just me(since it's too cold out, maybe something indoors for now like go carts;)) My cooking is great, so I've been told. I do have 2 girls, 3 and 1. 


If interested, send me a pic and a little about you and if i find you interesting, I'll send you one. To know you're real, put your ethnicity in the subject. I will not reply without a face picture as I pay more attention to it ;) That means no dick pictures, I can go watch porn for that lol. Hopefully one of you will have some free time :) lost interest in some people on here.

Hello, I was just thinking how nice it would be to have a friend around this area,
someone I can email a little, maybe even do some texting to ask how her day was,
just chat about what ever we feel like, with out there being anything else.
I have never just had a female friend with out hooking up at some point,
and I in joy chatting with women, I just don't understand why we can't just be friends,
why it always has to be about me being single or not, like I have to be on your plate 
in order for you to talk to me, why dos it matter if I'm with someone or not,
why can't we just be friends with out dating and sex.
I just don't understand why I can't ''just'' have a woman friend ?
Maybe someone else knows why?

I enjoy laughing and having fun when I get high and would like to with a good looking girl this morning. No strings attached.
I am 49 and married, but my wife does not know I get high and She will be at work anyway. I am not looking to have sex with you. I only want to have fun and I have some good weed that I've had for too long since I only take a hit or two a week for testing reasons.
If your up for it, reply to this ad and tell me about yourself. A picture of yourself will work too. If you send me a pic, I will send you a face pic of me too so you can see who your dealing with. We can meet at a Starbucks or similar for safety reasons and go to my house afterwards for an hour or two. Who knows, maybe we will become good friends!

Bored in life? Can't relate to people around you? Can't relate to this world? Stuck in a rut, don't know how to get out of it? Not depressed but almost there? Feeling lonely? No one can really understand what you are going through?

I've been there. I've gone through it all. I've been to hell and back. I've lived some of the toughest things, bar physical injury, that anyone probably has ever lived. Some folks will probably spend multiple lives before they run into what I went through. With that came acceptance and non-judgement of other's situation. I am curious and I love to hear other people's stories.

Hello!
My name is Ryan and I'm a personal trainer trying to build my own, local client base.

I've been personally working out and passionate about health, physical fitness, and working with others in pursuit of their goals for over 11 years!

After working with friends for a few years, I decided this was a career path I really enjoyed and wanted to follow after. 
I've earned my certification and am now ready to start helping you change your life!

I specialize in weights/cardio/kickboxing/mma, much more geared to fun, applicable workouts to burn fat and build muscle quickly.

While I take an observant approach to help determine your current states and goals, I'm a very involved trainer and will do the workout right next to and with you.

Most of my clients prefer this way as it keeps more of a team effort than simply you doing workout with a drill sergeant yelling at you.

I'm listing several ads, trying all I can to get myself out and help others.

Please, don't flag my ads, competition is good for us all.
Please help support, or let your friends/family know who are trying to change themselves and their lives.

I want to and am passionate about empowering people to take control of their lives.

My workouts are fun, exciting, effective, and I'm excited to meet and help you realize your goals!

Please feel free to reach me by phone or text, email is also acceptable.
I have an open schedule due to training full time so 24hr gyms and schedules are even doable for night shift people wanting to improve.

My prices are extremely fair and I'm always willing to work with groups on price or buying a few sessions at once.
Please call, text, email with any questions.

Love and respect,
Ryan

If you are feeling stressed then this massage is for you. I would love to give you a truly relaxing and satisfying hour of pleasure on my table. I use warm oil and soft music and candlelight to make you feel totally at ease. All you need to do is let me know when you are available and the relaxation can start.

Relieve stress and body pain today with a full body therapeutic massage. Stress and muscle tension can make you sick and uncomfortable. Massage therapy will help you relax and release all that built up tension. My therapeutic sessions are tailored to you ~ whether you want deep tissue, lighter relaxing touch, stretching or any combination that best suits you.

Let me bring the massage to YOU! Just sit back and relax! I am a 39 year old professional white male. I have a very caring approach to your individualized needs. Every session is Private and Discreet. Type ""I would love a massage"" in the subject line so I can weed out the bots. Thanks for considering my service and have a nice day.

I'm looking for a unique kind of relationship. Basically, I'd like to meet a woman who wouldn't be shy or feel guilty about asking me to do things for her from time to time. It could be housework or errands. And I don't want to be paid. I've tried this kind of thing a couple of times before, and enjoyed it. Maybe there something you don't like doing yourself. Maybe you just like the idea of someone working for you and doing what you ask. I am talking small things. I won't help you move, and I won't paint your house. But if you want me to, for example, do your dishes, or wash your car, or bring you lunch, or carry your bags in the mall, I will. Tell me about yourself, and I'll tell you more about me.

Greetings.

I relocated here from a much warmer state. :) My few good friends are all by phone, these days. I'd love to know even one person to go for walks with, or meet for a tea or coffee, and speak to, in person! I should say that I'm usually most comfortable with women friends...age doesn't much matter, nor do the other details.

I'm 43, have two dogs I adore (lab and German shepherd), and a husband. No kids, unfortunately, and very little drama and slim tolerance for it. I'm probably too much of a homebody, so could stand to change that, a bit; I don't work, and so the combination of these things makes it tough to meet potential friends.

I love vintage 20s/30s music, also some classical, bluegrass, 50s country, 80s pop...a variety, really.

I'm a low key person who enjoys solitary pastimes--reading, watching my soaps (yeah, I'll admit it--I even watch a British one. LOL), baking, writing, visiting thrift stores and antiques, etc. I'm trying to teach myself German. :)

I'm content, for the most part, but would welcome some companionship. I'm not so particular as to be only looking for a clone of myself; I'm interested in learning new things, hearing about what my friends enjoy. I'm a decent listener, too, I think.

I'm pretty easy-going, but I do want real life friends, not just texts or email. Occasional texts are fine, but I prefer phone calls. Please get in touch, and let's see what happens!

I am REALLY reluctant to post this ad because I am SO against drama, but I really want a friend that I see on a regular basis. I have some amazing friends, but I just don't see them enough. So, I really hope to find a true friendship here where we can hang out AT LEAST bi weekly. :) 
A little about me, I'm 27 years old. I'm married to the most amazing guy in the world and together, we have the coolest and sweetest five year old little girl. I am a complete doofus and love to make people laugh. I love to blog (tumblr for the win), color, write poems, take pictures (HUGE passion of mine), cooking, and baking. I'm really creative and apply that in much of what I do. I'm a total caffeine junkie and drink lots of Starbucks. I've been told I make amazing coffee at home too. :) I LOVE metal music. My favorite bands are From Ashes To New, I Prevail, Five Finger Death Punch, and Bring Me The Horizon. I love going to concerts and saw Five Finger Death Punch last year. We are going to Slipknot this year. :) I have a huge heart and love silly things like Pokemon and My Little Pony. (I am getting a tattoo for both). I'm extremely loyal and blunt as fuck. I DO NOT sugar coat anything. I am a realist and believe in accepting life. I have struggled a lot in recent years, having been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. That set my life back by about 3 years, but I woke up one morning and was like, to hell with this. I'm going back to school soon for family therapy. It's my life's purpose to help others. :) I am 4/20 friendly... I just don't want it around my kid. I accept all types of people. I have trangender, intersex, and non-binary friends. I also like D/s (dom/sub) and would need a friend who accepted these things about me and them. Lastly, I am really finally getting my life together and NEED a friend who wants to share in the good things in life and keep me smiling through this part of my life. I don't need baggage. I need smiles, good memories, and love :D I will obviously return the favor. 

Please DO NOT email me if you're looking for any of the following -
- Drama or someone to gossip too. 
- If you're someone who can't handle the truth. Little bitches ARE NOT welcome in my life. 
- If you plan to involve me in your infidelity. I pride myself on being loyal and trustworthy. If you have ANY intentions of being more than friends, I am NOT the person for you. 
- If you wanna go on and on about your baby momma drama or relationship bullshit. (Now.. let me clarify, if you're having a hard time with a fight or something, I will absolutely support you, but there's a difference between that and a CONSTANTLY unstable and toxic relationship. Know the difference). 
- If you want someone to get plastered with. I DO NOT drink or want any part in it. 
- You are judgmental and not okay with all types of people and dynamics. 

PLEASE DO email me if -
- You want a truthful, positive, long lasting, drama free, friendship.
- You want someone to game or color with.
- You want someone to get coffee with, watch netflix with, or cook/bake with. 
- You are okay with kiddos and or have some of your own.
- You want puppy play dates. 
- You love to laugh and want to laugh so hard your sides hurt. 
- You want someone to drive around with blasting tunes and annoy people. lol
- You are accepting of all people. 
- You are an adult and know how to handle a real friendship. 

If you're still interested, please send me an email. I can send my kik or number. I'm a total textaholic. :) Have a wonderful rest of your week and thanks for reading. :D

Hey, thanks for clicking on my post. Hopefully this is the first step in making a new friend.. Unfortunately, my work and school schedules are crazy Monday - Thursday, so I'm hoping this will be a good way to meet some new, cool people. BTW, crazy weather we're having?!?! Should be nicer starting tomorrow (Tuesday). So, I know that this Craig's List and this section isn't really for platonic friends anymore; it used to be but I guess not so much now. However, I still have faith that there are still people out there, like myself, that are just looking for friends. Ok, I moved out here a few years back and I make some really good platonic friends on here back then. Unfortunately, they've either moved away to Ballard (you know some place so far away that they refuse to leave their new The Shire to come back to visit the old one) or they actually moved away (out of the area). Again just to be clear, I'm truly just looking for platonic friends to do stuff with. Absolutely no funny business. Period. I'm a laid back, non-smoking, educated, progressive, ""lefty"", black guy looking to expand my circle. Bottom line, I'm just looking for friends who would be up for grabbing a drink sometime, going to movies, running/jogging, soccer/flag football, working out, hiking, rock climbing and talking. Good conversation is essential; being able to discuss issues [and solutions] in technology, the environment, world events/affairs, non-commerical media, politics (again I'm a proud, educated progressive but very respectful of differing views). I know that's a crazy laundry list, but I'm truly open to meeting new, non-flaky people. If any of this sounds interesting and you're not a flake, please feel free to email me back. Thank you again for clicking and reading. I look forward to melting through the freeze and making some new friends.

Hey there

It's hard making friends at this age, especially if your not in school or at a regular job. I am a freelance photographer and currently working from home. Very artsy. Super laid back. Nothing really offends me. I am a generally nice and real person and looking for a friend who's similar. I have a boyfriend who I've been with for almost 4 years and we could really use other ""couple friends"" so if you are the same thats a plus. Love being silly and sarcastic. Love traveling and adventures. arts and crafts, movies, going out to eat, walking around green lake, I'm a fashion photographer (but never been super into fashion but its growing on me...) Love trips to goodwill, Obsessed with sugar gliders and own 2. Not afraid of laughing at myself. 

fav tv shows: the walking dead, Outlander, Gilmore girls, New Girl, love DIY network show, I like cheesy shows like ""married at first sight"", Love a lot of comedy but blanking on which ones haha. 

fav movie: never been kissed and cry baby 

boyfriend is an ex-skater boy, likes playing GTA on xbox, and watching scary movies, playing football for fun with some coworkers, soon to start a 2 year mechanics program, likes to pretend he can rap and sometimes tries to make music, he's from the east coast, likes making jokes and a super genuinely nice guy.

I'm 30, tattooed, don't smoke but i drink. I have bipolar disorder, I'm also bi but I'm not looking for a fwb or anything like that. Just a friend. I am married, it's a dead marriage and an open marriage so you don't need to worry about ruining anything. Again, i know this will sound strange coming from a male, but I'm not looking for sex, i just want a friend i can relate to. Talk to about life, stuff, hang out.

Hello,

I am a 27 year old man and due to some infidelity on her part, my wife has moved out. We are now separated and I have found myself completely alone out here in a cold home with no one else but my puppy dog.

I am not necessarily looking for a romantic or sexual relationship, though I wouldn't be totally opposed to one if it were to develop. I am mostly just looking for a cool person to hang out with. I'd love to snuggle up in the bed, under the heated blanket, grab some pizza and enjoy each others company as we watch something on the TV. Something like Mystery Science Theatre 3000, Rifftrax, Rick & Morty, Futurama or the like.

I am a pretty introverted guy who enjoys his alone time, but I don't like being completely on my own. I don't intend on replacing my wife or something, but meeting some new people out here would be good for me. To give you an idea of who I am, I am studying Game Design. I like video games, movies, TV, and most any other form of visual media. I draw, write, sculpt, and constantly look for other creative outlets for myself. I tend to prefer quiet nights in, entertaining myself with the things or people around my home. However, I can be convinced to go out for a movie, a meal, etc.

If any of this sounds like something you would be interested in, please, get in touch with me. Just reply to this posting or if you have kik you can find me at ""funnyhandlehere""

Working on the divorce paper-work. Legal stuff is so slow and boring. Living on my own again and that means I am totally alone.

I just need someone to distract me from all of this non-sense. Whether we ever meet or continue our relationship is up to you and our connection.

Put your favorite TV show in the subject line, so I can tell your real, or at least an intelligent bot.

I am 6'1"", dark brown hair, blue eyes, average build with a couple extra pounds that I am going to start working on losing.

I enjoy most kinds of visual media. Video games especially, they engage me more. Though I love a good movie or TV show if I am in a more laid back mood. Eating out and going to the movies is a standard night out. I am a creative person, I like to think, and have a long history in art.

My job is fairly flexible and allows for a range of activities through-out the day. As long as I have my laptop and an internet connection I can get things done. 

Some of my hobbies include hiking (beginner status); playing video games (mostly PC but only because I like owning money more than I like owning consoles); watching UFC; and going to comedy shows (looking forward to Joe Rogan in April). 

I don't drink but I am 420 friendly if you're down. I've been getting into going to the gym/ working out so maybe an exercise buddy would be nice.

I am looking for a musician friend. I love music but I have no family or friends that are musicians. I have been learning piano, organ, keyboard, music arranging, singing, and music theory on my own.

I am not using music for my own entertainment, but to reach out and help others. I know the true spirit of music is one of giving. Everything I learn, I share with others. I have already been asked to teach basic music theory, piano, and voice on more than one occasion. I do the best I can with the knowledge I have. I would love to find someone that believes in me and the work I do enough to want to help me. I love to learn. Things are always easier once someone shows you how. You will find me to be a quick, avid learner and grateful friend. I am sure you will find working with me a very rewarding experience. You will not only be helping me, but many other people as well. I am very religious but I am not judgemental. I don't care if you are religious or non-religious, gay or straight, just please remember I am only seeking a platonic friend.

I have a variety of interests other than music. I enjoy hiking, biking, and photography. I have traveled to Ecuador, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. I am currently learning Spanish.

I too have been kept busy with work and school, but things are beginning to settle, and I have a feeling that it would be nice to meet new people. Who does not like making new friends?

I am pretty open-minded, love movies, and I am getting back into reading regularly. I'm finishing up my undergraduate degree, where I'm an economics/philosophy/political science major. Running is something I am re-learning to do (I was previously an avid runner), and I am training for a couple 5Ks. I savor the experience of food, especially Thai, where I cannot resist a good plate of pad see ew or pad kee mao. I'm learning to cook and I like comic books, so I have a few geeky moments.

I enjoy witty banter, have hobbies, and genuinely ask questions, so conversation will never be short.

Looking for a female training partner for Brazilian Ju Jitsu. I'm taking a course online which gives detailed instructions on how to learn, but need a partner. BJJ is one of the most effective forms of martial arts and it's especially good for woman considering it teaches you to beat a bigger and stronger opponent. Real serious about learning and would like to keep this strictly platonic since I have a girlfriend which by the way knows I'm looking for a female training partner.

So I work 6 days a week from 4am to 11pm. Off on Monday's only. Don't have much of a life as you can imagine. I've been doing this for so long that I've forgotten what it was to sit and chat with a lady. Yes what I'm looking for is a LADY, no I'm not interested in sex just harmless chat over coffee, dinner or a glass of wine. Some days I get lucky and can leave work early, and it usually happens when I'm anxious about something and needing someone to talk to. I've noticed that because of my schedule that over the years I've lost all of my friends and can't find anyone to chat with. This makes life very lonely. 

A bit about myself, I'm a workaholic as you probably figured out. I'm well traveled and love the arts. I'm 50 and I'm not much of an athlete but I'm 6' tall and 200 lbs. , I don't think I'm overweight but I'm not a twig either. I think they call it HWP on CL. So if you are interested in some evening chat, maybe a movie, dinner, wine, coffee or the like, drop me a line. BTW anything we do is my treat. It's a cultural thing so don't think because I pick up the check I want anything more than a nice evening with a nice lady. I don't care how old you are just be between 25 and 70. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this and happy life to all.

I'd like to meet a nice lady and I mean LADY who likes to chat over coffee or a glass of wine in the evenings a couple of times a week. I'm am extremely busy person and rarely have time to meet people. On occasion I'm able to leave work early and I find myself not tired enough to go to bed so I drive around looking for something exciting to do but its never fun when you are alone. I have absolutely no interest in sex or marriage but a good friend to unload the daily drama. Just someone to chat with. I like going to dinner, movies, sharing a bottle of wine, and if not too tired a dance or two isn't out of the question. I enjoy art in almost every form, politics but don't like to bring it up unless we are 100% compatible in that department. I've done quite a bit of travelling , usually off the beaten path with little funds so I have a bunch of anecdotes we can share. I'm a good listener and enjoy hearing others play their tape. So if this is something that piques your curiosity drop me a line. Again NOT interested in sex, not gay either but I just have to know someone very well before anything happens or at least year from the time we meet. 

Adios!

Hi.

Join me for a morning drink!

I work nights, and around 10 a.m. have a glass of red wine to slow myself down a bit and get to sleep for my next night shift.

I am tired of doing this alone.

I would like to pour another glass for an average-sized local lady who can join me for a drink at this time without adversely affecting her schedule or life. I'll happily serve you a glass of my current cabernet, or pour you the drink of your choice.

Cheese, crackers, grapes, avocado - all entirely feasible.

If you are a talker, we can talk. If not, we can turn on Netflix and see what's new. I am not trying to slink my way into a date - if I want to do that, I'll be up front about it. I'm really not looking for that now. This is truly about no longer needlessly spending this time of day alone. 

I am a very well employed, tidy, clean, decent-looking guy (descriptors which fit my home, as well) and am asking for you to pen a quick sentence or two about yourself, and a pic if you are interested. I know there must be a lady out there who wouldn't mind joining me for a free, mid-morning drink. 

Any age from 21 up to my own (47) is just fine.

Please let me know a bit about you and your favorite drink. If we seem like a fit, let's talk!

Please remember to include a pic for consideration! 

Thanks for looking!

I'm always there for friends, and I've been known to answer the phone in the middle of the night. I'm a great listener and enjoy helping people navigate through tough times and love celebrating the good times. I don't miss events that are important to close friends and sometimes acquaintances. But it seems that things don't always go both ways. I know who the reliable people are and of course they are a high priority, but sometimes I just help too much when maybe I shouldn't.

Of course the obvious answer is to keep being there for people and know when to cut people off. But it it gets old sometimes, right? 

Anyway, tell me what you think. What's on your mind? And if you have something completely unrelated and need to talk, I enjoy listening. I just can't put my number on here because I'd get some strange calls from CL people, I'm sure. And no, I'm not ugly :P

I live in Puyallup and looking for anyone that enjoys thrift store shopping as much as I do. I am a female in my 30's, very normal no drama at all. Please be willing to come to Puyallup and send a pic so I see who I am talking to. Thanks!

I need to loose about 30 lbs, and also just love water! I am a fun, playful, friendly 38 year old woman,Looking for someone to swim with Tuesday morning from 8-9am, and Thursday evenings from 6-7pm. Like regularly. I dont feel like I can do more than an hour or hour and a half because I have an auto immune condition and fatigue. Hoping to get a friend or 2 to do it with, and perhaps even on other day but this is a good start. If interested write me here! I will give you my phone number. -ps... I have a membership at Lynnwood pool and that is where I hope to go, but come summer I am open to adventures at the local lakes as well.

I'm looking for a friend outside my marriage. My wife travels a lot and frankly isn't much engaged in the relationship anymore. She's not really aware I'm interested in finding a friend, but I am aware that she has a friend of her own. I'm 47yo white male, dark hair and in good shape. I'm a business professional and work full time and make a great living. I have a great sense of humor as well :-)

Have a great day

Hi. I'm a single 34 male looking to meet new people. Prefer to meet someone Korean so I can practice but open to meeting any nationality really. Most of my Korean friends are back in Korea or in other states so there's no one to go have Korean food with or practice my Korean with. I'm half Korean and half English. I speak Korean fluently and do enjoy some Korean dramas and movies as well. I'm clean cut, don't drink or smoke, but still like going out and having fun. Dive bars, martini lounges, shows, movies, etc.

Slow day at work and looking for some chat to pass the time. Im a decent guy, probably not like most on here. CL is pretty entertaining at times but would be nice to actually talk to someone cool. Pic exchange upon request only please.
Thanks for reading!
