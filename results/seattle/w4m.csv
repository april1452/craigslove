Hi,, there gentlemen, (and I do mean gentlemen.) how's it going? You will need to ask for a photo.. Oh. and I am just getting out of an exhausting relationship. I really just need some kind men to talk to and exchange emails with. If there's something that comes out of it then let's do it! (not literally!) So let me tell some things about myself, I am mixed, I'll tell you more through email, I have curves, some may call me fat, but I'm working on being something better to the ""Washingtonians eyes"", with saying that you may ask yourself where is she from? The answer: California. I've been in this state for almost 10years I have a little big man age, I'll let you know if you've taken some interest in this email. I'm very easy on the eyes, and you won't be ever sorry for meeting me, because not matter what happens out of this you can say you have a friend in me.! "" Quoted from Toy Story!!"" Btw I am in my early 30s and live in seattle. I have a car and I'm very mobile, would you ever consider working out with me at the gym sometime??

I've been really lonely and I miss falling asleep with someone. It's hard to fall asleep on my own.

Be really nice to meet someone who wouldn't mind hanging out and maybe staying the night a couple nights per week.

I don't want to have sex and it needn't be anything more, just a cuddle/sleeping partner.

I enjoy watching movies, working out, baking, traveling the world, hiking, books, board games, good food, museums, the dog park and spending time with friends and family. I don't drink, don't do drugs. Generally a pretty happy and laid back person. I'm a pretty cool girl and I'm an awesome and loyal friend.

Let me know if you're interested. I guess if I had to give a type I am in taller clean cut white guys, but I'm not exclusive to that.

About me- I have one child and am a great mother. I love animals and being active. I am also very competitive and enjoy gaming. I am pretty straight forward and won't say I love you unless I do, but I love hard when I do.

age: 30

I'm not great at talking about myself so here are some facts about me and if I seem intriguing to you please say Hi. I should note I am looking for something serious so please be looking for the same. No FWB or NSA here. 

So here it goes:

I'm 30 and a Pisces 

Fulltime Mom to an awesome 5yr old spirited little girl.

I am a BBW or some say I'm just Curvy but I will say I'm comfortable with who I am.

I have blue eyes and black hair.

I stand at 5'8.5.

I 24 tattoos and 14 piercings which are just in my ears, nose and brow.

I love Batman along with The Wolverine and Rorschach, but in all honesty Batman is and ALWAYS will be my #1 and Michael Keaton was the best! But Christian Bale is in 2nd place.

I enjoy being a dork and can be random at times.

Horror movies are my absolute favorite but I also enjoy Scifi and Comedies but I honestly do not have a favorite movie.

I enjoy all different types of music. I will note that Bohemian Rhapsody is pretty much my favorite song and yes I will sing it loud and proud.

I'm pretty awesome and outgoing, I'm easily amused. I like rides in the car or walking on the ferry. I like bowling and pool. Holding hands and PDA.

Purple is my favorite color along with my favorite shade, Black and 7 is my favorite number.

I enjoy spending time with my tiny family and my also weird and out of the box wonderful friends who are also not afraid to be random and silly.

I smoke cigarettes but I don't smoke Mary Jane but if you are friendly with her it's all good in my book I just don't smoke it. I also don't really drink I can't stand the taste since having my daughter and I refuse to drink and drive.

I live in the Lynnwood area technically Edmonds I'm on the border. I would really prefer you live somewhere not tooo far from me.

Your picture gets mine.

If I haven't scared you off or lost your interest then don't be shy and say ""Hi!""

Being sick sucks. Being sick and having no one to cuddle with is even more of a bummer!
But really, I'm a 33yr old bbw/ssbbw looking for a long term relationship. Romance. Laughter. Fun and simply enjoying the small things in life.

About me:
As stated above, I'm 33 years old.
I'm white with brown hair and hazel eyes that change from blue to green to grey depending on mood/what I'm wearing.
I am a big woman that loves to cuddle and just enjoy the company of the person I'm with.
I don't do drugs and rarely drink. DDF as they say, I do believe.
I love laughter and life, going on pointless drives, animals and definitely enjoy smaller town/country living to the city but I can find happiness most anywhere.
Games, movies and music are things I enjoy. I also love art and books/writing.
I have no kids unless you count my parrot as my child and here in the near future I have every intention of getting a couple of sugar gliders (so cute!) and a tarantula. They fascinate the hell out of me.

About you:
All I'm looking for is someone around my age, maybe a few years scaled either way. Ethnicity is of no consequence though I do have a thing for Asian men. I like to think that laughter is the best medicine and an open mind can get one far in life.
So if you like to laugh, are open to a long term relationship and like big women, hit me up!

As a side note, I like to take things at a slower speed when getting to know someone. I'm seeking a connection and someone that I can date long term, if not for the rest of my life.
Your picture gets mine.
Please put your favorite animal in the subject line. :)
I look forward to hearing from ya!

I'm going to keep this short and sweet. I'm looking for something that turns into a relationship eventually. Ideally I'd love to find someone with a good sense of humor that's up for random weekend adventures as much as they are lazy weekends in. I don't know for sure what kind of person would be best there, but tell me about yourself and if we seem compatible we'll go from there.

I'm 31 on the bigger side, but working on that. Short, sarcastic, can laugh at almost anything. No kids, no drama, have a full time job, a car, etc.. I have no idea what you want to know, but I'm an open book so ask away.

I'd love to find a man that I can fall asleep on the couch waiting for to come home from work that wakes me up with kisses. I love scary movies (psychological scary) and all types of music ( favorite is country rock and classic rock) ... When it's nice out I am outdoors ( hiking camping at parks beaches lakes) when it's cold im cuddled on the couch watching movies.. I need a personal heater when it's cold .. I am always cold lol.. I'll be going back to school soon and start bartending again soon, only been here for about 2 weeks still waiting for my van to get here to get things started. I've always been independent, except when it comes to falling asleep alone lol... I am an introvert very quiet and will keep to myself I don't really like to go out and party I've really never been about that... Maybe the bat every now and then with certain people, but will eventually open up to the right people. I love to smile laugh and be happy... It won't be a good relationship if u can't goof off together. If you want to know more or see a pic then feel free to message me.

Where are all the great fantastic guys? The perfect man that appreciates a big woman to hold and kiss. Every girl needs love and affection. Looking to work towards commitment to the perfect lover hopefully age 40-56. A man that will take control during intimate moments. A man who isn't lost in the drama of his past. Smelling and tasting good are so very important....Intelligence, confidence and creativeness is a must.

Me ~
I'm loyal, dedicated, honest, loving, forgiving, a great Mom, my dog loves me. I'm in medicine, so I'm a people person. I'm compassionate, a great listener. If you ask me something , expect me to tell it to you like it is.
I'm the marrying type ( Or I was. Maybe again one day) I would prefer not to be the girlfriend forever or dating forever type. I was raised to be the girl that raised a family and loved her husband. I believe in family dinners. I cook every night for my kids, clean my own house, do my own laundry. And I have a career.
But I also need adult time. I have a great sense of humor, I'm a bit of a smart a**. But I can take as much teasing as I give. The outdoors are a huge love for me. Hiking, Biking, Camping Skiing, Wine Country. Travel! Weekend road trips are a favorite.

My kids live with me full-time year round, I have 2 of them.There is no drama with my ex husband.


Who I'm interested in :o)
So here it is. I'm done with playing games. I know this seems harsh and direct. I just am at a point in my life where I want to be with someone that can handle their affairs. GET YOUR CRAP TOGETHER!! If you have a simple divorce and a couple of kids , Great! But leave the DRAMA LlAMA out to pasture and be ready to start something NEW. It's time to move on and let it go! Life is to short to waste!
Please make sure your kids are ok with you dating and that you don't have to sneak around to do so, or worry that if you ever introduce them to someone that they will hate them right off the bat , due to past hurts!

I have two wonderful kids from a previous marriage. They are the most important things in the world to me. So is my family.
So, I want someone in my life that I can do great fun things with. Who loves kids, dogs, an occasional gummy fruit flying from the back seat. Who likes weekend road trips, hiking, wine tasting, music, fun dates, bbq's with friends. Fishing is a new adventure for me, and I love it as do my boys. I would even be open to learning how to hunt!
So let's start with some honesty, be great at communication, you must love kids, dogs, traveling. Laughter and humor. Life is way to short to be serious all the time. Sometimes things happen, and seriously, you just have to laugh it off. Have a career, a passion, something you love to do. Be emotionally and financially stable. I'm ok with someone having kids, but I cannot have anymore.

I'm also ok with someone in the military.(Army, Marines or Air Force, Navy) Just please be stationed on JBLM or in the state of Washington. I understand deployments, and all that come along with it. ( Several emails have asked me that )

Oh how to attract the attention of the right person...

Let me begin by sharing what I'm looking for. I am HWP, honest. I am looking for the same or close to it. Not only for physical attraction but if you're into being physical, we probably already have something in common. My main man is my awesome dog. If you have a female who is the center of your world, hopefully she too has four legs or is under the age of 18 and somehow related. Please no bored married men or men in LTRs. This isn't Utah after all. Speaking of which, I'm not big into organized religion and we would probably get along if you weren't either. I love the earth, mother nature rocks it! Kids are awesome, we are a package deal. Period. Smoking is unacceptable. As are drugs, how old are we now? I really couldn't care less what you do for a job, but having one is a good thing. Age is a number, really it is. I tend to like younger but I'm here so anything goes. 
Nice People only need to apply.

One additional point I'd like to make, I am NOT looking for a FWB only. If you are, please don't waste your time or mine.

Hi there~

I am a 28 year old single female, no children. Employed, stable, have a car and my own place. I don't smoke or do any drugs. Healthy and active. 5'4, brown hair, brown eyes, olive colored complexion, nice legs and in shape. Fun loving, confident and great personality.

Seeking alike in male counterpart. Must be mature and stable, gainfully employed and carry no baggage. Handsome or cute. Taller than me is okay. Prefer white or latin but open to other races.

New to this part of town and seeking a nice guy to go on dates with and enjoy the weekends. It is actually my birthday this weekend and I am hoping someone is willing to show me a good time. I don't have any family or friends in this area, and my co workers are not exactly that friendly-or have family they tend to. Which leaves me to myself. 

I am interested in a nice dinner, movie, show etc. Does not have to be super organized

Nice girl deserves a nice guy don't you think?

If you are interested in taking me out, please email me your picture and when you want to meet up and I will reply with the same.

That is the progression I seek, with full of anticipations in discovering all qualities/substances of one another. Such joyous moments that would be.

With notifications of texts and e-mails, feeling my heart beat and smiling at kind words or silly jokes sometimes, I would like to feel alive. Whenever we meet, gradually, I want our affection to be stronger and more expressive to confirm our feeling and acceptance. There no rush.

I am an attractive woman with bubbly and exciting personality. I am always seeking for something amusing and mentally stimulating. And I wish to have an interesting, modern, professional, engaging, very fit and sexy, confident friend. Hopefully he is physically young but mentally mature.

There are so much more to enjoy in life. Why waste.

So I'm a bit country, lil bit of a tomboy still, enjoys rural life vs. big cities, do not like traffic and crowds. Much more comfortable and jeans, Georgia boots, and a hoody, summer time flipflops and a tank or t-shirt. Enjoy fishing, camping, lakes rivers, the bay/beach, clamming, shrimping, day hikes. Enjoy cooking, working around the place, Have home on acreage(still owe on) not looking to live between two homes. Hard working. Love family, kids, and animals. Looking for long-term, loyal, trustworthy, affectionate private and public. I want that connection and romance when out in public, that people might have to tell us to get a room. Looking for someone and only someone who shares same interest of rural living, the outdoors, doesn't mind a woman who can get as dirty as them, and willing to work side by side, sharing a life together. Not looking for endless texting, emailing, phone conversation, but someone who is genuinely looking for their last love. I will share pictures only once, I believe we share the same interest and commonality ( not sure if that is a real word, LOL) and also that you send a picture. I don't think you will be disappointed. But please tell me as much as you can what interest we share. I stay very active 52 - 59 yr old if you are active. Please list our common interest and a picture please, if I don't respond it's simply because I don't feel we share the same interest, and intentions for a relationship, If you answer with one sentence obviously we won't communicate, which is very important to me. And prefer someone that works, I afraid someone retired or SSI might not be compatible because I work and work hard and not always able to take off and go. I'm sorry for this but I will only respond to those who shares their interest that they feel we have A LOT in common and why ALSO with a photo. AND LOCATION is important.

Companionship: "" the state of being with someone""; she missed his company...

I am a single/divorced, in my early 40's, tall and quite thin gal, looking to find someone to catch the occasional (or regular) movie with; likely to share a drink and/or a meal now and again too; maybe to explore the foods and other offerings of the farmers market (or other 'outing' adventure), or just walk one of the many trails around here to take in mother nature. 

IF we should make a 'connection' then we could explore that further, but I am in no hurry, nor do I have any designs to make my life or yours topsy-turvy. 

Below are some characteristics and traits I seek and appreciate in another: 

~The ability to communicate your feelings, emotions, and needs without wanting/having to be domineering.
~HWP and on the taller side as I am. 
~Since I do not smoke, I ask that you be a non-smoker as well.
~Between 35 -- 55 years old; no more and no less, please.

I hope to receive your introduction with some relevant details regarding you. :)

Hello All,

I am a SBF seeking as SWM for a Long Term Relationship. I am 5'5, light skinned, with a few extra pounds. I'm mostly attracted to taller, stocky build, bearded, outdoorsy type of men. Someone that has strong positive values, can communicate effectively, has a zest for life, and overall, a good natured individual . 

I'm a big kid at heart, but can be serious when I need to be. I'm not a workaholic, but prefer to stop and smell the roses often. I enjoy home life as much as I enjoy being out in nature. Please be somewhat active. If you consider yourself a couch potato, hmmmm, we would not be a great fit. 

I enjoy traveling , camping, hiking, whitewater rafting, music, the Arts and exploring this beautiful state we live in. I'm a non smoker and light drinker. If you're the same, that's a major plus. Generally, I'm a happy and blessed individual . I'm easy to get along with and prefer a drama/stress free life style as much as possible. I prefer to make love, not war. I never go to bed angry. I prefer to address issues, find a solution(agree to disagree too) and move on. I'm affectionate, sensual, loyal and monogamous.

If you like what you've read, please send a picture and a little about you!!!!

May I start by saying that while I don't necessarily need a cat lover to hang with, you should at least understand and/or respect cats for what they are. They are not dogs, and if you're not ok with that, move on. 

Basically I'm looking for someone who will make me laugh AND also stick around. Apparently that's a tall order. I've got faults like anyone else, but I'm pretty sure I'm not that difficult a person to live with, unless you've got serious commitment issues (I'm monogamous to the core) or you absolutely hate cats. Some may think of me as boring (I won't go downhill skiing with you, or paddleboard Puget Sound), but I like to think of myself as ""comfortable"". Roadtrips are more my speed, with coffee in hand of course. I also like less strenuous hikes. Change the subject line if you email me so I know you're a real person who has actually read my whole post. And please forgive me if I don't reply right away. Emails with pics get considered first.

PLEASE don't message me if you're under 45. Or married.

I am a single female in the early 40s, looking for someone who is open to having a ""traditional"" monogamous relationship where you take the time to get to know someone, go out on dates, hold hands, enjoy each other's company, laugh with each other, have good conversations, maybe even take short trips. I'm not necessarily looking for happily ever after or even marriage, but I do appreciate having a quality companion who can supplement my life and hopefully I can do the same for him.

A little about me: I am independent, smart and educated, funny, strong willed, articulate/outspoken. I like to stay healthy and exercise regularly. Hobbies include cooking, hanging out with friends, travel, read, arts. 

A little about the ""ideal"" man: Someone close in age rage (30s-40s) independent, smart and educated, funny also. Also likes to stay healthy and keeps in shape. Shared similar interests/hobbies is nice, but I think it can be beneficial to try new things as well. 

If there's anyone interested in getting to know me for a potential companion relationship, I look forward to hearing from you! Please introduce yourself and tell me a bit about what you're seeking on CL.

If you are looking for a funny, sarcastic and sassy woman, you found her!?

I love to laugh and and try not to take myself too seriously. I'm looking for a guy that is a great balance of serious and fun loving. Who likes to flirt and have fun but knows when to take things seriously. Are you up for some adventures and exploring the cool places that WA has to offer? There are just so many places I have yet to see and would love to have a partner to share the exploring with.

I'm a very attractiveand young looking larger woman. I'm the full BBW package with a great personality. Now, you may be thinking that I need to prove that statement and will be asking for a picture of me. I will send you one if I find you interesting. Which is the long way of telling you that you need to tell me about yourself AND send your face picture first.

Just to give you a little more more about me....college educated, long ago transplant, self employed, animal lover, volunteer, spiritual, non drinking, non smoking, witty, fairly sarcastic, lover of all things quirky.

As for what I'm looking for in a guy.... fun loving, stable job, active, lives locally, non married or attached (aka single), non smoker, funny, affectionate, close to my age or a little younger, animal lover, someone I find attractive. 

If I caught your interest send me an email tell me about yourself and start a conversation that hopefully we can continue in person.

One final note, since this is CL, I'm not looking for a hookup or fwb.

Like the tittle says, I'm looking for a strong and caring man. Someone who doesn't need mommy to hold their hand for simple things, and who also knows how to be a gentleman. Small things like opening doors and compliments go a long way. It's not a one way street either. You should be okay getting compliments and treated with respect. 

People have good and bad days. Sometimes it's nice to talk and let go or be there for someone and listen. 

I love having lazy days inside watching movies or going outdoors and having an adventure. Car drives, trips up the mountain, and sightseeing are great.

I do have a stable job, my own car and my own place. Please have the same, no parents basements or anything like that. 

I'm 5'8"" blue eyes and blonde hair. My body is pretty average, because hey, sometimes that cheeseburger on the way home isn't so bad, and that's okay. 

Please attach something about yourself and a picture if interested. 

I'd like to get to know you and see where things go.

I do realize this is a long shot ! I'm a Christian woman (not boring or bible freak). I realize you stop being ""cool"" once you give your life to Christ, and have unpopular/ mainstream ideologies about life, especially living in a big city like seattle .



I'm compelled and up for the challenge of meeting someone, not necessarily uber ""religious"", but definitely spiritual, with awareness of a higher/ supreme being. 



Essentially, I am in search of a person with whom I can share a deep spiritual connection with and everything else will follow. 



Before you go throwing stones, I am well aware of the fact that I am posting on Craig's list. You see, Jesus in his days on earth didn't only hangout with the ""righteous"", he hung out with Everyone. No one is perfect, as long as they seek first the kingdom of God! 



Quick Stats: I Just turned 36 (look younger), Single, never married and no children, but hope to have some in the future. I stand 5""4 ,128 lb brown eyes, short black hair, considered attractive. As you may have gathered, I'm NOT looking for a quick fling or immoral ventures. 



Not much into club scenes, but I drink wine lightly in lounge or restaurant where we can actually hear each other. I like live shows like Broadway. Church activities, I enjoy theaters, restaurants, shopping, museums, traveling etc. 



I live in seattle but i'm in the City quite often. I work very hard and anyone who knows me will notice that although far from perfect, I am a strong and driven individual. I hope one day in conjunction with my future partner, build a fulfilling life. 



See, a lot of people are very lonely, we are all human but turn to others people, drugs, food, addiction, or alcohol ecetera. These are all temporary fixes. Happy to confirm that I am neither lonely nor need someone to ""make me happy"" or ""complete me"", that's what my relationship with God is for. 



It took a while, however I have learnt that no one could ever make you happy unless you really get to know yourself and find true internal happiness. Not even material things could come close to accomplishing this task. 



I know I've written a lot, especially for a ""personal ad"" on Craig's List and due to the non conventional nature of this content, I at least do not expect an overflow/ influx of meritless responses, and that's perfectly fine by me. 



Anyway, hopefully this post has touched at least one person's heart. Please, ONLY respond if you somewhat agree with the above, if you are a single Male aged 30-42, attractive (pictures a MUST), driven, looking to strengthen your spirituality, and are looking for something substantial in a potential partner. 



Oh! Remember, It's ok not to be ""cool"", wishing you Abundant Blessings! :)

Hi...gonna apologize in advance cause it's a bit of a long read....
First off I am posting in the dating/romance section, not casual encounters....not looking for a wham-bam thank you mam kind of thing. Not looking for instant gratification, or to hook up with the first guy to show interest, either (sorry, if that sounds rude/cold)....someone that will maintain interest...lol I know that sounds funny, like I am as fun as a sack of potatoes...lol I want someone real, something with meaning.
I am forty two, 190 and 5'2""...a big gal, and I don't mean I am tall...lol 
I AM SINGLE, YOU SHOULD BE TOO!!!!
I prefer white males, not looking for a gal or couple!!!!
I have a few guidelines...
I am not going to MEET you at your place or a hotel room!!! I am looking for dating/romance that means dating not meeting...lol
We're not having sex on our first date...no matter how much of a prince charming you are...lol
NO GLOVE, NO LOVE!!!
NO ANAL!!!!
I am not looking for long distance, want something that involves us seeing each other once or twice a week not once every two weeks....so change the subject to where you live (not your exact address...lol) Oh, and I'll just think you're a bot or didn't read my post and won't read your note to me...if you don't.
I probably should have started with this but I have HSV1.
Please, no haters telling me what a nasty fat slut I am...it makes me sad for you, how much anger and hate you must have to go out of your way and try and hurt someone you don't know. Besides, I might be fat but I am not a nasty slut...lol
Oh, and I have a life, you should too. That means I am not sitting around emailing all day...got work/chores...have to shower...do daily tasks...you know what I mean... lol

Let me tell it to you straight, no bullshit.

I am fat, but I'm pretty fucking awesome. I know for a lot of you the words ""fat"" and ""awesome"" don't go together and you guys can just stop reading now.

Yes I'm fat but I'm also pretty. And independent. And geeky. And pretty damn intelligent. I'm also a deep person who has very little interest in small talk and wants to delve into the kind of conversations that reveal the hidden facets of your personality and your desires. 

Despite the intensity, I'm constantly throwing about amusing banter since I feel completely rewarded when I make other people laugh. I also tend to talk about sex more than I should which can be a blessing and a curse. 

I'm looking for a guy who can accept all this and hopefully has many of the same characteristics. You should write to me if all of the following describe you:

-You are 33-49
-You are single and monogamous. For me that means your heart and your cock are not being given to someone else.
-You are ready for a capital R Relationship.
-You are articulate and you can actively participate in an email conversation before we meet.
-You are interested in meeting. Like, in person. For reals.
-You see truth in the following statement: R2-D2 is the real hero of the original Star Wars saga.

Write to me with the name of a favorite movie in the subject line and some questions you have for me. No questions get no response.

I am a SWF. 26 years old. No children. BBW; so if you are looking for a stick then you are reading the wrong ad. I am loyal and honest. Friendly and outgoing. Bubbly. College student. I am very 420 friendly. Family oriented and I'd do anything for a friend. I live on my own. I own my own car. My favorite color is blue, my favorite dish is lasagna, I love the smell of rain and I could play in it for hours, I love the smell of fresh cut grass so I really don't mind getting down and dirty when it's needed. I am not a girly girl. I like to wrestle around and enjoy my time wherever I am. I enjoy things like bon fires, BBQ's, being outside, going to the rodeo drive-in, music, movies, spending time together, and a lot of other things but let's save that so you have something to ask :) 

****you must be located in the kitsap area preferably Bremerton or Port Orchard****

I am looking for a man between the ages of 20 and 34. SINGLE. Employed. I don't mind if you have children as long as you want more ;) Pretty much have your life together and headed in a positive direction. 420 friendly. Enjoys being together. Looking for something serious. Gentle and passionate. Honest, trustworthy, and kind. Respectful. Must love dogs. Real man meaning I don't play games. Plain and simple. 

It is important to understand that no one is perfect and we shouldn't strive to change one another. Instead you learn to love the flaws. I want to be with someone who brings the best out in me and vice-versa. I want a long term serious relationship. I am talking eventually building a family. I don't want a fling, I don't want to sext, I don't want to be friends with benefits or f-buddies. I want something real. I need a real man ready for the real deal. I'm ready to start my own family and I'm sick of waiting while everyone else is getting pregnant and beginning their families.

Hey there, fellas!

I am in pursuit of a kind, fun, happy, intelligent, goofy guy pal with whom I might share some of life's amazing adventures!

A bit about me...I am a single mama. My munchkin is the most important person in my life. I am an outdoor enthusiast! I enjoy hiking, camping, and splashing in rivers! I like exploring new places and seeing all of nature's splendid beauty! I also love yoga, learning, reading, smiling, baking, playing around, and being silly! I'm quite responsible when it comes down to it, but I'm a firm believer that one simply must have fun and enjoy life!

I'd like to meet a cool guy to get to know, become friends with, and to have adventures with from time to time. Huge bonus if there's a single dad out there who would be up for park play dates down the road. I'm primarily just looking to make a good friend. I'm not exactly looking to jump into anything serious. And I am absolutely not interested in a casual fling.

Hello :)
So a little bit about me and what I'm looking for 

I'm 24. I'm intelligent, stubborn, hard working, dedicated, gym freak, loving, single mom
( meaning no dad in the picture, it's my child and I all day, every day)
Don't like kids?
Don't want to date someone who has a kid?
Don't understand that my kid comes first? 
Please move on.
Don't waste yours or my time.
I'm witty, a complete smart ass, I'm independent and bold.
I have a full time job, I'm perfectly fine financially. Don't need a sugar daddy. Thanks though. 

I would love to meet someone as obsessed about fitness as myself. 
I am not super tiny and fit, I have thick muscular thighs and a little extra meat from being out of the gym due to a torn muscle, an amazing ass ( get compliments on it regularly )
Lol!
But I am very serious about getting myself back in gear.
I want someone who loves the gym and would support me and my workout ethic and dedication, as I would theirs 
Plus seeing a hot guy workout is the sexiest thing ever to me, especially if I know he's coming home with me 
I want someone who can keep a conversation going. Who has a car, job and hopefully a place of their own. ( as I do )
Someone who is fun and adventurous.
Tattoos are a plus ;)

I'm missing some spark in my life, I've been single for so long with raising my kiddo alone. Want to start making time for someone in my life.
Doesn't have to be super serious.
But something for me, to feel like myself again. 

READ: please respond with your favorite color in the subject line. 
Please include a pic as well
will respond with mine 

You can't put a color in the subject line and attach a picture then don't expect a response. I assume your a bot or not smart enough to follow instructions.

Hello, My name is Amanda and after a couple years of being single I decided to give a possible relationship or maybe even love another go. I am a chubby girl, but to be honest I love working out and its something that I have been working on, but I do love me for who I am and if you dont like a chubby girl then I am probably not the best bet for you. Also I do not sleep on the first date, I am one to get to know you and be in a relationship before anything. I love when someone is funny, and I like someone who is more of a gentlemen then anything else. I am 28 Years old, and age normally doesn't matter to me, but if you cant be mature, then I am probably not the best bet for you. I work, and yes I am still in school. Dark hair brown eyes. If you ever want to hang out let me know, and we will do something fun! I like to pretty much do anything really I am super easy going. I even like to just stay in and watch movies rather then actually go out, I am also one amazing cook so if you ever want me to cook for you I can do that as well.

I am a SBF seeking as SWM for a Long Term Relationship. I am 5'5, light skinned, with a few extra pounds. I'm mostly attracted to taller, stocky build, bearded, outdoorsy type of men. Someone that has strong positive values, can communicate effectively, has a zest for life, and overall, a good natured individual . 

I'm a big kid at heart, but can be serious when I need to be. I'm not a workaholic, but prefer to stop and smell the roses often. I enjoy home life as much as I enjoy being out in nature. Please be somewhat active. If you consider yourself a couch potato, hmmmm, we would not be a great fit. 

I enjoy traveling , camping, hiking, whitewater rafting, music, the Arts and exploring this beautiful state we live in. I'm a non smoker and light drinker. If you're the same, that's a major plus. Generally, I'm a happy and blessed individual . I'm easy to get along with and prefer a drama/stress free life style as much as possible. I prefer to make love, not war. I never go to bed angry. I prefer to address issues, find a solution(agree to disagree too) and move on. I'm affectionate, sensual, loyal and monogamous.

I'm not looking for something causal or a hookup tonight--I'm looking to meet someone interested and open to dating (but we get to take time to determine if it's a good fit with us).

I am smart, kind, funny, artistic, ambitious, witty, direct, assertive and generous (please re-read ""direct"" and ""assertive,"" traits that do not mesh with everyone). I'm 5'6"", average build, dark-haired and pretty.

I like music and trees and water and food and bourbon and movies and epic adventures. Any overlap with you?

Generally, I'm a happy and blessed individual . I'm easy to get along with and prefer a drama/stress free life style as much as possible. I prefer to make love, not war. I never go to bed angry. I prefer to address issues, find a solution(agree to disagree too) and move on. I'm affectionate, sensual, loyal and monogamous.

Hi there!

It is so hard these days to find a good match. To find someone who will be honest, loyal and a good person. Too many people play games and can seem very heartless at times. I don't understand why people have to cheat and lie. If you don't want to be in a committed serious relationship than don't be in one. You can find plenty of people these days that want to do the casual thing. 

If you are looking for a serious relationship and want a good strong woman than please keep reading.

I am a 38 year old single female in Seattle that is looking for long term. I want to start out with a friendship (not fwb) and build from there.I am laid back and have a great sense of humor. I am honest, loyal, caring, hardworking and I treat people well. I enjoy a variety of activities including but not limited to fishing, camping, traveling, cooking, gardening, reading, bowling and spending good times with great people. 

I believe the key to a long lasting realtionship is communication, compromise, loyality and honesty. There also must be laughter. If you aren't laughing in life than you aren't living it. 

People say I have an old soul and that may be partly true. I am a little old school at times. I have morals but i am not uptight or a prude. I can be very playful and silly. 

I am a swf, 5'5 and 230lbs. I have long reddish brown hair and brown eyes.

I am a mother of one so single fathers would be great or a man who understands what it means to be a parent. I want a man who doesn't put on a front. A man who can just be himself. Someone who has morals and treats people well. A man who is laid back but also has the energy to have fun. Someone who will dance just to have fun whether he can dance well or not. Someone who can have a conversation and laugh together. A man who like outdoors activities and who can also be cool with just relaxing at home. Someone who is open to try new things and explore the world. Someone who has family values and is honest. If you like fishing that is a huge plus. I want someone who can be playful at times in all ways. Someone who can handle a woman who can be sarcastic and a bit of a smart ass when she is being playful. Someone who actually wants to fall in love and build a life with the right person. 

Email me if you would like to know more. 

Please put your favorite Song in the title so i know you're real. Your pic gets mine :)

Thank you for looking

Me too. 

If you are an extroverted introvert who has learned to be sociable, chatty and conversational, welcome to my party! I am an east coast transplant who arrived here in the mid 80's - went native, left behind all my worldly possessions and acquired new stuff along the way.

My world is populated with friends who appreciate me for my sense of humor, tireless state of mind, attentive and conventional alliance with the absurd and the serious. 

I am a mildly adventurous ordinary woman and an above average communicator if not clueless about the topic who enjoys mundane activities - movies at home, the performing arts, walking, dancing, home cooked cuisine, eating, smooching, and visions of the natural world that don't require mountain climbing or a 7 mile hike.

If you are looking for an off-line adventure, look forward to an RSVP that will turn my head with a nod in your direction

Sometimes we stay in. .

We have s** maybe even breakfast

We enjoy our time together 

And we respect one another's schedules 
And life styles

This is a proposal for a partime relationship
With long term potential

And to be clear this is not a hook up or casual encounter

Here's who I'm looking for to be my new friend

Well I finally made it home after a day of helping many ""friends"", which honestly I don't mind but not one wished me a ""happy birthday"". Other friends who realized it was my day invited me out to what was more convenient for them....don't get me wrong it is thoughtful but not what I wanted. I spent the day planning two weddings, one baby shower, one bachlorette party, recovering a missing dog, bringing cigarettes to a drunk neighbor, an argument with a GF's boyfriend, advice to my daughter, planning breakfast with friends when I really want lunch, fixing a friends car and finally I make it home only to realize I forgot to buy ice for myself so I can have a drink to celebrate my day alone.

I realize at this point being it CL I will have at least 30 men request a BJ to celebrate, 12 who will request phone sex, 8 will think if I send a nude I will be sooo much happier, 10 who will meet if I buy the drinks, 10 who will be nasty and call me fat, 10 are here just on ""business"" and will add to their expense account, another 11 who will be under 30 who are ""in"" to older woman, 4 will state they want to just please but are liars, 5 who need a place to stay, 5 who prefer men but will settle, 3 that are just bored, 2 who can't drive and one who may be nice enough to offer an ice cube under certain conditions. With that being said I look like a pedthedic human human who is now drinking a warm beverage hoping one man might be nice enough to send a thoughtful message though it serves no purpose because I don't feel I could actually invite someone to my space with an ice cube. I know he would never invite me to his because his girlfriend might find out All in all it is perhaps a waste of time but I do appreciate the 2 minutes of venting before I get flagged..

Cheers!!

Hello everyone!

I am a very busy divorced (of five years) mother (three children) who has a full-time professional career and is working on a masters degree in pursuit of a PhD. I am currently traveling around much for work and school and I am finding myself between the areas of Grays Harbour, Thurston and Lewis counties. Though in a few months it will all slow down and settle into one area. 

I have managed to squeeze in gym visits early mornings (5am), walks during lunch and audio lectures on drives, weekends devoted to my kids, but even in the chaos and busy-ness, I am lacking companionship; and truly I have no idea how to even start dating or move pass a first date. I have tried POF and OKCupid and random smart phone apps that connect me to people and it fizzles in five minutes. 

I am new to Washington state, but not my career, yet I am finding myself having to work harder here to put a smile on someone's face. The locals here are a tough crowd. The weather is even tougher for me, as I long for summertime heat and sundresses. 

I am hoping to find someone who is wanting companionship, who enjoys intellectual conversations as much as the mundane; Kid-friendly, good work ethics, spiritually-healthy and a believer in God. A man who is not bitter, closed-off, pining over an ex, or angry towards women--Maybe enjoys the countryside more than the city, appreciates art and expression, passionate and invested in himself and not afraid to get dirty.

Hi there,

I am new to dating. In fact, it's more of a rite of passage. I was in a strict religion in which I have gotten out and been given the blessing to go out and date.
About me: Young, college educated, attractive, innocent, drug free, don't drink, intelligent, interested in many things.

Looking for a mature, stable and intelligent guy who is going to take his time getting to know me and develop a relationship before we get into anything intimate.
Looking for genuine courtship and interest in myself.

I feel as though I am worth it as I am a virgin and have a lot to give to the right guy.

If you are interested to meet me and go on a real date with no real pressures to get intimate, please give me information on yourself, picture and why you would be a good fit for me and understand my situation.

No picture=no response.

I would like us to talk and text and then agree to meet in public place for a real date. I am free this weekend.

I am looking for a relationship-lite: someone to go out for dinner, walks, movies, date-like things. If we have chemistry, there's physical companionship as well! I'm not initially looking for a serious commitment, but if our relationship develops naturally in that direction, we can determine what we want. 

I am a very independent female who's not into drama, BS, flakes, liars. I have good instincts and I read people really well, so if you choose to contact me, you should keep it real to save us all time. Physically, I am petite but HWP, exercise regularly so would like to say I'm in decent shape for a person in her 40s. Personality wise, I am smart, professional, funny, loyal, honest, a good friend. 

Just an FYI, for those of you are interested in developing a physical relationship out of this, I need my head to be stimulated just like you need your other head stimulated. Just sexting or dirty talk with me ain't gonna do the trick. For those who don't have the patience or attention span to put in the work, no worries, there are plenty of simpler females out there.

If interested, please introduce yourself along with a pic! If you want to make sure I'm real first before sending a pic, please ask.

Perhaps this isn't the right place to post this, but I am in a real bind. Long story short, I find myself stuck in a borderline abusive relationship. He convinced me to quit my job, which I thought was sweet at the time but now realize that it was a method of manipulation, just to make me dependent on him. I hate that it worked. 

I need to get out as soon as I can. I do have friends with couches and could certainly find a place to crash temporarily, but I'd rather not freeload. I am an excellent cook (and I love to do it), very tidy, and I have years of administrative experience. I'm wondering if any of these skills/qualities might be helpful to a kind hearted man with an extra room in Seattle. I need to figure out a way to feed myself and to store my furniture and household items, but that is a secondary concern. I will begin looking for work immediately, so this will likely be a temporary situation unless we really like living together and decide to continue on. I do have two cats, and we are a package deal. I know that could be a dealbreaker for some.

I don't want to include any personal details here for obvious reasons, but if you think we could work something out, let's talk! 

How can I help you?

Perhaps this isn't the right place to post this, but I am in a real bind. Long story short, I find myself stuck in a borderline abusive relationship. He convinced me to quit my job, which I thought was sweet at the time but now realize that it was a method of manipulation, just to make me dependent on him. I hate that it worked. 

I need to get out as soon as I can. I do have friends with couches and could certainly find a place to crash temporarily, but I'd rather not freeload. I am an excellent cook (and I love to do it), very tidy, and I have years of administrative experience. I'm wondering if any of these skills/qualities might be helpful to a kind hearted man with an extra room in Seattle. I need to figure out a way to feed myself and to store my furniture and household items, but that is a secondary concern. I will begin looking for work immediately, so this will likely be a temporary situation unless we really like living together and decide to continue on. I do have two cats, and we are a package deal. I know that could be a dealbreaker for some.

I don't want to include any personal details here for obvious reasons, but if you think we could work something out, let's talk! 

How can I help you?

I would prefer a man that like to spend some free time with me, like watching a movie, coffee shop, come over for a nice cooked meal, and I could go out on the town with as well. I know that a lot of people commit their time to work, but all work and no play makes jack a dull boy.

So far all the fellows I've met weren't quite serious about dancing.
Before you respond, keep in mind the only type of physical I'm going to get with you is on the dance floor. 

Anyways, I struggle with depression and there's nothing more that I love than spinning around on the dance floor with great company. If we mesh well, I'm up for dating in the future.
I'm ready for a relationship and I'm tired of being treated like an option. 

I'd like to meet twice a month. This would be on a Tuesday, Friday, or Saturday evening, depending on the location. The location would be either downtown Olympia or Tacoma. 

I'm attracted to blue collar/countryish type 
For dancing purposes, I'm 5'10 and need a partner 5'10 or over. 
Personal preferences, I'd like you to be smoke free, beard free or well groomed facial hair, 5'10 or over stalky build, and ages 30 through 39, a handsome little devil with a great sense of humor.

Seeking to meet one man who is interested in and fully available to establish a bona~fide LTR. We both hold an intent to create a wonderous life of growth and adventure together!

On CL of all places?! Yes!! you never know who might be reading the personals:)

I am looking forward to having just one special man who will read this and resonate ! i do not 'need' a relationship; however i find that a primary relationship is a catalyst for growth. learning, and expansion. 

I am not idealized, overly romantic, nor seeking someone to 'complete' me. I am simply clear regarding the kind of person with whom I could deeply connect with and commit to. There is no reason to compromise one's standards. Why create unnecessary suffering through diminishing or devaluing one's needs ? Relationships are challenging enough! I miss companionship, shared experience, various forms of intimacy, and depth discussion.

I lead with a strong spiritual and psychological orientation to life. I offer an open heart, easy access to a full range of emotions, depth awareness of others; I am thoughtful, kind, sensitive, and a caring facilitator of interior growth (mine and yours). I have a service-to-others orientation; i find joy and ease in acknowledging others and seek to elicit a heart-warmed smile. 

I am deeply inquisitive and a adept listener. I seek to know another and be known. 

I am both a student and teacher of the constructs found within A Course in Miracles.

I am a highly educated woman with a successful career. My children are young adults and contributing world citizens. I have been liberated from the myriad tasks involved in effectively running a household, taking care of a large home, and daily active parenting. 

I am considered attractive, am tall and slim (5'8 / 125 lbs), with a nice smile and a feminine presentation. I take good care of myself and expect that you do the same. Self-care is equated with self-love. i have no addictions or mental disorders!

The man I desire shall have done plenty of his own work toward self awareness/actualization, continually seeking to become his highest Self. You have a strong spiritual orientation and apply this in your daily way-of-being. You are successful in your chosen career, have strong relationships with family/friends, and possess a kind, attentive demeanor. You are over 48 years old, so that we are in the same development mental framework. You reside within the greater Seattle area.

I appreciate responses that would introduce yourself in some detail, related to the qualities I offer and those I seek. The value of internet connectivity is that it allows for an initial level discernment. A two sentence response doesn't support discernment or becoming known.

I am definitely ""for real"", honest in my self description and clear regarding the type of man i would be a great partner to.

Not a fit with those seeking fwb, polyamory, extramarital affairs, atheists, or long distance relationships (over 50 mi).

Are there any good hearted, loyal men out there?  I just want a kind, gentle, sweet guy. I'm fit, slender, very laid back,  affectionate and loving. I want a simple man, I'm not interested in what kind of degree you have or your witty banter, or your fascinating career or how many big boy toys you own, it's your heart that will speak to me louder than any of that. I have a physical type I'm attracted to that generally falls under the category of ""gym rat"" I want a nice big strong man's arms around me at night. I want you to hold my hand and walk beside me and protect me wherever we go. If you are into the bar scene or the type of guy who frequents bikini baristas just stop reading here and have a nice day. I want the real thing, players need not apply. If you're for real I'd like to hear from you. Please include a pic, don't expect a reply otherwise.

To those of you who think this is easy well you are wrong, you are still here searching too, so what does that say? It says finding love is no easy task, but I believe it is worth the effort and therefore I keep trying and searching. What I am ultimately seeking is love, a deep abiding emotional connection to the man in my life. Don't hate me for being persistent, because I know what I want and I will keep searching until I find him and wont settle for less.

I am 54 with short brown/grey hair and green eyes, I am 5'3 and a large woman.
I don't smoke or do drugs, I do drink occasionally, I am drug and disease free, I listen to country music and some older rock, I work full time, I have a car, a place, the usual's and hope you do too. I enjoy drives to nowhere, the beach, leisurely walks, bowling, bingo, and many many other things and I am open to trying new things.

You:
single....no wife or girlfriend
taller than me
Between 40-60 years old
interested in a long term relationship only
family oriented
pet friendly
warm and compassionate
A good communicator
I am not looking for a pen pal situation or an email romance or just to be your texting/sexting buddy, or in starting a long distance relationship so please be within 50 miles of the Kent/Renton area. I will share a pic if you will. 

If you read the ad change the subject line to your favorite day of the week, if you don't then I will know you didn't really read the ad and will not even open your email. Thanks, look forward to hearing from you soon

Perhaps this isn't the right place to post this, but I am in a real bind. Long story short, I find myself stuck in a borderline abusive relationship. He convinced me to quit my job, which I thought was sweet at the time but now realize that it was a method of manipulation, just to make me dependent on him. I hate that it worked. 

I need to get out as soon as I can. I do have friends with couches and could certainly find a place to crash temporarily, but I'd rather not freeload. I am an excellent cook (and I love to do it), very tidy, and I have years of administrative experience. I'm wondering if any of these skills/qualities might be helpful to a kind hearted man with an extra room in Seattle. I need to figure out a way to feed myself and to store my furniture and household items, but that is a secondary concern. I will begin looking for work immediately, so this will likely be a temporary situation unless we really like living together and decide to continue on. I do have two cats, and we are a package deal. I know that could be a dealbreaker for some.

I don't want to include any personal details here for obvious reasons, but if you think we could work something out, let's talk! 

How can I help you?
