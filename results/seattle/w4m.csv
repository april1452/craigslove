Hi,, there gentlemen, (and I do mean gentlemen.) how's it going? You will need to ask for a photo.. Oh. and I am just getting out of an exhausting relationship. I really just need some kind men to talk to and exchange emails with. If there's something that comes out of it then let's do it! (not literally!) So let me tell some things about myself, I am mixed, I'll tell you more through email, I have curves, some may call me fat, but I'm working on being something better to the ""Washingtonians eyes"", with saying that you may ask yourself where is she from? The answer: California. I've been in this state for almost 10years I have a little big man age, I'll let you know if you've taken some interest in this email. I'm very easy on the eyes, and you won't be ever sorry for meeting me, because not matter what happens out of this you can say you have a friend in me.! "" Quoted from Toy Story!!"" Btw I am in my early 30s and live in seattle. I have a car and I'm very mobile, would you ever consider working out with me at the gym sometime??

I've been really lonely and I miss falling asleep with someone. It's hard to fall asleep on my own.

Be really nice to meet someone who wouldn't mind hanging out and maybe staying the night a couple nights per week.

I don't want to have sex and it needn't be anything more, just a cuddle/sleeping partner.

I enjoy watching movies, working out, baking, traveling the world, hiking, books, board games, good food, museums, the dog park and spending time with friends and family. I don't drink, don't do drugs. Generally a pretty happy and laid back person. I'm a pretty cool girl and I'm an awesome and loyal friend.

Let me know if you're interested. I guess if I had to give a type I am in taller clean cut white guys, but I'm not exclusive to that.

About me- I have one child and am a great mother. I love animals and being active. I am also very competitive and enjoy gaming. I am pretty straight forward and won't say I love you unless I do, but I love hard when I do.

age: 30

I'm not great at talking about myself so here are some facts about me and if I seem intriguing to you please say Hi. I should note I am looking for something serious so please be looking for the same. No FWB or NSA here. 

So here it goes:

I'm 30 and a Pisces 

Fulltime Mom to an awesome 5yr old spirited little girl.

I am a BBW or some say I'm just Curvy but I will say I'm comfortable with who I am.

I have blue eyes and black hair.

I stand at 5'8.5.

I 24 tattoos and 14 piercings which are just in my ears, nose and brow.

I love Batman along with The Wolverine and Rorschach, but in all honesty Batman is and ALWAYS will be my #1 and Michael Keaton was the best! But Christian Bale is in 2nd place.

I enjoy being a dork and can be random at times.

Horror movies are my absolute favorite but I also enjoy Scifi and Comedies but I honestly do not have a favorite movie.

I enjoy all different types of music. I will note that Bohemian Rhapsody is pretty much my favorite song and yes I will sing it loud and proud.

I'm pretty awesome and outgoing, I'm easily amused. I like rides in the car or walking on the ferry. I like bowling and pool. Holding hands and PDA.

Purple is my favorite color along with my favorite shade, Black and 7 is my favorite number.

I enjoy spending time with my tiny family and my also weird and out of the box wonderful friends who are also not afraid to be random and silly.

I smoke cigarettes but I don't smoke Mary Jane but if you are friendly with her it's all good in my book I just don't smoke it. I also don't really drink I can't stand the taste since having my daughter and I refuse to drink and drive.

I live in the Lynnwood area technically Edmonds I'm on the border. I would really prefer you live somewhere not tooo far from me.

Your picture gets mine.

If I haven't scared you off or lost your interest then don't be shy and say ""Hi!""

Being sick sucks. Being sick and having no one to cuddle with is even more of a bummer!
But really, I'm a 33yr old bbw/ssbbw looking for a long term relationship. Romance. Laughter. Fun and simply enjoying the small things in life.

About me:
As stated above, I'm 33 years old.
I'm white with brown hair and hazel eyes that change from blue to green to grey depending on mood/what I'm wearing.
I am a big woman that loves to cuddle and just enjoy the company of the person I'm with.
I don't do drugs and rarely drink. DDF as they say, I do believe.
I love laughter and life, going on pointless drives, animals and definitely enjoy smaller town/country living to the city but I can find happiness most anywhere.
Games, movies and music are things I enjoy. I also love art and books/writing.
I have no kids unless you count my parrot as my child and here in the near future I have every intention of getting a couple of sugar gliders (so cute!) and a tarantula. They fascinate the hell out of me.

About you:
All I'm looking for is someone around my age, maybe a few years scaled either way. Ethnicity is of no consequence though I do have a thing for Asian men. I like to think that laughter is the best medicine and an open mind can get one far in life.
So if you like to laugh, are open to a long term relationship and like big women, hit me up!

As a side note, I like to take things at a slower speed when getting to know someone. I'm seeking a connection and someone that I can date long term, if not for the rest of my life.
Your picture gets mine.
Please put your favorite animal in the subject line. :)
I look forward to hearing from ya!

I'm going to keep this short and sweet. I'm looking for something that turns into a relationship eventually. Ideally I'd love to find someone with a good sense of humor that's up for random weekend adventures as much as they are lazy weekends in. I don't know for sure what kind of person would be best there, but tell me about yourself and if we seem compatible we'll go from there.

I'm 31 on the bigger side, but working on that. Short, sarcastic, can laugh at almost anything. No kids, no drama, have a full time job, a car, etc.. I have no idea what you want to know, but I'm an open book so ask away.

I'd love to find a man that I can fall asleep on the couch waiting for to come home from work that wakes me up with kisses. I love scary movies (psychological scary) and all types of music ( favorite is country rock and classic rock) ... When it's nice out I am outdoors ( hiking camping at parks beaches lakes) when it's cold im cuddled on the couch watching movies.. I need a personal heater when it's cold .. I am always cold lol.. I'll be going back to school soon and start bartending again soon, only been here for about 2 weeks still waiting for my van to get here to get things started. I've always been independent, except when it comes to falling asleep alone lol... I am an introvert very quiet and will keep to myself I don't really like to go out and party I've really never been about that... Maybe the bat every now and then with certain people, but will eventually open up to the right people. I love to smile laugh and be happy... It won't be a good relationship if u can't goof off together. If you want to know more or see a pic then feel free to message me.

Where are all the great fantastic guys? The perfect man that appreciates a big woman to hold and kiss. Every girl needs love and affection. Looking to work towards commitment to the perfect lover hopefully age 40-56. A man that will take control during intimate moments. A man who isn't lost in the drama of his past. Smelling and tasting good are so very important....Intelligence, confidence and creativeness is a must.

Me ~
I'm loyal, dedicated, honest, loving, forgiving, a great Mom, my dog loves me. I'm in medicine, so I'm a people person. I'm compassionate, a great listener. If you ask me something , expect me to tell it to you like it is.
I'm the marrying type ( Or I was. Maybe again one day) I would prefer not to be the girlfriend forever or dating forever type. I was raised to be the girl that raised a family and loved her husband. I believe in family dinners. I cook every night for my kids, clean my own house, do my own laundry. And I have a career.
But I also need adult time. I have a great sense of humor, I'm a bit of a smart a**. But I can take as much teasing as I give. The outdoors are a huge love for me. Hiking, Biking, Camping Skiing, Wine Country. Travel! Weekend road trips are a favorite.

My kids live with me full-time year round, I have 2 of them.There is no drama with my ex husband.


Who I'm interested in :o)
So here it is. I'm done with playing games. I know this seems harsh and direct. I just am at a point in my life where I want to be with someone that can handle their affairs. GET YOUR CRAP TOGETHER!! If you have a simple divorce and a couple of kids , Great! But leave the DRAMA LlAMA out to pasture and be ready to start something NEW. It's time to move on and let it go! Life is to short to waste!
Please make sure your kids are ok with you dating and that you don't have to sneak around to do so, or worry that if you ever introduce them to someone that they will hate them right off the bat , due to past hurts!

I have two wonderful kids from a previous marriage. They are the most important things in the world to me. So is my family.
So, I want someone in my life that I can do great fun things with. Who loves kids, dogs, an occasional gummy fruit flying from the back seat. Who likes weekend road trips, hiking, wine tasting, music, fun dates, bbq's with friends. Fishing is a new adventure for me, and I love it as do my boys. I would even be open to learning how to hunt!
So let's start with some honesty, be great at communication, you must love kids, dogs, traveling. Laughter and humor. Life is way to short to be serious all the time. Sometimes things happen, and seriously, you just have to laugh it off. Have a career, a passion, something you love to do. Be emotionally and financially stable. I'm ok with someone having kids, but I cannot have anymore.

I'm also ok with someone in the military.(Army, Marines or Air Force, Navy) Just please be stationed on JBLM or in the state of Washington. I understand deployments, and all that come along with it. ( Several emails have asked me that )

Oh how to attract the attention of the right person...

Let me begin by sharing what I'm looking for. I am HWP, honest. I am looking for the same or close to it. Not only for physical attraction but if you're into being physical, we probably already have something in common. My main man is my awesome dog. If you have a female who is the center of your world, hopefully she too has four legs or is under the age of 18 and somehow related. Please no bored married men or men in LTRs. This isn't Utah after all. Speaking of which, I'm not big into organized religion and we would probably get along if you weren't either. I love the earth, mother nature rocks it! Kids are awesome, we are a package deal. Period. Smoking is unacceptable. As are drugs, how old are we now? I really couldn't care less what you do for a job, but having one is a good thing. Age is a number, really it is. I tend to like younger but I'm here so anything goes. 
Nice People only need to apply.

One additional point I'd like to make, I am NOT looking for a FWB only. If you are, please don't waste your time or mine.

Hi there~

I am a 28 year old single female, no children. Employed, stable, have a car and my own place. I don't smoke or do any drugs. Healthy and active. 5'4, brown hair, brown eyes, olive colored complexion, nice legs and in shape. Fun loving, confident and great personality.

Seeking alike in male counterpart. Must be mature and stable, gainfully employed and carry no baggage. Handsome or cute. Taller than me is okay. Prefer white or latin but open to other races.

New to this part of town and seeking a nice guy to go on dates with and enjoy the weekends. It is actually my birthday this weekend and I am hoping someone is willing to show me a good time. I don't have any family or friends in this area, and my co workers are not exactly that friendly-or have family they tend to. Which leaves me to myself. 

I am interested in a nice dinner, movie, show etc. Does not have to be super organized

Nice girl deserves a nice guy don't you think?

If you are interested in taking me out, please email me your picture and when you want to meet up and I will reply with the same.

That is the progression I seek, with full of anticipations in discovering all qualities/substances of one another. Such joyous moments that would be.

With notifications of texts and e-mails, feeling my heart beat and smiling at kind words or silly jokes sometimes, I would like to feel alive. Whenever we meet, gradually, I want our affection to be stronger and more expressive to confirm our feeling and acceptance. There no rush.

I am an attractive woman with bubbly and exciting personality. I am always seeking for something amusing and mentally stimulating. And I wish to have an interesting, modern, professional, engaging, very fit and sexy, confident friend. Hopefully he is physically young but mentally mature.

There are so much more to enjoy in life. Why waste.

So I'm a bit country, lil bit of a tomboy still, enjoys rural life vs. big cities, do not like traffic and crowds. Much more comfortable and jeans, Georgia boots, and a hoody, summer time flipflops and a tank or t-shirt. Enjoy fishing, camping, lakes rivers, the bay/beach, clamming, shrimping, day hikes. Enjoy cooking, working around the place, Have home on acreage(still owe on) not looking to live between two homes. Hard working. Love family, kids, and animals. Looking for long-term, loyal, trustworthy, affectionate private and public. I want that connection and romance when out in public, that people might have to tell us to get a room. Looking for someone and only someone who shares same interest of rural living, the outdoors, doesn't mind a woman who can get as dirty as them, and willing to work side by side, sharing a life together. Not looking for endless texting, emailing, phone conversation, but someone who is genuinely looking for their last love. I will share pictures only once, I believe we share the same interest and commonality ( not sure if that is a real word, LOL) and also that you send a picture. I don't think you will be disappointed. But please tell me as much as you can what interest we share. I stay very active 52 - 59 yr old if you are active. Please list our common interest and a picture please, if I don't respond it's simply because I don't feel we share the same interest, and intentions for a relationship, If you answer with one sentence obviously we won't communicate, which is very important to me. And prefer someone that works, I afraid someone retired or SSI might not be compatible because I work and work hard and not always able to take off and go. I'm sorry for this but I will only respond to those who shares their interest that they feel we have A LOT in common and why ALSO with a photo. AND LOCATION is important.

Companionship: "" the state of being with someone""; she missed his company...

I am a single/divorced, in my early 40's, tall and quite thin gal, looking to find someone to catch the occasional (or regular) movie with; likely to share a drink and/or a meal now and again too; maybe to explore the foods and other offerings of the farmers market (or other 'outing' adventure), or just walk one of the many trails around here to take in mother nature. 

IF we should make a 'connection' then we could explore that further, but I am in no hurry, nor do I have any designs to make my life or yours topsy-turvy. 

Below are some characteristics and traits I seek and appreciate in another: 

~The ability to communicate your feelings, emotions, and needs without wanting/having to be domineering.
~HWP and on the taller side as I am. 
~Since I do not smoke, I ask that you be a non-smoker as well.
~Between 35 -- 55 years old; no more and no less, please.

I hope to receive your introduction with some relevant details regarding you. :)

Hello All,

I am a SBF seeking as SWM for a Long Term Relationship. I am 5'5, light skinned, with a few extra pounds. I'm mostly attracted to taller, stocky build, bearded, outdoorsy type of men. Someone that has strong positive values, can communicate effectively, has a zest for life, and overall, a good natured individual . 

I'm a big kid at heart, but can be serious when I need to be. I'm not a workaholic, but prefer to stop and smell the roses often. I enjoy home life as much as I enjoy being out in nature. Please be somewhat active. If you consider yourself a couch potato, hmmmm, we would not be a great fit. 

I enjoy traveling , camping, hiking, whitewater rafting, music, the Arts and exploring this beautiful state we live in. I'm a non smoker and light drinker. If you're the same, that's a major plus. Generally, I'm a happy and blessed individual . I'm easy to get along with and prefer a drama/stress free life style as much as possible. I prefer to make love, not war. I never go to bed angry. I prefer to address issues, find a solution(agree to disagree too) and move on. I'm affectionate, sensual, loyal and monogamous.

If you like what you've read, please send a picture and a little about you!!!!

May I start by saying that while I don't necessarily need a cat lover to hang with, you should at least understand and/or respect cats for what they are. They are not dogs, and if you're not ok with that, move on. 

Basically I'm looking for someone who will make me laugh AND also stick around. Apparently that's a tall order. I've got faults like anyone else, but I'm pretty sure I'm not that difficult a person to live with, unless you've got serious commitment issues (I'm monogamous to the core) or you absolutely hate cats. Some may think of me as boring (I won't go downhill skiing with you, or paddleboard Puget Sound), but I like to think of myself as ""comfortable"". Roadtrips are more my speed, with coffee in hand of course. I also like less strenuous hikes. Change the subject line if you email me so I know you're a real person who has actually read my whole post. And please forgive me if I don't reply right away. Emails with pics get considered first.

PLEASE don't message me if you're under 45. Or married.

I am a single female in the early 40s, looking for someone who is open to having a ""traditional"" monogamous relationship where you take the time to get to know someone, go out on dates, hold hands, enjoy each other's company, laugh with each other, have good conversations, maybe even take short trips. I'm not necessarily looking for happily ever after or even marriage, but I do appreciate having a quality companion who can supplement my life and hopefully I can do the same for him.

A little about me: I am independent, smart and educated, funny, strong willed, articulate/outspoken. I like to stay healthy and exercise regularly. Hobbies include cooking, hanging out with friends, travel, read, arts. 

A little about the ""ideal"" man: Someone close in age rage (30s-40s) independent, smart and educated, funny also. Also likes to stay healthy and keeps in shape. Shared similar interests/hobbies is nice, but I think it can be beneficial to try new things as well. 

If there's anyone interested in getting to know me for a potential companion relationship, I look forward to hearing from you! Please introduce yourself and tell me a bit about what you're seeking on CL.

If you are looking for a funny, sarcastic and sassy woman, you found her!?

I love to laugh and and try not to take myself too seriously. I'm looking for a guy that is a great balance of serious and fun loving. Who likes to flirt and have fun but knows when to take things seriously. Are you up for some adventures and exploring the cool places that WA has to offer? There are just so many places I have yet to see and would love to have a partner to share the exploring with.

I'm a very attractiveand young looking larger woman. I'm the full BBW package with a great personality. Now, you may be thinking that I need to prove that statement and will be asking for a picture of me. I will send you one if I find you interesting. Which is the long way of telling you that you need to tell me about yourself AND send your face picture first.

Just to give you a little more more about me....college educated, long ago transplant, self employed, animal lover, volunteer, spiritual, non drinking, non smoking, witty, fairly sarcastic, lover of all things quirky.

As for what I'm looking for in a guy.... fun loving, stable job, active, lives locally, non married or attached (aka single), non smoker, funny, affectionate, close to my age or a little younger, animal lover, someone I find attractive. 

If I caught your interest send me an email tell me about yourself and start a conversation that hopefully we can continue in person.

One final note, since this is CL, I'm not looking for a hookup or fwb.

Like the tittle says, I'm looking for a strong and caring man. Someone who doesn't need mommy to hold their hand for simple things, and who also knows how to be a gentleman. Small things like opening doors and compliments go a long way. It's not a one way street either. You should be okay getting compliments and treated with respect. 

People have good and bad days. Sometimes it's nice to talk and let go or be there for someone and listen. 

I love having lazy days inside watching movies or going outdoors and having an adventure. Car drives, trips up the mountain, and sightseeing are great.

I do have a stable job, my own car and my own place. Please have the same, no parents basements or anything like that. 

I'm 5'8"" blue eyes and blonde hair. My body is pretty average, because hey, sometimes that cheeseburger on the way home isn't so bad, and that's okay. 

Please attach something about yourself and a picture if interested. 

I'd like to get to know you and see where things go.

I do realize this is a long shot ! I'm a Christian woman (not boring or bible freak). I realize you stop being ""cool"" once you give your life to Christ, and have unpopular/ mainstream ideologies about life, especially living in a big city like seattle .



I'm compelled and up for the challenge of meeting someone, not necessarily uber ""religious"", but definitely spiritual, with awareness of a higher/ supreme being. 



Essentially, I am in search of a person with whom I can share a deep spiritual connection with and everything else will follow. 



Before you go throwing stones, I am well aware of the fact that I am posting on Craig's list. You see, Jesus in his days on earth didn't only hangout with the ""righteous"", he hung out with Everyone. No one is perfect, as long as they seek first the kingdom of God! 



Quick Stats: I Just turned 36 (look younger), Single, never married and no children, but hope to have some in the future. I stand 5""4 ,128 lb brown eyes, short black hair, considered attractive. As you may have gathered, I'm NOT looking for a quick fling or immoral ventures. 



Not much into club scenes, but I drink wine lightly in lounge or restaurant where we can actually hear each other. I like live shows like Broadway. Church activities, I enjoy theaters, restaurants, shopping, museums, traveling etc. 



I live in seattle but i'm in the City quite often. I work very hard and anyone who knows me will notice that although far from perfect, I am a strong and driven individual. I hope one day in conjunction with my future partner, build a fulfilling life. 



See, a lot of people are very lonely, we are all human but turn to others people, drugs, food, addiction, or alcohol ecetera. These are all temporary fixes. Happy to confirm that I am neither lonely nor need someone to ""make me happy"" or ""complete me"", that's what my relationship with God is for. 



It took a while, however I have learnt that no one could ever make you happy unless you really get to know yourself and find true internal happiness. Not even material things could come close to accomplishing this task. 



I know I've written a lot, especially for a ""personal ad"" on Craig's List and due to the non conventional nature of this content, I at least do not expect an overflow/ influx of meritless responses, and that's perfectly fine by me. 



Anyway, hopefully this post has touched at least one person's heart. Please, ONLY respond if you somewhat agree with the above, if you are a single Male aged 30-42, attractive (pictures a MUST), driven, looking to strengthen your spirituality, and are looking for something substantial in a potential partner. 



Oh! Remember, It's ok not to be ""cool"", wishing you Abundant Blessings! :)

Hi...gonna apologize in advance cause it's a bit of a long read....
First off I am posting in the dating/romance section, not casual encounters....not looking for a wham-bam thank you mam kind of thing. Not looking for instant gratification, or to hook up with the first guy to show interest, either (sorry, if that sounds rude/cold)....someone that will maintain interest...lol I know that sounds funny, like I am as fun as a sack of potatoes...lol I want someone real, something with meaning.
I am forty two, 190 and 5'2""...a big gal, and I don't mean I am tall...lol 
I AM SINGLE, YOU SHOULD BE TOO!!!!
I prefer white males, not looking for a gal or couple!!!!
I have a few guidelines...
I am not going to MEET you at your place or a hotel room!!! I am looking for dating/romance that means dating not meeting...lol
We're not having sex on our first date...no matter how much of a prince charming you are...lol
NO GLOVE, NO LOVE!!!
NO ANAL!!!!
I am not looking for long distance, want something that involves us seeing each other once or twice a week not once every two weeks....so change the subject to where you live (not your exact address...lol) Oh, and I'll just think you're a bot or didn't read my post and won't read your note to me...if you don't.
I probably should have started with this but I have HSV1.
Please, no haters telling me what a nasty fat slut I am...it makes me sad for you, how much anger and hate you must have to go out of your way and try and hurt someone you don't know. Besides, I might be fat but I am not a nasty slut...lol
Oh, and I have a life, you should too. That means I am not sitting around emailing all day...got work/chores...have to shower...do daily tasks...you know what I mean... lol

Let me tell it to you straight, no bullshit.

I am fat, but I'm pretty fucking awesome. I know for a lot of you the words ""fat"" and ""awesome"" don't go together and you guys can just stop reading now.

Yes I'm fat but I'm also pretty. And independent. And geeky. And pretty damn intelligent. I'm also a deep person who has very little interest in small talk and wants to delve into the kind of conversations that reveal the hidden facets of your personality and your desires. 

Despite the intensity, I'm constantly throwing about amusing banter since I feel completely rewarded when I make other people laugh. I also tend to talk about sex more than I should which can be a blessing and a curse. 

I'm looking for a guy who can accept all this and hopefully has many of the same characteristics. You should write to me if all of the following describe you:

-You are 33-49
-You are single and monogamous. For me that means your heart and your cock are not being given to someone else.
-You are ready for a capital R Relationship.
-You are articulate and you can actively participate in an email conversation before we meet.
-You are interested in meeting. Like, in person. For reals.
-You see truth in the following statement: R2-D2 is the real hero of the original Star Wars saga.

Write to me with the name of a favorite movie in the subject line and some questions you have for me. No questions get no response.

I am a SWF. 26 years old. No children. BBW; so if you are looking for a stick then you are reading the wrong ad. I am loyal and honest. Friendly and outgoing. Bubbly. College student. I am very 420 friendly. Family oriented and I'd do anything for a friend. I live on my own. I own my own car. My favorite color is blue, my favorite dish is lasagna, I love the smell of rain and I could play in it for hours, I love the smell of fresh cut grass so I really don't mind getting down and dirty when it's needed. I am not a girly girl. I like to wrestle around and enjoy my time wherever I am. I enjoy things like bon fires, BBQ's, being outside, going to the rodeo drive-in, music, movies, spending time together, and a lot of other things but let's save that so you have something to ask :) 

****you must be located in the kitsap area preferably Bremerton or Port Orchard****

I am looking for a man between the ages of 20 and 34. SINGLE. Employed. I don't mind if you have children as long as you want more ;) Pretty much have your life together and headed in a positive direction. 420 friendly. Enjoys being together. Looking for something serious. Gentle and passionate. Honest, trustworthy, and kind. Respectful. Must love dogs. Real man meaning I don't play games. Plain and simple. 

It is important to understand that no one is perfect and we shouldn't strive to change one another. Instead you learn to love the flaws. I want to be with someone who brings the best out in me and vice-versa. I want a long term serious relationship. I am talking eventually building a family. I don't want a fling, I don't want to sext, I don't want to be friends with benefits or f-buddies. I want something real. I need a real man ready for the real deal. I'm ready to start my own family and I'm sick of waiting while everyone else is getting pregnant and beginning their families.

Hey there, fellas!

I am in pursuit of a kind, fun, happy, intelligent, goofy guy pal with whom I might share some of life's amazing adventures!

A bit about me...I am a single mama. My munchkin is the most important person in my life. I am an outdoor enthusiast! I enjoy hiking, camping, and splashing in rivers! I like exploring new places and seeing all of nature's splendid beauty! I also love yoga, learning, reading, smiling, baking, playing around, and being silly! I'm quite responsible when it comes down to it, but I'm a firm believer that one simply must have fun and enjoy life!

I'd like to meet a cool guy to get to know, become friends with, and to have adventures with from time to time. Huge bonus if there's a single dad out there who would be up for park play dates down the road. I'm primarily just looking to make a good friend. I'm not exactly looking to jump into anything serious. And I am absolutely not interested in a casual fling.

Hello :)
So a little bit about me and what I'm looking for 

I'm 24. I'm intelligent, stubborn, hard working, dedicated, gym freak, loving, single mom
( meaning no dad in the picture, it's my child and I all day, every day)
Don't like kids?
Don't want to date someone who has a kid?
Don't understand that my kid comes first? 
Please move on.
Don't waste yours or my time.
I'm witty, a complete smart ass, I'm independent and bold.
I have a full time job, I'm perfectly fine financially. Don't need a sugar daddy. Thanks though. 

I would love to meet someone as obsessed about fitness as myself. 
I am not super tiny and fit, I have thick muscular thighs and a little extra meat from being out of the gym due to a torn muscle, an amazing ass ( get compliments on it regularly )
Lol!
But I am very serious about getting myself back in gear.
I want someone who loves the gym and would support me and my workout ethic and dedication, as I would theirs 
Plus seeing a hot guy workout is the sexiest thing ever to me, especially if I know he's coming home with me 
I want someone who can keep a conversation going. Who has a car, job and hopefully a place of their own. ( as I do )
Someone who is fun and adventurous.
Tattoos are a plus ;)

I'm missing some spark in my life, I've been single for so long with raising my kiddo alone. Want to start making time for someone in my life.
Doesn't have to be super serious.
But something for me, to feel like myself again. 

READ: please respond with your favorite color in the subject line. 
Please include a pic as well
will respond with mine 

You can't put a color in the subject line and attach a picture then don't expect a response. I assume your a bot or not smart enough to follow instructions.

Hello, My name is Amanda and after a couple years of being single I decided to give a possible relationship or maybe even love another go. I am a chubby girl, but to be honest I love working out and its something that I have been working on, but I do love me for who I am and if you dont like a chubby girl then I am probably not the best bet for you. Also I do not sleep on the first date, I am one to get to know you and be in a relationship before anything. I love when someone is funny, and I like someone who is more of a gentlemen then anything else. I am 28 Years old, and age normally doesn't matter to me, but if you cant be mature, then I am probably not the best bet for you. I work, and yes I am still in school. Dark hair brown eyes. If you ever want to hang out let me know, and we will do something fun! I like to pretty much do anything really I am super easy going. I even like to just stay in and watch movies rather then actually go out, I am also one amazing cook so if you ever want me to cook for you I can do that as well.

I am a SBF seeking as SWM for a Long Term Relationship. I am 5'5, light skinned, with a few extra pounds. I'm mostly attracted to taller, stocky build, bearded, outdoorsy type of men. Someone that has strong positive values, can communicate effectively, has a zest for life, and overall, a good natured individual . 

I'm a big kid at heart, but can be serious when I need to be. I'm not a workaholic, but prefer to stop and smell the roses often. I enjoy home life as much as I enjoy being out in nature. Please be somewhat active. If you consider yourself a couch potato, hmmmm, we would not be a great fit. 

I enjoy traveling , camping, hiking, whitewater rafting, music, the Arts and exploring this beautiful state we live in. I'm a non smoker and light drinker. If you're the same, that's a major plus. Generally, I'm a happy and blessed individual . I'm easy to get along with and prefer a drama/stress free life style as much as possible. I prefer to make love, not war. I never go to bed angry. I prefer to address issues, find a solution(agree to disagree too) and move on. I'm affectionate, sensual, loyal and monogamous.

I'm not looking for something causal or a hookup tonight--I'm looking to meet someone interested and open to dating (but we get to take time to determine if it's a good fit with us).

I am smart, kind, funny, artistic, ambitious, witty, direct, assertive and generous (please re-read ""direct"" and ""assertive,"" traits that do not mesh with everyone). I'm 5'6"", average build, dark-haired and pretty.

I like music and trees and water and food and bourbon and movies and epic adventures. Any overlap with you?

Generally, I'm a happy and blessed individual . I'm easy to get along with and prefer a drama/stress free life style as much as possible. I prefer to make love, not war. I never go to bed angry. I prefer to address issues, find a solution(agree to disagree too) and move on. I'm affectionate, sensual, loyal and monogamous.

Hi there!

It is so hard these days to find a good match. To find someone who will be honest, loyal and a good person. Too many people play games and can seem very heartless at times. I don't understand why people have to cheat and lie. If you don't want to be in a committed serious relationship than don't be in one. You can find plenty of people these days that want to do the casual thing. 

If you are looking for a serious relationship and want a good strong woman than please keep reading.

I am a 38 year old single female in Seattle that is looking for long term. I want to start out with a friendship (not fwb) and build from there.I am laid back and have a great sense of humor. I am honest, loyal, caring, hardworking and I treat people well. I enjoy a variety of activities including but not limited to fishing, camping, traveling, cooking, gardening, reading, bowling and spending good times with great people. 

I believe the key to a long lasting realtionship is communication, compromise, loyality and honesty. There also must be laughter. If you aren't laughing in life than you aren't living it. 

People say I have an old soul and that may be partly true. I am a little old school at times. I have morals but i am not uptight or a prude. I can be very playful and silly. 

I am a swf, 5'5 and 230lbs. I have long reddish brown hair and brown eyes.

I am a mother of one so single fathers would be great or a man who understands what it means to be a parent. I want a man who doesn't put on a front. A man who can just be himself. Someone who has morals and treats people well. A man who is laid back but also has the energy to have fun. Someone who will dance just to have fun whether he can dance well or not. Someone who can have a conversation and laugh together. A man who like outdoors activities and who can also be cool with just relaxing at home. Someone who is open to try new things and explore the world. Someone who has family values and is honest. If you like fishing that is a huge plus. I want someone who can be playful at times in all ways. Someone who can handle a woman who can be sarcastic and a bit of a smart ass when she is being playful. Someone who actually wants to fall in love and build a life with the right person. 

Email me if you would like to know more. 

Please put your favorite Song in the title so i know you're real. Your pic gets mine :)

Thank you for looking

Me too. 

If you are an extroverted introvert who has learned to be sociable, chatty and conversational, welcome to my party! I am an east coast transplant who arrived here in the mid 80's - went native, left behind all my worldly possessions and acquired new stuff along the way.

My world is populated with friends who appreciate me for my sense of humor, tireless state of mind, attentive and conventional alliance with the absurd and the serious. 

I am a mildly adventurous ordinary woman and an above average communicator if not clueless about the topic who enjoys mundane activities - movies at home, the performing arts, walking, dancing, home cooked cuisine, eating, smooching, and visions of the natural world that don't require mountain climbing or a 7 mile hike.

If you are looking for an off-line adventure, look forward to an RSVP that will turn my head with a nod in your direction

Sometimes we stay in. .

We have s** maybe even breakfast

We enjoy our time together 

And we respect one another's schedules 
And life styles

This is a proposal for a partime relationship
With long term potential

And to be clear this is not a hook up or casual encounter

Here's who I'm looking for to be my new friend

Well I finally made it home after a day of helping many ""friends"", which honestly I don't mind but not one wished me a ""happy birthday"". Other friends who realized it was my day invited me out to what was more convenient for them....don't get me wrong it is thoughtful but not what I wanted. I spent the day planning two weddings, one baby shower, one bachlorette party, recovering a missing dog, bringing cigarettes to a drunk neighbor, an argument with a GF's boyfriend, advice to my daughter, planning breakfast with friends when I really want lunch, fixing a friends car and finally I make it home only to realize I forgot to buy ice for myself so I can have a drink to celebrate my day alone.

I realize at this point being it CL I will have at least 30 men request a BJ to celebrate, 12 who will request phone sex, 8 will think if I send a nude I will be sooo much happier, 10 who will meet if I buy the drinks, 10 who will be nasty and call me fat, 10 are here just on ""business"" and will add to their expense account, another 11 who will be under 30 who are ""in"" to older woman, 4 will state they want to just please but are liars, 5 who need a place to stay, 5 who prefer men but will settle, 3 that are just bored, 2 who can't drive and one who may be nice enough to offer an ice cube under certain conditions. With that being said I look like a pedthedic human human who is now drinking a warm beverage hoping one man might be nice enough to send a thoughtful message though it serves no purpose because I don't feel I could actually invite someone to my space with an ice cube. I know he would never invite me to his because his girlfriend might find out All in all it is perhaps a waste of time but I do appreciate the 2 minutes of venting before I get flagged..

Cheers!!

Hello everyone!

I am a very busy divorced (of five years) mother (three children) who has a full-time professional career and is working on a masters degree in pursuit of a PhD. I am currently traveling around much for work and school and I am finding myself between the areas of Grays Harbour, Thurston and Lewis counties. Though in a few months it will all slow down and settle into one area. 

I have managed to squeeze in gym visits early mornings (5am), walks during lunch and audio lectures on drives, weekends devoted to my kids, but even in the chaos and busy-ness, I am lacking companionship; and truly I have no idea how to even start dating or move pass a first date. I have tried POF and OKCupid and random smart phone apps that connect me to people and it fizzles in five minutes. 

I am new to Washington state, but not my career, yet I am finding myself having to work harder here to put a smile on someone's face. The locals here are a tough crowd. The weather is even tougher for me, as I long for summertime heat and sundresses. 

I am hoping to find someone who is wanting companionship, who enjoys intellectual conversations as much as the mundane; Kid-friendly, good work ethics, spiritually-healthy and a believer in God. A man who is not bitter, closed-off, pining over an ex, or angry towards women--Maybe enjoys the countryside more than the city, appreciates art and expression, passionate and invested in himself and not afraid to get dirty.

Hi there,

I am new to dating. In fact, it's more of a rite of passage. I was in a strict religion in which I have gotten out and been given the blessing to go out and date.
About me: Young, college educated, attractive, innocent, drug free, don't drink, intelligent, interested in many things.

Looking for a mature, stable and intelligent guy who is going to take his time getting to know me and develop a relationship before we get into anything intimate.
Looking for genuine courtship and interest in myself.

I feel as though I am worth it as I am a virgin and have a lot to give to the right guy.

If you are interested to meet me and go on a real date with no real pressures to get intimate, please give me information on yourself, picture and why you would be a good fit for me and understand my situation.

No picture=no response.

I would like us to talk and text and then agree to meet in public place for a real date. I am free this weekend.

I am looking for a relationship-lite: someone to go out for dinner, walks, movies, date-like things. If we have chemistry, there's physical companionship as well! I'm not initially looking for a serious commitment, but if our relationship develops naturally in that direction, we can determine what we want. 

I am a very independent female who's not into drama, BS, flakes, liars. I have good instincts and I read people really well, so if you choose to contact me, you should keep it real to save us all time. Physically, I am petite but HWP, exercise regularly so would like to say I'm in decent shape for a person in her 40s. Personality wise, I am smart, professional, funny, loyal, honest, a good friend. 

Just an FYI, for those of you are interested in developing a physical relationship out of this, I need my head to be stimulated just like you need your other head stimulated. Just sexting or dirty talk with me ain't gonna do the trick. For those who don't have the patience or attention span to put in the work, no worries, there are plenty of simpler females out there.

If interested, please introduce yourself along with a pic! If you want to make sure I'm real first before sending a pic, please ask.

Perhaps this isn't the right place to post this, but I am in a real bind. Long story short, I find myself stuck in a borderline abusive relationship. He convinced me to quit my job, which I thought was sweet at the time but now realize that it was a method of manipulation, just to make me dependent on him. I hate that it worked. 

I need to get out as soon as I can. I do have friends with couches and could certainly find a place to crash temporarily, but I'd rather not freeload. I am an excellent cook (and I love to do it), very tidy, and I have years of administrative experience. I'm wondering if any of these skills/qualities might be helpful to a kind hearted man with an extra room in Seattle. I need to figure out a way to feed myself and to store my furniture and household items, but that is a secondary concern. I will begin looking for work immediately, so this will likely be a temporary situation unless we really like living together and decide to continue on. I do have two cats, and we are a package deal. I know that could be a dealbreaker for some.

I don't want to include any personal details here for obvious reasons, but if you think we could work something out, let's talk! 

How can I help you?

So far all the fellows I've met weren't quite serious about dancing.
Before you respond, keep in mind the only type of physical I'm going to get with you is on the dance floor. 

Anyways, I struggle with depression and there's nothing more that I love than spinning around on the dance floor with great company. If we mesh well, I'm up for dating in the future.
I'm ready for a relationship and I'm tired of being treated like an option. 

I'd like to meet twice a month. This would be on a Tuesday, Friday, or Saturday evening, depending on the location. The location would be either downtown Olympia or Tacoma. 

I'm attracted to blue collar/countryish type 
For dancing purposes, I'm 5'10 and need a partner 5'10 or over. 
Personal preferences, I'd like you to be smoke free, beard free or well groomed facial hair, 5'10 or over stalky build, and ages 30 through 39, a handsome little devil with a great sense of humor.

Seeking to meet one man who is interested in and fully available to establish a bona~fide LTR. We both hold an intent to create a wonderous life of growth and adventure together!

On CL of all places?! Yes!! you never know who might be reading the personals:)

I am looking forward to having just one special man who will read this and resonate ! i do not 'need' a relationship; however i find that a primary relationship is a catalyst for growth. learning, and expansion. 

I am not idealized, overly romantic, nor seeking someone to 'complete' me. I am simply clear regarding the kind of person with whom I could deeply connect with and commit to. There is no reason to compromise one's standards. Why create unnecessary suffering through diminishing or devaluing one's needs ? Relationships are challenging enough! I miss companionship, shared experience, various forms of intimacy, and depth discussion.

I lead with a strong spiritual and psychological orientation to life. I offer an open heart, easy access to a full range of emotions, depth awareness of others; I am thoughtful, kind, sensitive, and a caring facilitator of interior growth (mine and yours). I have a service-to-others orientation; i find joy and ease in acknowledging others and seek to elicit a heart-warmed smile. 

I am deeply inquisitive and a adept listener. I seek to know another and be known. 

I am both a student and teacher of the constructs found within A Course in Miracles.

I am a highly educated woman with a successful career. My children are young adults and contributing world citizens. I have been liberated from the myriad tasks involved in effectively running a household, taking care of a large home, and daily active parenting. 

I am considered attractive, am tall and slim (5'8 / 125 lbs), with a nice smile and a feminine presentation. I take good care of myself and expect that you do the same. Self-care is equated with self-love. i have no addictions or mental disorders!

The man I desire shall have done plenty of his own work toward self awareness/actualization, continually seeking to become his highest Self. You have a strong spiritual orientation and apply this in your daily way-of-being. You are successful in your chosen career, have strong relationships with family/friends, and possess a kind, attentive demeanor. You are over 48 years old, so that we are in the same development mental framework. You reside within the greater Seattle area.

I appreciate responses that would introduce yourself in some detail, related to the qualities I offer and those I seek. The value of internet connectivity is that it allows for an initial level discernment. A two sentence response doesn't support discernment or becoming known.

I am definitely ""for real"", honest in my self description and clear regarding the type of man i would be a great partner to.

Not a fit with those seeking fwb, polyamory, extramarital affairs, atheists, or long distance relationships (over 50 mi).

I was wondering if you would like to start a conversation. You seem like a perfect gentleman, I would really like to get to know more about you.
I have gotten so tired of settling for this and for that and then ending up miserable and hurt in a relationship. I am not looking for a purely sexual relationship. I think my ideal man, (this is what I would like to find even though I am not sure I ever will), but he would be romantic, kind, caring, affectionate, spontaneous, adventurous, faithful, make me laugh, honest, fun, loving, sweet and intelligent.
So in light of my ""ideal"" man idea I am looking to settle down, have something serious and real. I believe in little things such as I am not concerned so much about having my socks knocked off and being swept off my feet as I am in about finding the right fit with someone. I want someone who can look at me each and every morning and just be thankful we are together, I want someone who will glow when they smile. I want to be the old couple in the park that still holds hands and is in love for eternity.
I believe if as a person I strive to better myself the relationship will better itself.
Ok I am rambling and you probably think I am silly, so enough about that. If you are interested I would love to talk more so get back to me ....Thanks I will be looking forward in hearing back from you. 

Me: mid-50's, 5'6, long auburn hair, blue eyes
You: 40-55, taller than me, employed, single, great sense of humor....

Not really sure what I'll get out of this but I'll give it a try. I don't even know what to say but I guess I'll start with what I'm kinda looking for. I wanna get to know someone via the phone...calls/text and dates once we are bother comfortable. I'm not in a rush so if you are don't waste your time. I'm kinda into older guys I'm going on 25 so older than that is a plus. I want someone who has something going for themselves or on their way to building something. I like ppl with a story to tell (thug,hood,come from the struggle) but a past is a past I don't need it to be the current situation. That's not a big deal if that's not you...I'm still open to conversation. I like to text more than talk but I will talk. 

About me I work a lot right now but may change hopefully you do too but we can make time for each other. I'm a young black female getting my life together. I'm still living and learning so I'm not perfect of course. I'm thick...I'm shy at first, easy going. I just want someone who's not gonna pretend to be someone they ain't. Like I just wanna have the choice to be a part of what ever it my be...so if your married thats fine or in a relationship that's fine just be open with me. 

Maybe I've said enough let's see where this goes. Send a pic if your comfortable. Fivezero9 fivenine3 one8one5

So...the first pair of parentheses apply to my physical size. I am a large girl. We all have needs, and if I don't meet yours, well...we got that out of the way. 

(The sound of thousands of men hitting the back arrow on their browser.)

The second set of parentheses is more nuanced. In some ways I am decidedly not lost. Good education. Good job. Good friends. Nice apartment in a nice neighborhood. A growing 401K account. All the signs of togetherness.

But in other ways I am quite lost. Unsure of myself. Wanting to be controlled. Wanting to let go. Wanting to feel that there is someone...with good judgment who I can...relax around. Surrender to. 

Finding this kind of a connection, and establishing the needed trust is a bitch of a task, but....once found and established, god, is it fun. 

Looking for fun. Looking for fun, and joy, and the freedom of letting go.

Hello!
I guess this is the last place I should look for a relationship... but, here I am. I'm not one to go to bars and be out and about on the weekends, making it more difficult to meet people. 

I want to find someone who wants to hang out and do things this summer. Go on hikes, camping, road trips, stay in and watch movies, cook dinner, etc. 

A little about me.
I am 24, I am 5'6, dark brown hair, blue eyes. I am big/curvy. I live in Kent currently.. I have lived in a bunch of different places throughout my life. The most exciting thing I have done recently is pick up my things and move to Texas. I was there just shy of a year, it was the best time of my life. I was able to spend everyday with my nieces and nephews and explore a different part of the country. I graduated from Central Washington with a degree in Law and Justice, but I have yet to do anything with it. I love to be outside and active, but also I love to be indoors and relaxing. I do live at home with my parents, not the ideal situation, but I emptied out my bank account when I moved back from Texas. 

As for you, I prefer someone who isn't more than 10 years older than me. Other than that I don't think I am too picky, I prefer to get to know someone and their personality rather than just looks. 

Sorry for the novel, hopefully if you made it this far and are interested you will send me an email.
Also, I do have pictures, but I prefer to not post them on here, if you would like one, simply send me one in your message and I will respond with one.

It starts with the perfect man! 
Comfortable in his own skin because of where he's been!
We discover eachother in the most unexpected place...
From across the parking lot or inside a store,
I discoved your handsome face! ;) ~ wishing for more... 
I think to myself, "" I wonder if he is single?
It sure would be nice to introduce myself and mingel"" 
As our paths cross, we catch eachothers eye. 
We give a head nod as we smile to say hi!:)
Later that night as We're each home all alone we cross eachothers minds... 
If only we had stoped and taken the time! 
Now here I am, stuck dating on line! 
My-oh-my! I must have lost my mind! ... Perhaps I'm better off wish for snow!!!!
Don't ask me!.... What do I know! ;)~

People are not meant to live life alone, we are pack people by nature and we are meant to share our human experience with a special someone. I am excited to find my special someone very soon!
I like day hikes, (and used to do it daily) and walking every day with my dog. I enjoy going out to eat and movies but even more so, staying home cooking and watching a movie while we can cuddle and spoon & enjoy eachothers company, no matter what we do. I love the Mariners as well as the Hawks. :)
PS~ I am looking for a man who knows chivalry is alive and well!
Hint-hint... Wink-wink ;) Meaning IF you are genuinely interested in me, you will take the initiative to actually send me a nice note.
Good luck, don't forget to have fun.... & smile... You never know who might be watching ; )

The more I think about life the more I realize I am ready to settle down and start building something. 

I have my life together. I am going to school, I love my job, I love where I live, I have amazing friends, and a loyal puppy... But there seems to be something missing from my life. 

I miss having dinner ready when my bf gets home. Snuggling up against someone and having his arms wrapped around me. I miss the passion. The foreplay. The tension. The crazy in love feeling.

A little about myself. I am 25, Asian, full time student at UW, work full time, love the outdoors, hiking, cooking, trying new things, road trips, etc. I am more of a jeans and t-shirt type of girl that a nails and make-up type, not to say that I can't do nails and make up on special occasions. I am compassionate, caring, loyal, trusting, and have a big heart that has gotten me in more trouble that I can count. I am terrified of snakes, I can touch my toes, I love carbs, I can drive a stick, I am a dog person. What else would you like to know? 

If you think we would get along feel free to email me and tell me something about yourself. The more effort you put into your response the higher the likelihood I will respond to you. All one liners, emails asking for a pic, and men with bad grammar will be deleted. 

To prove I am real... We had a crazy wind storm rip through here earlier this week.

I am looking for a submissive daddy. I have always been a dominant person. Personally and professionally so it makes sense that my dominant personality carried into all aspects of my life.

I always fall, and can't always get up by myself but I get out there and try. 90% of the time Im just trying to stand up... Haha I love watching local bands play. Doesn't really matter the genre. I like supporting the local talent. For the most part I have a good head on my shoulders. I am busy with life well because we all have one. 

Things I don't like are rude and cocky people. I speak my mind but am rarely mean about it. 

I want someone to do things with and have an organic type of chemistry. Not just because you're a hot country man lol. 

Anyway hope no one flags this... It's not like I'm selling sex or something. Just because I don't reply don't go taking my ad off please :) Dear craigslist gods let a sane, smart, funny and handsome man say ""Hi"".

Last spring I posted here with that title, and I was flooded with responses. There were many men whom I wanted to contact, but by the time I got around to them, the post had expired and your links were gone. Here goes again: 
Me: 62, highly educated, musical, left leaning, relatively outdoorsy. Overweight, but working hard to change that. (I bet I can beat you at half the machines at the gym, and I hike and would love to learn to tango.) 
You: Minimum age 55. I don't care if you're educated, have money etc., because this has nothing to do with who you are, but a sense of humor is a must. As for baggage, we all have some, but please be looking it in the eye. No smokers or drinkers, please (perhaps a few a week. . . no more.. for me, it's a few a month) and if you've indulged in anything illicit since your college years, don't bother answering. If you reply that you're discreet, that your tongue works for hours, that you've always wanted to please an older woman, or if you live outside of the Hudson Valley . . . well, don't expect a response.
The boudoir is off limits unless we fall in love, but if that happens, I hope you have good blood flow ;-)

Soy una colombiana de 27 años de edad, me considero una persona humilde pero abierta a la vida es por eso que vivo el día a día superándome como persona en mi estudio de gastronomía y en el trabajo, así puedo ayudar a mi familia, Vivo con mi madre y mi hermano menor, no somos adinerados pero nuestra felicidad es la unión en familia, no tengo una relación actual porque quiero salir del país, quiero conocer un hombre que quiera formar una relación, pensando en el futuro, en tener una familia, en crecer como personas y como humano, un hombre maduro que sea consciente de que puede ayudar a una mujer. Actualmente mi trabajo es de modelo webcam, no es el mejor visto por la sociedad pero es algo que valoro mucho pues me permite estudiar, ayudar a mi familia. El trabajo es algo difícil pero pues a veces gano lo necesario para pagar los gastos del mes. Quiero vivir la vida intensamente, disfrutando de una noche llena de estrellas, un lindo atardecer y pues quiero contagiar a mi pareja con ver la vida de una forma hermosa y simple. Me gusta escuchar y que me escuchen. Espero pueda cautivarte y pues que me agregues a mi skype para entablar una conversación. Espero seas consciente que soy una mujer madura que quieres salir adelante y que en el momento no tengo las mejores condiciones para pagar un viaje pero que quiere abrir su corazón y dar mucho amor. skype tefa.mez ... te espero

Generally, I'm a happy and blessed individual . I'm easy to get along with and prefer a drama/stress free life style as much as possible. I prefer to make love, not war. I never go to bed angry.

A personal ad for me to find someone
Be sure to read this poem til it's done

I am an attractive BBW with auburn hair
seeking intellectual dinner conversation to share

For me, the sexiest organ is the brain
A sense of humor can also reign

You must not chew snoose, e-vape, or smoke
I am fine with it if you occasionally toke

For me 35 to 50 is a nice age range,
it's ok to be weird, but not too strange

Must love animals, since I have four
Kids are OK, mine are all out the door

I prefer American born and bred
Skin color not important purple, green or red ;-)

Must be single, no strings attached
Not seeking an AFF or FWB type of match!

I request NO pictures, and send none out
It's you I want to know about

Trump supporters and vegans are NOT for me
I am a carnivore that loves a man with nice teeth! 

If you send a response that I find lacks
Don't expect an answer back

I love intellect, wit and a great smile
To get my response use all of your wiles

Please be financially stable, and have a car
Let's start with a drink at the lounge or juice bar

Honest to a fault here.

I'm 26 5'9, long brown hair, bbw but hey if your a boob man I'm your gal 😉. I love bake, Bon fires, long drives, movies, farmers markets, and family oriented. I'm shy at first but get over it pretty fast. I don't smoke of any kind and drink occasionally.

I'm ready to find someone to settle down with. I'm sick of the games. I don't want a random hook up or fwb.

I know I'm not everyone's type and that's fine but what I'm looking for is a clean cut, honest, fun, taller than myself like 6'1 up, doesn't live to far and between 26-33.

Hi,, there gentlemen, (and I do mean gentlemen.) how's it going? You will need to ask for a photo.. Oh. and I am just getting out of an exhausting relationship. I really just need some kind men to talk to and exchange emails with. If there's something that comes out of it then let's do it! (not literally!) So let me tell some things about myself, I am mixed, I'll tell you more through email, I have curves, some may call me fat, but I'm working on being something better to the ""Washingtonians eyes"", with saying that you may ask yourself where is she from? The answer: California. I've been in this state for almost 10years I have a little big man age, I'll let you know if you've taken some interest in this email. I'm very easy on the eyes, and you won't be ever sorry for meeting me, because not matter what happens out of this you can say you have a friend in me.! "" Quoted from Toy Story!!"" Btw I am in my early 30s and live in seattle. I have a car and I'm very mobile, would you ever consider working out with me at the gym sometime?? If this has somewhat peeked your interest, feel free to shoot me an email.



P.S. Don't block me because I shop at Lane Bryant and not Forever 21???

So I gave up dating for Lent. Lent is over on Thursday. So let's go on a date on Friday or Saturday! 😊 

I work full time, have a vehicle, live alone, no kids, 1 dog, workout 3-5 times a week, and attractive. 

I know most the ladies who post on here are either ginormous or have a million kids. I'm not that. The only reason I'm on here is because I don't have single lady friends to go man hunting with and I'm not wasting $50/MO on dating sites! That cuts into my dating budget! Silly... Anywhoo, I've been asked out by 3 different guys at work this week. But don't shit where you eat right? Or something like that lol 

Anyway... Your photo gets mine. Let's exchange a few messages before we swap pictures though. K? 

I'm not bilingual, so please speak English... Looking for someone between the ages of 27 and 35.

My ex husband was abusive and left me alone with two small children. I don't need a savior but I do want a serious relationship so all my cards are on the table. I do work full time and balance a busy schedule but in my spare time I enjoy the outdoors a lot. I love hiking, camping, floating down the river, fishing all that fun stuff. I also have a nerdy side and love learning (accounting/programming all kinds of things) as well as playing old school video games. Of course I also love shopping, movies and long walks on the beach ;)

I am looking for a relationship, not a hookup. Mature white
woman, very artistic and creative. I love attending SIFFindie 
films and walking several miles a day.
Adore kayaking!

I have a masters degree in a social science and am going back to 
school. Hopefully at the Seattle Film Institute. I love going out, cooking in, 
talking about the paranormal and near death experiences. Had one of
those 2.5 years ago and barely made it out alive. Now it is time to
celebrate. 

Love deep conversations, and hate email after 18 long years
in high tech. I lean left but don't involve
myself politically - there are lots of cultures out there and
I love seeing new ones. No kids but I did help raise a lovely
girl years ago. I love wicked humor and creative types.
My goal now is to travel, both locally and otherwise, then
return for school in. I love school and have a BA in Design, 
Masters in a social science and three certifications from the UW.
Now it is time for something artistic again!!

I love good Sci-Fi and even crappy Sci-Fi. My parents are gone so it is 
just me. I am looking for an educated self sufficient man, ages 40 and
up. Enjoy acupuncture as often as I can afford and in decent health. I
have now lost two friends who I grew up with to
cancer so want to grab life and enjoy it! No debt, excellent credit
and take care of my own finances.

What I won't do is talk about sex, body types or parts with a stranger. 
Have had way too many predator types! My proudest achievement use to be my
education...now it is that I survived an accident that should have
ended my life but I refused to stop trying to live and it
worked! Lost a lot of friends after that because people just don't know what
to say. So if you have a similar experience it would be great to hear about it.

Please no email relationships. I hate technology after long years being stuck 
behind many screens. 
Please send a photo and I will reciprocate.

I am seeking a very sweet submissive white male that is tall. I seek a true relationship and not sexual encounters. I am a black Bbw that is confidant and I consider myself to be very attractive. I would love a guy that wants a true relationship an that wants to be submissive in everyday life. I seek to explore life with an amazing submissive guy. Prefer that you are newer to the scene and wanting the same in a partner. I am completely single with no children and I seek the same. Please have a car, job and a place free of parents. Tried to keep it short because I really want to get to know a guy that enjoys a very alpha black Bbw in general. 

I'm not into married guys, felons or bi. Straight submissive guy that wants to start building a great foundation with a good person would be great. Send a picture of yourself And a little about yourself if your interested. Ages 26-36. I live in Seattle but am looking for a place more south. So you need to be fine with traveling but nothing crazy. Like Tacoma would be the furthest that I would go.

So I know this might sound strange, and I've never posted something like this before. I've been doing a lot of reflecting on what kinds of men I find myself attracted to, in a superficial sense, and as long as I can remember, I've been attracted to heavier men, even much heavier than ""normal"", or firmly in the obese category. I'm not really looking to talk a whole lot about this or have any explanation for ""why"", I'm posting this and putting it so bluntly out there because it's been hard for me to find people I'd like to get to know, even just as friends. I'm on the average side, have been told I'm attractive, and sane. Like yoga, books, the Internet, cute things, and making stuff. I'm not looking for something very sexual, or very casual- maybe something in between.
I've got a lot going on this month, so I may not get back to you soon. I'm pretty shy, and more inclined to talk to people over the Internet than I may be over the phone or in person. I'd like to learn as much about you as you'll allow me :) 
I'm poly, and in an open relationship, so jealous/controlling should probably not respond. I'm also okay with intimacy that doesn't end in intercourse. I don't want emailed dick picks.

Recently, all the cards have been falling into place and my life is feeling really good. So much of what I have wanted has finally shown up! Though, you know, minus that special someone. 

And with the promise of spring just around the corner, I'm ready to cross paths with a great guy and inject some more fun into my life.

I'm looking for someone who is interested in dating--even open to long-term. I'm not looking for a hookup or something suuuuuuuper casual.

True confessions: I like younger guys. But I really like tall (5'11""+), slender guys that are smart, funny, fast (witted) and fun, 30s- early 40s. If you also happen to be (heavily) tattooed, (and NEVER say ""tat,"") I'll be yours forever.

I am smart, kind, funny, artistic, ambitious, witty, direct, assertive and generous (please re-read ""direct"" and ""assertive,"" traits that do not mesh with everyone). I'm 5'6"", average build, dark-haired and pretty.

I like music and trees and water and food and bourbon and movies and epic adventures. Any overlap with you?

I am a loving and sweet female....when my needs and wants are being met. Honesty. 
I can be a bit of a domineering and condescending cunt-bitch when I feel you are slacking in the responsibilities I deem as yours though, and I am unapologetic in that.
I have goals, and they are the sole endeavors of your very existence. If you are not completely submissive in every single fucking way, we will not get on. 
When I am pleased with life and my relationship I am sugary as pie. When I am dissatisfied at all I become the thing you wish you had never met. There is ZERO in between. I am strict and my expectations are not for the faint of heart. 
I am not your fricking fucking princess, I am your Queen....period. I want every single whim of my heart captured and provided for by you, no exceptions what-so-ever. You have every resource I could ever hope for at your disposal, not for yourself at all, but for me. You have built your life banking on my finding you someday, and you are ready now. 
You will get what I say you can have and it will be sufficient, end of discussion. When I am content I will allow you to be spoiled almost rotten, but if I am not I will torture you in ways you've never even thought of. 
My love has to be EARNED, I do not give it freely, and the cost is HIGH. It is what I say, when I say....you are my much beloved SLAVE. 
I am intimidatingly beautiful, and I expect that you at least take care of yourself....although I am not often sexually inclined, I do not want to fuck ugly or stupid.

The first day of Spring in Washington! Time to start venturing out in the great PNW. I've been on here a few times as well as dating sites and I'm really starting to believe the Washington Freeze thing to be true! Dating as you get older is difficult to say the least...doesn't anyone want to share life beyond a couple hours in the bedroom anymore? I was married for quite a while so I understand the disappointment and pain when a relationship doesn't work out. But you still have to take chances and have hope! 

Please know that the way to a woman's vagina is through her brain. Sex is an important part of any relationship so be willing to work at it and not be challenged on an emotional or intimate level. I'm not asking for commitment here just honesty with monogamy or whatever we decide.

I hope to meet someone my age or close. I prefer blue collared, big truck driving, rugged and bearded handy men. (A girl can fantasize, and we all have a type so don't hate) I'm not so one sided that I wouldn't consider anyone if we click! But please, I don't do clingy or controlling as this implies lack of trust! I'm independent and can function without you but I want a man in my life to be my compliment.

I've recently come to find out I carry the HSV virus so please either have, understand or be accepting. It doesn't require banishment to a Herpes Colony but some make you think it does! Please educate yourself and don't share your negativity. I don't need it. I'm honest here and doing the responsible thing! I don't have breakouts or symptoms. 

So come on, get me out of the house and help whip my _ _ _ back into shape! I enjoy working out and activities but have had some injuries so I've been laying low and unfortunately put on a few pounds!! I'm still attractive and have no issues with my self-esteem. A good catch for the right man!

I do not smoke, worked hard to quit years ago! So no smokers please! No drug users except 420 is fine. I cannot partake due to my job and no alcoholics please! Been there done that for longer than I should have!

Please respond with a bit about yourself, where you live, interests etc;. I don't need a picture right away and won't send one first thing for obvious reasons. This is Craigslist, ads are free, and sometimes you get what you pay for or don't. Not into one word responses and please don't call me hun before we've met. Please, please be close to my age!

A+ for men that like garage sales and searching for a great find!

So I am a single woman with no children. I tend to be a bit of a loner at times. Looking for a guy that is the same way. You prefer to be alone rather then out with random people at bars and clubs all the time. I'm not the gamer type nor do I consider myself to be a nerd or into anime or anything like that. I just tend to spend time with a few close family members a a best friend. I tend to be home with my dogs and do things at home then out at the mall or something like that. A little about me. African American, single, independent, bbw/heavyset. Confidant and attractive. Obviously I would only be interested in guys that actually date black bbw women. Not just liking to try it out or have sex with a black woman. I am not an experiment now would I ever lower my standards and settle for any type of casual sex/ friends with benefits deal. I am not an experiment or an easy lay.

Other things I enjoy doing when in a relationship. Early morning errands, dog pars, state fairs, game farms, concerts from time to time. Being home experimenting in the kitchen. Movie theatres. The norm really. I don't drink or smoke. Not a fan of the bar scene either. 

I am seeking a serious relationship with a sweetheart of a man. Please be tall. I prefer white men. I don't mind if you are a little on the submissive side but I have absolutely no interest in anyone that considers themselves to be dominant or controlling. Looking to build a solid foundations with a single and childless guy. Please have your own things like myself and be between 25-35. 

Send a picture with your reply and more the one sentence about yourself. Messages that are detailed and show interest will be an immediate reply. Others will be deleted.

No need to reply if you have never been with a black Bbw or if you don't live alone. I am in the central area of Seattle so be Somewhere close to that. 

I am a black bbw that is in search of a tall submissive white male. I am looking to get my pussy eaten out from time to time. You need to live close by Seattle or within 10 miles. Able to host meaning that you live alone. Only into tall white subs that have a fetish for black bbw/ssbbw. No shame here. I love my body and I'm not afraid to show it.

I'm looking for an absolute true submissive guy. One that enjoys every aspect of submissive. Likes being owner by one domme and craves direction. I am sorry th normal gal. 28 years of age so I require that you be normal, liking for ongoing and very friendly. Maybe you don't mind actually hanging out outside of the bedroom? I would t mind it if we clicked after meeting in person. I get pretty bored where I live and would love to get wisked away for a random drive along the country side or to a movie. See, I'm pretty normal. 

As far as kink go: I'm wanting to try pussy worship, face sitting, light bondage, cbt, chastity and pegging. I'm fairly new so I'm looking for a partner to explore with that I trust. For now though, I'm just searching for a guy that has a fetish for go down on black bbw women. I come to your place, you eat me out. Make me cum good then I leave. More if there is a real connection. Definitely looking for this to be on going to you should have no attachments. Be single with no children. No unrest in married or separated men.

Yes I am seeking a female led relationship. 

I am seeking a very sweet submissive white male that is tall. I seek a true relationship and not sexual encounters. I am a black Bbw that is confidant and I consider myself to be very attractive. I would love a guy that wants a true relationship an that wants to be submissive in everyday life. I seek to explore life with an amazing submissive guy. Prefer that you are newer to the scene and wanting the same in a partner. I am completely single with no children and I seek the same. Please have a car, job and a place free of parents. Tried to keep it short because I really want to get to know a guy that enjoys a very alpha black Bbw in general. 

I'm not into married guys, felons or bi. Straight submissive guy that wants to start building a great foundation with a good person would be great. Send a picture of yourself And a little about yourself if your interested. Ages 26-36. I live in Seattle but am looking for a place more south. So you need to be fine with traveling but nothing crazy. Like Tacoma would be the furthest that I would go.

Hello!

I don't know what I want. Who can honestly say that?! 

I'm convinced it is because I haven't met the right man. I'm open to so many things, I'm open to change my point of view... to an extent of course. Different points of view, different opinions, expand my own. But, I am old enough to call bullshit when I see it!

I'm 34, blonde hair, blue eyes, hwp. Late bloomer, graduate student but hard working. Health is important to me and it should be for you as well. Fairly new to the area and LOVE to explore! So, take me somewhere new! Money isn't an issue for me, just be thoughtful. Love the outdoors, not afraid to sweat. I'm not picky, love all kinds of food and a good beer now and then! I'm a busy grad student but like to unwind when I can. Let's see where this goes! Looking forward to hearing from you!

I am a retired woman. I want to meet a man who is also retired so that we can spend time together. If you are still working, please, save both of us the time and do NOT respond.

I am 73, educated, petite, attractive, H/W proportional. My large eyes are hazel and my easy smile reveals shiny white teeth...which match my hair.

I live with three felines tho a sniff test would never reveal that to be the case. 

I am easygoing, humorous, enjoy being with people, tho generally in small groups or one on one.

My interests include reading (fiction, mysteries mainly) television (hour drama shows along with a few of the better half hour sit coms) playing board games, especially Scrabble.

I am into a healthy lifestyle which includes getting on the treadmill several times a week, maintaining a normal weight and being vegetarian, sugar free, additive and preservative free as well.

I enjoy going to movies, plays, concerts, exhibits and the like.

I am divorced and childless.

If your stats are compatible with mine and you are either divorced or widowed, I would enjoy hearing from you. I prefer someone within a few miles of Bergen County (Paramus area) so that we can meet on a whim when we feel like it.

Please tell me about yourself the same kind of things I have told you about me. AGE, MARITAL STATUS, EDUCATIONAL LEVEL and PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION are mandatory. For the recored, I am 5' and weigh 115.

I look forward to some quality replies from some quality people. A simple ""How ya doing?"" gets deleted w/o a response.

Hello CL,

I'm a single mom looking for a friend to hang out with, that has the potential to become more later on. 

First, let me tell you a little bit more about myself:

• I'm 22, but I've been told I'm very mature for my age. Unfortunately, I'm still undecided when it comes to knowing what I want out of a relationship. I DO know that I'm NOT looking for a fwb, a hook up, or anything that involves meaningless sex.
• I've only been in a couple relationships (serious or otherwise), due to the simple reason that I haven't been looking. 
• I'm not fat, but I'm not skinny either. I'm more pudgy than anything. There are times I diet and times I don't. Same thing with exercise. I don't consider myself ugly or beautiful. You can judge for yourself. (Pic4pic)
• I enjoy reading and writing original stories. I'm hoping to attend college soon so I can major in English and maybe get a degree in child care too.
• I sometimes watch popular tv shows (Doctor Who, Once Upon A Time, Criminal Minds, etc), as well as anime (Naruto, Attack on Titan, etc). Occasionally, I'll play video games too (Legend of Zelda, Kingdom Hearts, Mortal Combat, etc). Keyword: sometimes.

Now let me give you a list of preferences (because we all have them). I'm looking for someone:

• Between the ages of 22-29.
• Who has their own car and a job. (I do not have a place of my own because I'm helping my recently divorced mom take care of my younger siblings. So it'd be really nice if you had your own place so that we could have the option of hanging out somewhere private.)
• Mature, respectful, and patient. (No jerks please.)
• Not obese. (I'm not particularly picky, but I have my limits.)
• Light complected (not racist; just a preference.)
• Who is okay with me being a mom first. I have a 3 year old son that comes before everything else in my life. Even if we were to start a serious relationship, my son would always be first.

I think I've finished ranting. If you're interested, e-mail me a current picture and more about yourself. Don't be discouraged if I don't reply right away. My working and sleeping schedule can be a bit chaotic since I work the graveyard shift sometimes.

Please put your name and age as the subject line.

Tell me about yourself....

Basics: Age, first name, educational & professional background, where you grew up, etc...

Do you have any kids? If so, do you want more? If not, do you want any of your own? 

What are you looking for in a relationship (e.g. potential for long term -or- nsa fun)? 

Who are you (i.e. what do you feel defines who you are?) And what types of activities do you enjoy doing? 

Where do you see yourself 10 years from now (e.g. what do you envision yourself doing?)

Describe to me YOUR ideal/dream woman - physically and mentally. Is she blonde, brunette, a redhead? White, Hispanic, Black, Asian - or does ethnicity not matter to you? How tall or short is she? How old is she? Etc...

I realize that with a very general post like this, I will get a lot of responses, so if I feel there could possibly be a connection, I will definitely reply to you. 

Pictures are encouraged & I have many of my own to share. 

All that said, may we both find what we're looking for - whatever that may be! =)

So I know this is hard to comprehend, but I am looking for someone that can tell the truth. No lies, no bull. Here is where it gets tricky...I don't want a relationship. I want to have fun. I don't want to meet the family. I want to be discreet, but open with each other. You can have your own life outside of our playtime, and I will have mine. We can text during the week and get together sometimes on the weekends. Please don't use the ""L"" word or ask me to marry you. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear. Tell me the truth, if you are seeing someone else too, OK, tell me. Let's be open and have fun. I want to connect with someone in and out of the bedroom. Both are important. I am curvy, so be cool with that, I am. Be kind and respectful and I will reward you when we make it to the bedroom.

We are far from perfect but we have spiritual, emotional and physical affinities.

Let's get to know each other as friends first, perhaps enjoying wine-tastings, concerts, opera, walks by the water and light hiking/ walks in the park, dinner and/or drinks out (or in, when that feels right) and other fun pursuits together.

Now that we have established I'm a average, reasonable human with preferences, let's get on with this.
I'm not sure what I expect, other than you to be normal. Quirky is fine.
Please don't hit me up for sex nor a casual hook up. Just no need for that. If you're just going to type 3 words in your email, don't type any. 
I don't need to see your penis, I hear that's a thing on here.

When we are deeply wounded at a young age, we cannot handle the pain, so we find ways to dissociate from the intense feelings. Then, later in life, especially when we fall in love, these old wounds can get activated. Our beloved gets angry, withdraws, gives attention to someone else, says mean things, doesn't tell the truth, doesn't stand up for us, comes home late, wanders away in a crowded public place, misunderstands us, and so on - and suddenly the pain that has been pushed aside all these years comes roaring to the surface. We think that we are reacting to the present situation, but what is really happening is that the old, unhealed abandonment wound has been touched off. We might find ourselves suddenly enraged or falling apart with intense tears. Our reaction seems too big for the situation, yet we cannot seem to stop the inner pain. We might start to shake violently as the old terror finally erupts.

We want our beloved to take the pain away by stopping his or her behavior. If only he or she would not do the thing that activates these feelings, we would be fine. Yet until we actually heal these old, deep wounds, we will not be fine. We will always be vulnerable to having these wounds activated.

Healing the abandonment wounds does not happen overnight, yet it does not have to take years either. The first step is to be in Step One of Inner Bonding, tuning into our feelings with a willingness to take responsibility for our pain. Once you are aware that deep pain has been activated, seek the help of someone who can hold you and nurture you while you go into the abandonment pain. If no one is available, hold a doll, bear or pillow, bring in your spiritual Guidance, and nurture yourself.

It is often not advisable to seek the help of the person who activated the wound because: 1) he or she may still be stuck in their own wounded place, the place that touched off your wound, and 2) you might become dependent upon your beloved taking care of you and taking the pain away instead of actually healing the pain.

Once you are with a safe, nurturing person, or even on the phone with a safe person, hold a doll or bear or even a pillow very tightly and breath into the pain. Move into the intent to learn - Step Two - and allow the child who is in pain to give you information about the original pain that is still stuck in the body, Step Three. The body holds the memories that you repressed at the time, and now the body is releasing these memories. Many images may come up as you open to learning with your Inner Child. Be sure you have your spiritual Guidance with you, holding you, surrounding you with love and comfort as you open to learning about this deep pain. In order to truly understand your present reaction, you need to understand what happened to you when you were little. Keep breathing deeply and allowing your Child to inform you, even if you are crying. Tell the person helping you what your Child is telling you about what happened to you when you were little. It may take awhile, but gradually you will calm down. At that point, you can move into Step Four, asking your Guidance about the beliefs that may have come up during Step Three, and about what else your Child needs right now to feel loved and safe.

Being there for your wounded child this way will gradually heal the abandonment wounds. Ignoring your feelings, trying to make them go away, or trying to get someone else to take them away will only serve to re-wound you. It is only when you no longer abandon yourself that the old wounds begin to heal. Eventually, another's behavior that previously triggered your intense reaction will no longer do so. You may feel sad or lonely when a loved one gets angry or withdraws in some way, but as long as you continue to show up for yourself, the intense pain will not be there.
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP, GET BACK TO ME ASAP

Looking to end my 8 years of single life and settle down with the perfect guy for a long-term committed relationship. Love the outdoors, adore friends, family, sunsets, laughing, being creative, listening to music , etc---the list goes on. Am pretty low key and down to earth. I am a free spirited, fun-loving, sweet and caring person. I enjoy good wine, great food, pleasant conversation, all in that order. Love getting out even if it's by myself. I am a bit attention needy and clingy but, still just as beautiful of a person on the inside as I am on the outside.

I'm righteously open-minded and hope you are too. Not always politically correct, but rebellious against being stuck in the confines of what society perceives as normal. If you are curious about a very eccentric individual whose comfortable in her skin, I'm your gal. 

I'm open to dating single men in my area with a job, outside my race, between the ages 40-55, and with no young kids living at home. Please be drug and disease free. I am a bit old fashion and prefer a more traditional dating style. I am not interested in sex at this time, please don't contact me if you are.

Lastly, I prefer honest people and not creepy perverts. I don't respond to one-liner messages or emails without a picture.

Hope I am not asking too much and I look forward to hearing from you.

But seriously, I do like to just also be able to stay home and just relax, I'd say watch Netflix and chill but the meaning has changed nowadays. But honestly, I do enjoy hanging out at home, make dinner together and then enjoy a good movie.

Now that I have your attention, I guess I better get to my point! I'm on here because with having such a chaotic schedule, I really haven't had time to meet people in person. So here I am, on the cyberweb, posting about myself on craigslist. 

A little about me..
I have a full time job, I go to college, I have my own car, and my own place. I'm also extremely independent and self- sufficient, no time for games! I love to go hike, camp, fish, swim, take my dog to the park, go to the ocean, horseback ride, go shooting, and atving for fun! I love to cook and bake, as well. I'm also a huge animal person, so you must be as well.. or at least be nice to my fur babies. 

I would love to meet someone who has similar interests as myself, and who wants a long term relationship as well. Someone who has their life together, who is responsible, respectful, witty, affectionate, and spontaneous. Not looking to date anyone over the age of 30. 

If I sound like your cup of tea feel free to shoot me an email with a picture, and some details about yourself! Please put your favorite holiday in the subject line, happy Friday!

That is the progression I seek, with full of anticipations in discovering all qualities/substances of one another. Such joyous moments that would be.

With notifications of texts and e-mails, feeling my heart beat and smiling at kind words or silly jokes sometimes, I would like to feel alive. Whenever we meet, gradually, I want our affection to be stronger and more expressive to confirm our feeling and acceptance. There no rush.

I am an attractive woman with bubbly and exciting personality. I am always seeking for something amusing and mentally stimulating. And I wish to have an interesting, modern, professional, engaging, very fit and sexy, confident friend. Hopefully he is physically young but mentally mature.

Weeding out all guys who are married, attached or on rebound: sorry, I am off this drama and asking for the same. 
Not into religious guys: I know, God loves you too. Not into mutual masturbants or strap on and all shades of public crap either: my personal life and desires are not for share. Not into one-time deal: can't risk the outcome of liking you just once and be left with emptiness.
Not into body shoppers: if the look description matters before you've got an opportunity to meet up and figure out if there any connection, than do not expect from me any responses with my body exterior photos and technical specs/dimensions. 
Not into broke guys: your liabilities are totally yours before we even got to know each other.
Not into racists and nationalists asking for particular race/nationality/language: I speak English and other languages, hope, you too. 
Not into general mainstream and won't share your passion to seahawks, or mariners, or movie stars, or any other favorites-of-today.
Netflix is okay, unless it's the substitute of outdoors. 
Not into rudeness, so if it is a problem and you prefer to use derogatory language, it won't work with me. 
Now, few words on the positive side: very much entrepreneurial, very strong personality, world traveler, into actions, not into words. You will be able to share a drink with me, but not smoking weed: just not my thing.

I am looking for a long-term relationship with a man close to my age, someone with enthusiasm, who invests in the possibilities that life has to offer. I'm looking for a man who comes from a loving family with good values, as I do. You should be single, have grown children, educated, should work or have a career, be open-minded, self-aware, stable and have good sense of humor.

I know what I want and if that scares you the don't reply. Are there any real MEN out there ready to jump into something serious? The more I search the smaller my hope becomes. 

I am a SWF. 26 years old. No children. BBW; so if you are looking for a stick then you are reading the wrong ad. I am loyal and honest. Friendly and outgoing. Bubbly. College student. I am very 420 friendly. Family oriented and I'd do anything for a friend. I live on my own. I own my own car. My favorite color is blue, my favorite dish is lasagna, I love the smell of rain and I could play in it for hours, I love the smell of fresh cut grass so I really don't mind getting down and dirty when it's needed. I am not a girly girl. I like to wrestle around and enjoy my time wherever I am. I enjoy things like bon fires, BBQ's, being outside, going to the rodeo drive-in, music, movies, spending time together, and a lot of other things but let's save that so you have something to ask :) 

****you must be located in the kitsap area preferably Bremerton or Port Orchard****

I am looking for a man between the ages of 20 and 34. SINGLE. Employed. I don't mind if you have children as long as you want more ;) Pretty much have your life together and headed in a positive direction. 420 friendly. Enjoys being together. Looking for something serious. Gentle and passionate. Honest, trustworthy, and kind. Respectful. Must love dogs. Real man meaning I don't play games. Plain and simple. 

It is important to understand that no one is perfect and we shouldn't strive to change one another. Instead you learn to love the flaws. I want to be with someone who brings the best out in me and vice-versa. I want a long term serious relationship. I am talking eventually building a family. I don't want a fling, I don't want to sext, I don't want to be friends with benefits or f-buddies. I want something real. I need a real man ready for the real deal. I'm ready to start my own family and I'm sick of waiting while everyone else is getting pregnant and beginning their families. 

Please put your favorite color in the subject line and attach a picture. If you don't then I will delete it instantly.

Do you have a big beautiful ass or breasts, or are an admirer? Tired of people judging you over the appearance of your natural beauty cause it doesn't fit the stereotype? 

I am sure that makes a fine introduction to some, but we are seeking men and women of a different mould. This is why we started a new Kik group for the Seattle area. One where people can be sensual, seductive, alluring, funny, and enjoy sharing intellectual conversation with other mature adults. Those with class and a good sense of humor and who are not judgemental. People looking for a casual connection or maybe more. And most importantly, admire the best parts of a woman's body or want yours to be admired. 

If you feel like you would enjoy this kind of group, please join us on Kik, for a new kind of experience filled with men and women, rather than boys and girls.

Scan the kik code above to join the group. We welcome people from all over the Seattle area.

You can also email me your kik username and I can add you directly.

Let me start off my saying if you are married, have a girlfriend, or are looking for a fwb don't bother.

I have decided to take a new approach to this. I am looking for a man that will treat me right, make me feel good about myself, makes me laugh, is an all around nice guy. I have been with only 2 men in my entire life. I have not even cuddled with a man so I have no clue what that would feel like. Sad yes I know. Lets face it I have not had the best choice in men, and honest above everything. Honesty goes along way with me. I am 30 and looking for someone around my own age 28-35 give or take a year or two. I am blonde with blue/grey eyes 5'6"" my measurements are chest 51 1/2, waist 44 1/2, hips 48. Yes my chest is 51 1/2 which means men my bra size is 42G I have put my measurements on here because you will know exactly my size. I am somewhere between curvy and BBW depending on how you look at it. I am a very honest person you can ask me anything I am like an open book.

All of that being said I am into music I listen to all kinds, I love the outdoors and camping, laying in the grass at night just to look up at the stars, I am very family orientated, I love animals, visiting lighthouses, historical places, and being spontaneous. I guess you could say that I am just a random person. I also smoke cigarettes.

Please change the subject to your favorite color so I know you are real. Please please do not send me a pic of your junk I really don't want to see that. Put a pic in your reply or I will not respond. I will send mine in return.

Hello and Happy Tuesday,

I am seeking a discreet friendship with a MWM. I'm attractive, hwp and ddf and am seeking same. 

I'm looking for one quality relationship, and I'm very picky. I'm usually attracted to professional types who are smart, fit, clean and good looking.

If you can send a pic that would be great, but I'll understand if you have reservations too. But if you do send one, please don't send one with sunglasses on or a hat. Thanks. 

Have a wonderful day!

You are happy in your own skin, easy going and just an all out good guy!

I'm 24, liberal-minded, outgoing, passionate, and very 420 friendly. I am on the smaller end of plus size, brunette with long hair, and green eyes. I am a strong and outspoken person in my everyday life, but I like to take a submissive role in the bedroom. I only mention this because I don't like to waste anyone's time-including my own.

I'm looking for someone who is mature, funny, interesting, loyal, honest, and romantic to start something awesome with. I am really busy, but will make time for the right person (whether it's a friendship, relationship, or something in between). Open communication and trust are big for me. Please be at least 5'8"", SINGLE, DISEASE FREE, between 24-40, and have a car. (Also, please live within 30 mins from Bellevue/Issaquah.)

If you're interested, please send a recent photo of yourself and some info. If I find you attractive, I will be happy to send pics back! Have an awesome day! (I will not respond to messages with no photos attached)

Hey there :)
Let me be clear I am not looking to buy or pay for sex. We'd go dutch, so there's no pressure. I'd like to go out on a B-day date with an interesting, cool, funny single man....maybe dinner and a movie or a movie and dinner...no expectations, other than good company. I think it'd be nice if we chatted for a bit, and then if we decided to meet up for coffee, hot cocoa, tea, whatever and see if you'd like to take/go out with me for my B-day :) Just thinking it might be nice to spend 30 minutes or so together to see if we want to spend 3-4 hours together. I mean let's just see what happens. Also, since I'm not opposed to going out again it would be nice if you lived in kitsap county.
Things you should know about me...
I have hsv1.
I'm (turning) forty two, 5'2"" and 185 or so. A curvier lady, some aren't nice. I'm thick/big up top, with slimmer legs...
I have kids, so I can't just drop everything and come meet you. 
Also, I am not looking for instant gratification, I have Dick (my vibrator...lol) and you have Rosy palm if that's the case...lol This is about me being able to go out on a date with an interesting, cool, funny, single man :) Someone with the potential for more.
About you...
Be SINGLE!!!!
Be within 7 years of me.
Live in central kitsap or close.
Prefer white men.
Saturday would be the day...I got a sitter for Saturday.
Oh, and I'm not looking to move in with anyone...this is about one night, not the rest of my life...lol
If you've read this far and decide to respond change the subject line to what movie you'd like to see. Also, in your response tell me how old you are and what city you live, in, and anything else you care to share :)
TTYL :)
P.S. Also, this is not about sex....it's about going out to eat and the movie with a man who isn't on my friends list. If you're replying to this post thinking that I'm gonna jump in my car and fly like the wind to get to you and jump your bones, that's not gonna happen!!!! lol I wouldn't waste your time or mine by replying to my post.

I am looking for a man who is interested in a real relationship, taking the time to get to know one another in hopes of finding someone to build a relationship with. A relationship built on attraction, mutual interests, respect, laughter, joy, passion and a desire to be together. I am a large (overweight) woman who is looking for a man to spend the rest of my life with, nothing casual. I am posting because I believe that the man I am seeking does still exist and I am hopeful that we will find each other
NO LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS, they just dont work for me, please be within 50 miles of Kent so that we are close enough to actually spend some time together without huge commutes and get to know one another and yes this is a deal breaker. 

I work full time, I have a car and a place, you know all the usual stuff. I love country music, I love the water, I like to play bingo, I like to bowl, I love to watch a good movie, I love to cook. Lets listen to some music, lets drive to the beach, build a fire in the fireplace and watch the waves crash,, lets go see a movie on Sunday afternoon then stop for ice cream, lets find a dive bar and shoot some pool. You know it really doesnt matter what we are doing as long as we enjoy the company of the one we are doing it with. I miss having someone to do all the normal, silly things with.

The man I am looking for is looking for a real relationship and values the time it takes to get there, not a just quick romp. The man I seek is between 40-55. I am looking for a relationship that can grow and become something truly special. I am looking for my best friend, my companion, my lover, my confidante, my life partner.

It's Spring! It's nice to have friends, work, and projects to keep you occupied..but...
Wouldn't it be fun to have someone to to laugh with; do some wine-tasting; sample delicious food?
There are so many activities in the area--day trips--overnight destinations, or just the fun of simple grocery shopping for dinner that evening.
Wouldn't it feel great to have an intimate relationship with someone who really cares about how your day went?
I am attractive, well liked, love to laugh, and look/act younger than my age.
I would like to meet a nice man who can handle Christmas lights, little children, bad drivers, and other potential challenges with a modicum of patience and understanding. 
Someone who understands the true meaning of respect and consideration. 
You must like to freely give and receive affection; yet realize that quality physical intimacy requires friendship first.
It would be great if you enjoy good music of any kind--I would like to go to concerts, and would especially like to hear something special at Beneroya Hall (have never been).

I am open to new experiences--but I will include my absolute deal-breakers here:
*No cigarette smokers; daily drinkers, or daily MMJ users. (Ok--so it's legal...and perhaps a really cool concert would be a negotiable infrequent exception.)
*No one night stands--chemistry is important, so please don't be overweight, and do look and smell nice. I promise you that I certainly do!
*No married men--I realize for you it's ""thrilling"", but I just don't share well with other women.
*I am the one who wears the lingerie--and sorry, but no, you can't borrow it...
*I am absolutely not interested in wearing a collar and calling anyone ""Master"".

Thanks for reading my ad.
I do wish you well and trust you will find what you are looking for...

Yes, I am real. I have posted seeking one who is a good match. I dont bowl and big wild cruises a e not my ticket. While I appreciate far away smaller cities and love nature it doesnt work dating away. Oddly c/l men seem to invite women to drive down to meet them! Ha!

I am fair and try to understand motivations and points of view. I cant do traffic rushes. No response to resp w/ no age, no location and lack of literary skills shown in describing life.

We - you and I are or do
+ active and bike (10- 20 miles in summer.. 6-8 now) , hike (3-5 miles), go to yoga , gym, music festivals. I do power yoga- not ""we're better than you"" yoga style love to find another who loves this.. but I can not be your teacher or coach.

+ love outdoors-go to mountains and beaches for short hikes, walks and nature appreciation. Parks are beautiful right now!!

+ very healthy eating- /lowGMO or processed, some organic. Health is as health does.

+ traveled; value broad worldview; might live in central america for awhile.

+ work part time, active and happy in service- whether work or volunteer.. 

I workout, yes-watch tv, read, write .. been to Costa Rica 8 times, bike alone, kayak with a group,, love my friends and family. Love dogs and cats.

No- I do not eat out at mass food chain places, nor do I go to malls or bowl or golf nor groupthink.

Let's go out on the town today or stay in and enjoy each other... I want someone to wake up next to and sip tea smiling from ear to ear...My curiosity has driven me thus far... I want to date a white man that is fit and healthy because I value someone who works out and eats clean. I am thick maybe even some would consider me a bbw (but who looks amazing thick and is in a sports illustrated cover this year?) I am mixed race Jamaican and Hawaiian I love bright eyes and blonde hair (but hey who can be picky here?). I also don't mind anyone with a/uno/one kid because I have one as well and value Great parenting. Heck that means more activities! I consider myself a catch I'm attractive, fit (hwp), I have a career, a car (paid off), my own place, no debt, I take care of myself hygiene wise and the way I dress. I like to cook for my man and be a confidant but not smoother a guy... I'm a hopeless romantic and allow past relationships to be a tool to making my ultimate relationship successful. I guess I'm unapproachable when I do go out?? or maybe just too engrossed in my own vibe lol. But either or I am not truly enjoying my singleness (some days are great some suck) so here's a shot in the dark!! All I ask is you be goal oriented and attractive also above 6'0 if possible I can't deal with a short guy and I'm pretty short. They say cuffing season is over I say f*ck that let's get corny and ride the Ferris wheel then stare at a beautiful view at Kerry park :-) ( hopeless romantic)..

I am getting to old for games. I have been hurt badly on here. I want a long term relationship hopefully in my home on a 10 acre hobby farm. NO LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS. !
Anyway I decided this morning to post once again. I am happy widow with a lovely place to live in. It sets on a 3 acre beaver pond which I have planted with fish but otters came. I love animals and someone who comes here will have to love them too. I raise akc shetlandsheepdogs aka shelties. Like small collies. 
I don't smoke, drink socially, fun loving. like to fish, dance, cook, garden, can my veggies and ride my horse. I still show him in competition..I collect eggs from chickens so yummie. raise Turkeys too. Love working on my little hobby farm. I work most of the day outside. Rain is ok.. I heat with wood from my property. I jog to stay in shape and take long walks on my mile long dirt road. 
I am attractive in fit shape 5ft 3in. 140 pounds. muscle weighs more than fat. I go to bed early and get up early. Enjoy my friends on facebook sending updated pictures to them from my life here. I have a big group of friends. Like home cooking and sitting by my woodstove in morning and maybe evening too. My hang up is I am 75 ys old almost 76. but no one believes it. my friends call me the energizer bunnie. I garden, can food, eat healthy, and ride my horse actually even compete with him. I am a christian..
Not into games at all. Be sincere or don't answer. I want someone to share my life with I like intimacies and cuddling very much. Have long dk brown hair streaked with grey. Or maybe I should say the other way around. ha ha ... If you like to joke around I am easy smile or laugh. 
For instance-- yesterday I fed horses, take care of two others and then chickens and turkeys. wanted to populate the area but all of them stayed. (Raised 19 baby turkeys last year. had to sell some...)worked on a new pen for puppies. Went in my green house and planted some early things. Drug hoses around dogs following me all the way. They sometimes try and trip me playing. I then worked in kitchen a bit and went out again to give lunch to horses and feed my cow I am raising. I fill up her feeder sometimes with my kubota tractor and she is good for a few days. Watering is a job. horses , cow chickens. And green house too now. Did tighten up fixtures in green house as they were leaking and spraying me too. ugh! Did some wash, I am very clean about myself wear make up every day almost. Make my own jewelry and for gifts hope to attend a bazzar with a friend end of month so I work on that. Made my dinner eat sensibly and retire early to read. I love to read it puts me to sleep. Like Westerns and mysteries. 
No health problems. My mom lived to be 99 worked till she broke her hip at 86. I hope to copy that life style. Oh I have been widowed for now 4 years. So some pictures I guess. I go to church and my congregation raised money for a new roof. Men my age don't work out as I am to active for them....Linda

Hello ~

I'm coming back to Seattle starting March 24th and it would be extra nice to meet someone while I am on my mini-vacation. No matter if it rains, all the better to duck into a cafe and have a nice glass of wine or other warming drinks.

I'm a 57 year old SWF, fit and active. I love live music, world travel, baseball, good food, road trips, and all forms of the cultural arts.

I've lived in Seattle for 6 years so I know the area well. I can't wait to drive around the old neighborhoods to see all the new growth.

I am a pretty normal woman and nice looking (slim/fit) I have my own car, home, friends, and a life. I'm totally willing to swap pic a with you so please provide one.

You should be easy going, around my age, any ethnic background. Just be cool, friendly, spontaneous, laid back--up for anything. I appreciate a funny sense of humor, a lively personality, and good taste in art, food, and music.

Put your favorite city in the subject line and I would appreciate a picture please.

Throw out some ideas that would be fun and interesting during my visit too!

Hello, 
I have tried this once before with no results so I thought I would give it another shot. 

I am a single bbw on the edge of being ssbbw. (If you don't know what that is please dont waste my time or yours) I am single but have obligations which makes a typical relationship difficult. I hate saying that I am looking for a FWB because sex isn't exactly what I am seeking but I would like more than that so to speak. Lol a BEST friend with perks maybe?? :) Although just friends is fine by me. Someone to hang out with n have fun with... Hold on to at night, I make a great pillow btw. 

Maybe you are someone in a similar situation as myself and unable to commit to a relationship for whatever reason. Maybe you miss some of the things about being in one and dont want to sleep around in search of what ur craving like myself.

I have a pretty open mind and probably the least judgemental person you could ever meet. So dont be shy a shoot me a message. Be real and upfront and honest with me. You will receive the same in return. I am a easy goin, low maintenance plain jane type, clean d&d free as you should be too. If you are a tall guy or a heavier set guy I would love to hear from you but i wont exclude anyone. Leave the name of your favorite color in the subject line.

Hi there! :)
Are you sick of the games?
Are you trying to find your happily ever after?
Are you ready to settle down and have a family?
If you answered yes to these questions look no further.

24 years old
Chubby 
Single mom of two wonderful children.
Adventurous 
Outdoorsy

Short summary about myself: 
I ride dirt bikes, quads, snowmobiles, jet skis, I camp, I get muddy, I play. I fish and when I say fish I mean I FISH I'll bait my own hook, cast my own line, reel in my own catch, and clean it myself guts don't scare me lol. I love to have bonfires and just relax. I love to read and have tons of books of all different sorts. I love rock music (especially classic rock) I'm a big horror/thriller movie freak, my favorite holiday is Halloween I love haunted houses and go yearly.

My children come first and you will not meet them until I know you're in it for the long haul they do not need to be in revolving door relationships they deserve someone who is going to love them and treat them as their own.

Yes, I am real. I have posted seeking one who is a good match. I dont bowl and big wild cruises ar enot my ticket. While I appreciate far away smaller cities and love nature it doesnt work dating away. Oddly c/l men seem to invite women to drive down to meet them! Ha!

I am fair and try to understand motivations and points of view. I let others merge and stop for pedestrians. I cant do traffic rushes. No response to resp w/ no age, no location and lack of literary skills shown in describing life.

We - you and I are or do

+ love outdoors-go to mountains and beaches for short hikes, walks and nature appreciation. Parks are beautiful right now!!

+ very healthy eating- /lowGMO or processed, some organic. Health is as health does.

+ traveled; value broad worldview; might live in central america for awhile.

+ work part time, active and happy in service- whether work or volunteer.. 

I workout, yes-watch tv, read, write .. been to Costa Rica 8 times, bike alone, kayak with a group,, love my friends and family. Love dogs and cats.

Are you seeking companionship during a difficult time where you wish it would just be over with, so you could move on with your life? I'm not looking for a man who wishes he was separated from his wife, but who truly is. Someone who would be understanding of this type of situation. The middle time before the divorce is final. Some may call it a rebound, but sometimes rebound relationships do last. I'm not looking for a hook up, so if you are don't reply please. I'm looking for a genuine man who has it together, i.e. stable job, car, etc. I do as well. Non-smoker, no drugs, social drinker, over 5'10"". You would understand that mutual attraction is important, so if it's not there it's okay to just move on. Meeting this way is not the best, but it's worth a try. I will not reply to a 1 or 2 sentence email. Please tell me about yourself. Give me a reason to want to reply. I also prefer to communicate and swap photos via personal email. If you don't, don't reply. Change the subject title to ""Springtime"" so I know you read this and are serious. Must be local only and close in age.

Let's start with the fact that I am an alpha female and seeking a submissive man for a long term relationship. I am african American and in my last 20's. I am very much attracted to white men. Tall and skinny white men. Ones around my age too. Looking for a sweetheart of a man that is also tired of being single. Maybe your finding it hard to find a woman that truly enjoys and is seeking a submissive man. Yes, it's true that most women are turned off by that fact but I am not. Quite the opposite actually. Very turned in by a man that enjoys submitting to a woman in the bedroom but also in everyday life. I seek a gentleman that isn't only seeking to submit sexually but in every other way as well. If you seek a true woman that loves a submissive make then let me know. Reply with a picture and a few facts about yourself. Don't miss out on the real deal. I know that your as tired of being single as I am. Just hard to find a genuine submissive man.

Honest to a fault here.

I'm 26 5'9, long brown hair, bbw but hey if your a boob man I'm your gal 😉. I love bake, Bon fires, long drives, movies, farmers markets, and family oriented. I'm shy at first but get over it pretty fast. I don't smoke of any kind and drink occasionally.

I'm ready to find someone to settle down with. I'm sick of the games. I don't want a random hook up or fwb.

I know I'm not everyone's type and that's fine but what I'm looking for is a clean cut, honest, fun, taller than myself like 6'1 up, doesn't live to far and between 26-33.

So I am a single woman with no children. I tend to be a bit of a loner at times. Looking for a guy that is the same way. You prefer to be alone rather then out with random people at bars and clubs all the time. I'm not the gamer type nor do I consider myself to be a nerd or into anime or anything like that. I just tend to spend time with a few close family members a a best friend. I tend to be home with my dogs and do things at home then out at the mall or something like that. A little about me. African American, single, independent, bbw/heavyset. Confidant and attractive. Obviously I would only be interested in guys that actually date black bbw women. Not just liking to try it out or have sex with a black woman. I am not an experiment now would I ever lower my standards and settle for any type of casual sex/ friends with benefits deal. I am not an experiment or an easy lay.

Other things I enjoy doing when in a relationship. Early morning errands, dog pars, state fairs, game farms, concerts from time to time. Being home experimenting in the kitchen. Movie theatres. The norm really. I don't drink or smoke. Not a fan of the bar scene either. 

I am seeking a serious relationship with a sweetheart of a man. Please be tall. I prefer white men. I don't mind if you are a little on the submissive side but I have absolutely no interest in anyone that considers themselves to be dominant or controlling. Looking to build a solid foundations with a single and childless guy. Please have your own things like myself and be between 25-35. 

Send a picture with your reply and more the one sentence about yourself. Messages that are detailed and show interest will be an immediate reply. Others will be deleted.

I am looking for a partner. I am in my 50's and have been single for a long time. Nearly married 20 years ago and am glad I didn't because I couldn't get used to Manhattan where my ex-fiance will live until death. In a rent controlled apartment.

My background includes a wealth of education and if someone would pay for it (no more loans) I'd get my PhD for the fun of it, in social psychology. I recently was able to retire early so want to travel, either via road tripping or cruises. Don't enjoy flying much and have done it way to much in the past for work and play. My credit is perfect and I only have one visa card. I have been looking around for a good travel group, to places that are not boiling.

My sense of humor is wicked and I love film and art. I would love to go to film school yet am going to start making short videos with my new camera and see what happens. Love animals, used to ride horses and have a small sweet cat. Long time volunteer for our local art organizations. 

It would be great to meet someone with a current passport and the freedom to explore. And who enjoys the fun of road tripping to small towns and resorts. Great conversation is an art form I love, and laughing at life. No family left so friends are very important to me and while I love Seattle due to the art scene, am tired of the freeze! It is so hard to make new friends, good grief!

Other things that interest me are the paranormal, things that go bump in the night, civil, human rights, saving our environment, saving our country which is so in debt that it could very well crash tomorrow and then we all get to make gardens and eat our own chickens etc., sustainable farming, left leaning politics (please if you don't agree, then don't write, just delete), plays, community markets, comedy sitcoms, organic food (long time member of PCC), driving just for fun, art openings, cooking, painting, drawing, walking, politics, cold cases, journalism, sustainable farming any coast that isn't covered with garbage, photography and hanging out with someone I like/love.

I am a Scorpio, very intelligent and am interested in meeting people who are looking for real partnership, not just entertainment, sex.

Please send along a photo and I will reciprocate. Responses without a photo are deleted without being read and blocked.

Hey guys,
I am a 34 year old single female living in Maricopa. I am smart, slightly sarcastic, very geeky and compassionate person who is looking for a serious relationship. I don't want to rush things, but I would like to be in love someday. I wouldn't mind friends either, but I am not into friends with benefits or a no strings thing. I recently got out of an abusive relationship and it taught me what I want in a man and what I don't.

I am looking for someone kind, smart, funny, compassionate, someone who loves animals and is looking for a geeky girl with tattoos and weird hair. Because of living in Maricopa anyone I date has to have a car. I have no problems driving to Chandler, Mesa, Gilbert ect but I don't want to be the only driver. And I don't care if you work at Burger King, or Intel but a job is a must because I want an equal partner and not to have to support someone.

I take care of my disabled mum, work full time, own a home and vehicle and do animal rescue. I love to watch tv and movies and enjoy bowling, mini golf and walking around window shopping, holding hands and laughing at crazy stuff they sell. I also love to swim and often do overnight trips to Harrahs to swim and have fun. I also love trips to Vegas and have always wanted to be able to wake up on a Saturday and drive to Cali and go to the beach and see the sunset then come back or get a cheap room somewhere.

If I sound like someone you'd like to know send me a message and we can get to know each other. I love to text my friends and family and would like to text with you as well so we can have little conversations through the day instead of having to formulate a big email with a ton of questions.

ETA while I appreciate pictures and it'seems nice to see who im texting, please no naked pictures below the belt. Let's save some mystery. ..and again please no fws or nsa. I like benefits and strings with the right person.

I want someone to inspire, and someone to be my inspiration. I am into many things art related, so it would be interesting to get to know another creative individual.

No idea what to say here so I am going with straight to the point!

Looking for a guy that can make me laugh, but be serious when needed. Prefer taller then myself I am 5'6"". I have no real preference to hair or eye color. Someone that can carry a good conversation enjoys going for a nice drive from time to time. Farmers markets, working in the yard, lazy days inside doing nothing at all, social drinker, non smoker, 420 ok as long as it's now and then not a daily thing. 

Now onto a more personal level no offense to anyone at all again looking for Mr Right for me.
Someone who can hold their own in the bedroom, endurance, and some nice size equipment by that I prefer bigger then average please. Good hygiene a must, job, car, all your own teeth, and close to my age please 40's - 50's. Also I am a bbw, but assure you I can see my own feet and only require one seat when flying ..... lol

If any of this has caught your attention don't hesitate and let's see if we have some chemistry, and reply with a picture.

Thanks

A little about me. . .I am 34 years old and curvy. I love being active and outdoors doing things like sporting events, movies, concerts. . . pretty much anything that is music/sports related! I like to smoke pot and chill too. I am independent and drama free. No kids and no crazy ex's. I love to laugh and make the best of situations. 

I am looking for someone that is honest, loyal, and fun loving. I need someone with a great sense of humor, and has confidence and swagger! ;) I am not judgmental and seek someone who is also open minded. I want to find someone that enjoys spending time with their partner and values their relationship; someone who sees a relationship as a partnership and enjoys encouraging each other to be the best they can be. I hope to find a gentleman that knows how to treat a lady, but understands that she is not helpless. I love to cuddle, like to show affection and, let's be honest here, I really miss making out! 

Your pic gets mine.

Honest to a fault here.

I'm 26 5'9, long brown hair, bbw but hey if your a boob man I'm your gal 😉. I love bake, Bon fires, long drives, movies, farmers markets, and family oriented. I'm shy at first but get over it pretty fast. I don't smoke of any kind and drink occasionally.

I'm ready to find someone to settle down with. I'm sick of the games. I don't want a random hook up or fwb.

I know I'm not everyone's type and that's fine but what I'm looking for is a clean cut, honest, fun, taller than myself like 6'1 up sorry I don't date shorter, doesn't live to far and between 26-33.

Greetings! I'm a tall (5'8"") single mom with not a lot of free time for going out, but I'm attempting to date anyway. 

I love hiking, but find that I'm a li'l fair-weather about it; camping, festivals and fairs, and any other adventures we can discover. I'm increasingly busy during the daytime, but I do like to communicate a LOT through e-mail and text and love ""sneaking in"" time together whenever possible. I enjoy a quiet evening in just as much (or even more than) an exciting night out. I also like to cook as a social activity.

I'm not looking for anything too serious at the outset, but ultimately would like a long-term, monogamous, committed relationship. So if any of that scares you, no fault to you; but please move along.

With those things in mind, here are some things I find attractive: 
•	Intelligence (preferably college-educated, as I am),
•	Excellent conversation/writing ability,
•	Humility, 
•	Emotional availability, 
•	Openness to public displays of affection (nothing gross, but I am pretty lovey), 
•	Patience, 
•	Understanding, 
•	Clean criminal history,
•	Commitment to social justice, with the heart of an activist (Go Bernie!),
•	Light-light drinker and addiction free, 
•	Lover of live music, 
•	Kind to animals, especially my dog, and 
•	Financial stability, which does NOT mean you have to be rich! We survive on my budget, but I can't support you, too. 

I like guys taller than me--the taller, the better; and HWP (sorry, but it does matter). I also prefer dark hair and eyes, though I honestly put the other qualities I mentioned before looks. I live in Enumclaw, so I don't want to have to commute of more than one hour to see each other. I hope to move to the Eastside within the next five years, so it's a bonus if that's where you hail from (although plans can change and I'm cool with that).

So. . .. Yes! If you are SINGLE or DIVORCED, between the ages of 37 and 47, and fit my criteria, let's talk! My life's pretty busy, but I'd like to make some bright(er) spots and hopefully build a lasting partnership. While I recognize that things often don't work out, that is my goal...

Please change the subject of your message to your name and location, and please include at least one recent picture. All of my pictures were taken this month, so you would definitely be able to pick me out in a crowd ;-)

In your message, please tell me:

•	Your profession (I'm NOT screening for rich guys! Just be gainfully employed :-) )
•	Your age (37-47)
•	Your favorite pastimes, and
•	Your preferred choice of music, and
•	What makes you unique.

(This is a test. Have you read this far?)

I hope to hear from you soon!

First off, if you are super shallow, we won't be working out very well. I'd like to find my partner to handle this crazy world we live in. Someone with whom I can share my goals/desires/aspirations with and work together to accomplish them and vice versa. I am NOT looking for a casual relationship. I also don't think it is wise to get married while still in the growing phases of my life. But I'd like to dream and know that is where the relationship is heading. I need a man to deeply influence my life. I want to be able to teach someone what I have learned in the 24 years I have been alive as well as learn more from that other person. I want someone to push me to reach my full potential. I want to experience growth together. I don't want to change the person I meet. Which also means I don't want you to pretend to like the things I do. Differences are important! We don't have to like all the same activities. But let's try new things and step out of our comfort zone more times than not. Everyone on here has at least three things in common:
1. Everyone wants love
2. Everyone wants to be loved
3. No one is satisfied

I am still young but I am focused on my life. Real progress and real adventures. Please put your age in your email headline so I know you are real! Pic for pic. Thanks.

Decided to take a diff approach. No flashy photos or provocative subject lines. Im just a girl, standing in front of the internet, asking it to send her an equally (or moreso) nerdy guy, with a killer smile and penchant for witty banter and conversation.

Me, im a 30 year old black lady, curvy. Not looking for anything for serious really, just some good company for netflix and chillz and whatever comes from that.

Im inclined to wait a bit of time before we exchange photos. I want to undress your miiiiiinnnnddd, man...

Jk jk, but really, im hoping to find interesting people to talk with and then hopefully more! Ive been told I look pretty fly, so i promise you're not falling into a fugly trap.

I just ask that the following basics are met: you are 25-40 +/- a couple years in either direction. Youre in the greater Seattle region. You're adulting at least at a mediocre level (job, self sufficient, can construct a proper sentence and exhibit the reading comprehension of a learn-ed human being).

Ok humans of CL, give me your best!

I'm looking for someone that is willing to be my FWB. And I really mean friends and I really mean benefits. ""Friends"" is defined as a person who is willing to text thought the day, exchange snarky e-mails, and periodically talk about things other than junk. As an aside, please walk on by if you're not willing to move forward into this situation. I really don't want to have to convince you to be my buddy. It's demoralizing for both of us. And also don't be shocked that I won't jump into the backseat of your car for a dirty hump after exchanging seven e-mails. I actually like to know the person whose junk I'm enjoying.

I present as a put-together professional (because I am), but I am highly experimental and generally down for most anything. I'm not a sleaze, so you will actually have to talk to me before we get to the interesting stuff. Just sayin'.

Discretion is essential. Your picture will get mine. But definitely not until I feel comfortable with you. Trust that I'm not a troll. Also trust that I'm not a swimsuit model.

Points if your politics are left of center, your Fridays are solid blue, and your taste in music is defensible. You know who you are. 

Please, be older than forty, taller than 6', and willing to be a pen pal before you become my peen pal. Intelligence and sense of humour are non-negotiables. I am chatty; prepare to be talked at about all manner of topics and musings.

Also, to answer some FAQs:
--I've never experienced black cock; if the person attached to the cock is cool, I'm sure I'll enjoy.
--I'm wearing underwear. No, you can't have it.
--I think motorcycles are a fast track to organ donation. No, thanks.
--I have a sister. No, thanks.
--I'm not keen on being your slave, at least not until we share an ice cream cone, or something.
--Yes. I'm getting slammed with responses. 
--Yes. I've posted with this ad as before. I'm still looking.

Guys, if you're going to send dick pics at least make them interesting. Like conversation piece interesting. Be creative! Think fashion accessories. Hats on penises are hilarious after a couple of beers. I'm always looking for material to show my girls at Happy Hour.

Good morning, 
I've been browsing cl for a little while in the back of my mind looking for a Dominant. I know, its not the ideal. What can i say. .curious mind. It hit me this morning maybe who Im looking for is just like me casually looking here with something specific in mind. So here goes:
I'm not very experienced but I've been curious about the lifestyle for about 8 years now. I had constraints that prevented me from exploring; now I don't. 
I'm looking for someone somewhat experienceed.
If your the type that thinks you need to force your dominance to get my submission please look elsewhere else. I'm looking for someone that wants a submissive for a relationship not something short term. I'm not looking for a one night stand or someone who's into having more than one partner. Please be drug and disease free. 
I'm looking for someone kind and strict and someone who knows both the mental and physical part of it. I know you really cant have one without the other. Submission for me is very mental.
I'm naive to things im sure. If your looking for someone experienced that is not me. What I am though is educated, curious, well spoken, old enough to know better..yet here I am. 
I prefer someone in their 30s. I'm 29. 
Please be kind..and don't be creepy. Lol that is all I ask. It might be a tall order. Haha here goes..

I will try and keep this as short as I can so that we may be able to talk and get to know each other away from this site. 

Let's start with the fact that I am an alpha female and seeking a submissive man for a long term relationship. I am african American and in my last 20's. I am very much attracted to white men. Tall and skinny white men. Ones around my age too. Looking for a sweetheart of a man that is also tired of being single. Maybe your finding it hard to find a woman that truly enjoys and is seeking a submissive man. Yes, it's true that most women are turned off by that fact but I am not. Quite the opposite actually. Very turned on by a man that enjoys submitting to a woman in the bedroom but also in everyday life. I seek a gentleman that isn't only seeking to submit sexually but in every other way as well. If you seek a true woman that loves a submissive make then let me know. Reply with a picture and a few facts about yourself. Don't miss out on the real deal. I know that your as tired of being single as I am. Just hard to find a genuine submissive man.

Me ~
I'm loyal, dedicated, honest, loving, forgiving, a great Mom, my dog loves me. I'm in medicine, so I'm a people person. I'm compassionate, a great listener. If you ask me something , expect me to tell it to you like it is.
I'm the marrying type ( Or I was. Maybe again one day) I would prefer not to be the girlfriend forever or dating forever type. I was raised to be the girl that raised a family and loved her husband. I believe in family dinners. I cook every night for my kids, clean my own house, do my own laundry. And I have a career.
But I also need adult time. I have a great sense of humor, I'm a bit of a smart a**. But I can take as much teasing as I give. The outdoors are a huge love for me. Hiking, Biking, Camping Skiing, Wine Country. Travel! Weekend road trips are a favorite.

My kids live with me full-time year round, I have 2 of them.There is no drama with my ex husband.


Who I'm interested in :o)
So here it is. I'm done with playing games. I know this seems harsh and direct. I just am at a point in my life where I want to be with someone that can handle their affairs. GET YOUR CRAP TOGETHER!! If you have a simple divorce and a couple of kids , Great! But leave the DRAMA LlAMA out to pasture and be ready to start something NEW. It's time to move on and let it go! Life is to short to waste!
Please make sure your kids are ok with you dating and that you don't have to sneak around to do so, or worry that if you ever introduce them to someone that they will hate them right off the bat , due to past hurts!

I have two wonderful kids from a previous marriage. They are the most important things in the world to me. So is my family.
So, I want someone in my life that I can do great fun things with. Who loves kids, dogs, an occasional gummy fruit flying from the back seat. Who likes weekend road trips, hiking, wine tasting, music, fun dates, bbq's with friends. Fishing is a new adventure for me, and I love it as do my boys. I would even be open to learning how to hunt!
So let's start with some honesty, be great at communication, you must love kids, dogs, traveling. Laughter and humor. Life is way to short to be serious all the time. Sometimes things happen, and seriously, you just have to laugh it off. Have a career, a passion, something you love to do. Be emotionally and financially stable. I'm ok with someone having kids, but I cannot have anymore.

I'm also ok with someone in the military.(Army, Marines or Air Force, Navy) Just please be stationed on JBLM or in the state of Washington. I understand deployments, and all that come along with it. ( Several emails have asked me that )

Are you a one-of-a-kind kind of man? Unique and very smart? Big-hearted and communicative? We might make beautiful music together.

I'm passionate, selective, educated, liberal, humanitarian, attractive, and kind, in search of a man with similar qualities, an educated, clean-cut, decent, professional man with a high standard for himself, as I have for myself, who is also seeking, ultimately, a real and loving relationship. 

We are far from perfect but we hopefully have spiritual, emotional and physical affinities. Hard to find, but is one to stop looking because it's rare?
I haven't given up...yet.

Let's get to know each other as friends first, perhaps enjoying wine-tastings, concerts, opera, walks by the water and light hiking/ walks in the park, dinner and/or drinks out (or in, when that feels right) and other fun pursuits together. 

Too intense too soon, in my opinion, doesn't usually work too well.

I'd love to see a photo and know something about you. Looks are less important to me than the chemistry factor, mutual respect and compatibility.

Please, include your approximate location, your age, and photo if you reply. 
And please be 45+.

Prof SWF seeks professional SWM 64-72 - active with similar lifestyle-- blessed with health and optimism. Yes, we are older slow down.. but lifestyle of activity keeps one going.

Yes, I am real. I have posted seeking one who is a good match. I dont bowl and big wild cruises ar enot my ticket. While I appreciate far away smaller cities and love nature it doesnt work dating away. Oddly c/l men seem to invite women to drive down to meet them! Ha!

I am fair and try to understand motivations and points of view. I let others merge and stop for pedestrians. I cant do traffic rushes. No response to resp w/ no age, no location and lack of literary skills shown in describing life.

We - you and I are or do
+ active and bike (10- 20 miles in summer.. 6-8 now) , hike (3-5 miles), go to yoga , gym, music festivals. I do power yoga- not ""we're better than you"" yoga style love to find another who loves this.. but I can not be your teacher or coach.

+ love outdoors-go to mountains and beaches for short hikes, walks and nature appreciation. Parks are beautiful right now!!

+ very healthy eating- /lowGMO or processed, some organic. Health is as health does.

+ traveled; value broad worldview; might live in central america for awhile.

+ work part time, active and happy in service- whether work or volunteer.. 

I workout, yes-watch tv, read, write .. been to Costa Rica 8 times, bike alone, kayak with a group,, love my friends and family. Love dogs and cats.

No- I do not eat out at mass food chain places, nor do I go to malls or bowl or golf nor groupthink.

Hi, 
I'm in my 50's and divorced, and am looking for a ltr. I'm not looking for someone to just have sex with. Please read all of this before you decide to judge me. I am an overweight woman. I don't have an ugly face. I have had a torn meniscus that has made me put on some of the weight. I have recently lost 20 pounds and am continuing to work on that loss. I am not a couch potato. Sure, there may be a few things I can't do like skinny women; however, I am far from not being active. 
If you're still reading this, please continue. A hig part of my life I have been judged by my weight. A lot of men don't give women like us a chance. I am a very loving and compassionate person, who is a good listener and wants to be there for the man I care about. I believe in honesty and trust. I believe in being faithful. I am a very sensual woman who believes in being intimate with the man I have a relationship with. I have a big heart. Just give me a chance to show you who I am before you judge me. That's all I ask. I'm not perfect, but no one is. I am real, though. 
Thanks.

I am a SWF. 26 years old. No children. BBW; so if you are looking for a stick then you are reading the wrong ad. I am loyal and honest. Friendly and outgoing. Bubbly. College student. I am very 420 friendly. Family oriented and I'd do anything for a friend. I live on my own. I own my own car. My favorite color is blue, my favorite dish is lasagna, I love the smell of rain and I could play in it for hours, I love the smell of fresh cut grass so I really don't mind getting down and dirty when it's needed. I am not a girly girl. I like to wrestle around and enjoy my time wherever I am. I enjoy things like bon fires, BBQ's, being outside, going to the rodeo drive-in, music, movies, spending time together, and a lot of other things but let's save that so you have something to ask :) 



****you must be located in the kitsap area preferably Bremerton or Port Orchard****



I am looking for a man between the ages of 20 and 34. SINGLE. Employed. I don't mind if you have children as long as you want more ;) Pretty much have your life together and headed in a positive direction. 420 friendly. Enjoys being together. Looking for something serious. Gentle and passionate. Honest, trustworthy, and kind. Respectful. Must love dogs. Real man meaning I don't play games. Plain and simple. 



It is important to understand that no one is perfect and we shouldn't strive to change one another. Instead you learn to love the flaws. I want to be with someone who brings the best out in me and vice-versa. I want a long term serious relationship. I am talking eventually building a family. I don't want a fling, I don't want to sext, I don't want to be friends with benefits or f-buddies. I want something real. I need a real man ready for the real deal. I'm ready to start my own family and I'm sick of waiting while everyone else is getting pregnant and beginning their families.

My bestie needs a plus one for tonight for a casual night at the casino. She knows I am posting this but I told her I would screen. She thinks its embarrassing. She will buy her own drinks(if she even drinks tonight), you buy your own. 

Her: 50. 5'6ish. Long hair. Pretty. *slightly* overweight(actually just has a tummy she needs to get rid of). Beautiful smile. SMOKES. (I know, she is working on it). Has some ink.

You: Close to same age. 5'10 and over(this is not negotiable). Decent looking. Nice smile. Sense of humor too. Please be able to drink responsibly.

Important things: This is not a hookup. You will NOT get laid. You will meet at the casino. Bonus if you are capable of acting like you did not just meet tonight(this is my idea).

I will be screening all pictures. Yep....this will be MY choice for her. My idea. Yours gets hers(only fair, right?) 

Please don't send me your dick pics. Just your pic and how you fit into the ""qualification list.""(Lame, I know.)

She is an incredible woman!

Looking for someone that is super laid back and a bit of a loner does not mean that I'm looking for a fuck buddy or a ""cuddle"" buddy. No, that is not what I seek at all. 

So I am a single woman with no children. I tend to be a bit of a loner at times. Looking for a guy that is the same way. You prefer to be alone rather then out with random people at bars and clubs all the time. I am not the gamer type nor do I consider myself to be a nerd, into anime or anything like that. I just tend to spend time with a few close family members a a best friend. I tend to be home with my dogs and do things at home then out at the mall or something like that. A little about me. African American, single, independent, bbw/heavyset. Confidant and attractive. Obviously I would only be interested in guys that actually date black bbw women. Not just liking to try it out or have sex with a black woman. I am not an experiment now would I ever lower my standards and settle for any type of casual sex/ friends with benefits deal. I am not an experiment or an easy lay.

Other things I enjoy doing when in a relationship. Early morning errands, dog pars, state fairs, game farms, concerts from time to time. Being home experimenting in the kitchen. Movie theatres. The norm really. I don't drink or smoke. Not a fan of the bar scene either. 

I am seeking a serious relationship with a sweetheart of a man. Please be tall. I prefer white men. I don't mind if you are a little on the submissive side but I have absolutely no interest in anyone that considers themselves to be dominant or controlling. Looking to build a solid foundations with a single and childless guy. Please have your own things like myself and be between 25-35.

Hello All,

I am a SBF seeking as SWM for a Long Term Relationship. I am 5'5, light skinned, with a few extra pounds. I'm mostly attracted to taller, stocky build, bearded, outdoorsy type of men. Someone that has strong positive values, can communicate effectively, has a zest for life, and overall, a good natured individual . 

I'm a big kid at heart, but can be serious when I need to be. I'm not a workaholic, but prefer to stop and smell the roses often. I enjoy home life as much as I enjoy being out in nature. Please be somewhat active. If you consider yourself a couch potato, hmmmm, we would not be a great fit. 

I enjoy traveling , camping, hiking, whitewater rafting, music, the Arts and exploring this beautiful state we live in. I'm a non smoker and light drinker. If you're the same, that's a major plus. Generally, I'm a happy and blessed individual . I'm easy to get along with and prefer a drama/stress free life style as much as possible. I prefer to make love, not war. I never go to bed angry. I prefer to address issues, find a solution(agree to disagree too) and move on. I'm affectionate, sensual, loyal and monogamous.

Trees are blooming, crocuses are blossoming, and there is a promise of good things in the air!

I'm looking for my good thing--a fantastic man interested in enjoying the spring, and all it has to offer! And maybe even extend the fun into the summer. And fall.... 

I'm not looking for something causal or a hookup tonight--I'm looking to meet someone interested and open to dating (but we get to take time to determine if it's a good fit with us).

I am smart, kind, funny, artistic, ambitious, witty, direct, assertive and generous (please re-read ""direct"" and ""assertive,"" traits that do not mesh with everyone). I'm 5'6"", average build, dark-haired and pretty.

I like music and trees and water and food and bourbon and movies and epic adventures. Any overlap with you?

Just a few final words--I've provided a decent amount of (true) information, so won't respond to emails of ""hey!"" Please tell me more. Also, I'm in central Seattle. If you're not, and like to drive, cool. But I'm not interested in treks. Finally, I'm not ""God-fearing,"" or am I interested in being a ""princess."" I am a rather hip, urban, independent, child-free (by choice!) woman looking for someone equal to play with!

I will try and keep this as short as I can so that we may be able to talk and get to know each other away from this site. 

Let's start with the fact that I am an alpha female and seeking a submissive man for a long term relationship. I am african American and in my last 20's. I am very much attracted to white men. Tall and skinny white men. Ones around my age too. Looking for a sweetheart of a man that is also tired of being single. Maybe your finding it hard to find a woman that truly enjoys and is seeking a submissive man. Yes, it's true that most women are turned off by that fact but I am not. Quite the opposite actually. Very turned in by a man that enjoys submitting to a woman in the bedroom but also in everyday life. I seek a gentleman that isn't only seeking to submit sexually but in every other way as well. If you seek a true woman that loves a submissive make then let me know. Reply with a picture and a few facts about yourself. Don't miss out on the real deal. I know that your as tired of being single as I am. Just hard to find a genuine submissive man. 

I am in Seattle. The south end of Seattle. I do not date married or attached men. I prefer a guy without children as well.

In search of my daddy Dom. I am into abdl and ddlg... I enjoy being babied and love my binky, bottle and diapers/ pull ups. I wasn't someone gentle and kind. I am not into rough punishment or cruel words. I like the bondage of being diapered and the idea of belonging to someone.

This is a part of who I am and I want someone who can appreciate me for me.

Good evening. 

Today was my only day off this week. I slept in because I slept like crap last night (as usual). Then I went and got a massage. It was a rare treat and long overdue - a gift I received for my birthday, 4 months ago. After that, I picked up my youngest child from school and took her with me on a grocery shopping adventure. Then I stopped back home for 45 seconds, during which time I handed off my youngest to my middle child, along with a frozen lasagna and instructions to put it in the oven. (The lasagna, not the child) Back out again, off to pick up my oldest from practice, in my usual state of lateness. That one reminded me about the 5 or 6 essentials I forgot at the store (and, it's Thursday so the cute bagger is working) so back to the store we went. Home. Dinner. Dishes. Homework. Lunches. 30 minutes of playing a board game. Now, the younger 2 are in bed. I'm sitting on my oldest child's bed while that one finishes homework. I'm folding laundry and wondering if you are out there......

I'm telling you all this because I'm just a normal person. A crazy busy single mom who is essentially defined by my children. 

Who are you? 

You are that man who wants to remind me that I'm a woman. Who realizes that while I am working so hard to meet everyone else's needs, I have needs too. You are a non smoker and a non liar. You are employed and supporting yourself and maybe some kids. You understand that my time is precious and my kids will always come first. You are patient and understanding, but not over-sensitive. You can handle my sarcasm, and you will occasionally join me in being silly. You like sports and being active. 

Now, you just need to find me......

Hello there~!

I am writing this ad in hope of finding ONE amazing man to date. I am off on weekends, and often find myself lonely due to no family in the area and pressures of work and maintaining my own home during the week. I work very hard and live a nice, clean life. I am a great catch and have a lot to offer to my future boyfriend. Abut me: Sweet, caring, honest, sincere, supportive, romantic and intelligent. I also have a great sense of humor. I am also very attractive, sexy and all that good stuff but I am seeking substance as looks don't offer long term benefits.

Interests: Fine dining, wineries, comedy shows, night life, shopping, traveling and cooking.

Men ages 28-40 need apply. 

Please be gainfully employed, attractive, great hygiene, healthy, have your own car and place and be honest and sincere. Looking for romance and great times.

Let us start this weekend, I have a few ideas in mind. We can start with a nice meal, or something fun. No coffee or drink meet ups those are not dates.

If you are interested in getting to know this sexy, feminine and girly woman send me your information and let us plan the best weekend ever~!

I'm college educated, quirky and think that sex and pot were the best combination to find out about since moving here, lol. I'd like to find a partner who is also a canibus enthusiast. I'm not looking for a hookup or a fwb, or even a studly young guy wanting to be with a much older woman, please don't ask. I'd love for more than just a hi to see if I'm a bot, lol. I have a strong sex drive and have always been attracted to geeky/artistic skinny men. I'd prefer 38-52, I want passion and a best friend. I want to check out places and hear good music or play pub trivia or hang with good friends. I'm very straight forward and speak my mind. I'm silly and people feel comfortable around me.

Now, admittedly maybe I listen to too many podcasts, or I've seen one too many romantic comedies; but I keep waiting for that big cinematic moment when I find ""THE ONE"". I also love run-on sentences. 

I'm 25 years old. Not old but caught in that awful phase of watching all my friends get married and have kids. I don't want those things tomorrow or even in a year...but someday I'd love that. 

Craig'slist is a cesspool for the weird, sexual, deranged and also people just trying to sell their lawnmowers. I know this. This ad is pathetic at worst and whimsical at best. 

I love Charles Bukowski and foreign films. I love the smell of sunscreen, and putting milk duds in my popcorn. I love philosophy and critical realism. I love insensitive jokes even though I'm an advocate for equality and social justice. I always put my elbows on the table when I eat and I always need a napkin. I like hearing people compliment one another. I love eating delivery Chinese food on a rainy day. I love laughing so hard that it makes you cry, or crying so hard that it makes you laugh. I think Roseanne is one of the funniest sitcoms that was ever on television. I buy and read too many books at once so I'm always reading two-three at a time. I eat Spaghettios straight out of the can and I have a scar on my thumb from trying to open a can of Spaghettios. 

I'm quiet, but I laugh loudly. I'm opinionated but I speak carefully and with thought. 

I maintain the dream someone will see me and be blown away as if they just had the wind knocked out of them; and I'll feel the same about them.

I am looking for something out of the ordinary. I want someone who is kinky as I am. I look totally normal and act like a lady in the street but get me behind a closed door that all changes. I am looking for someone who will be 100% submissive to me. 

I am a dom. Some of the things I am into are
-Bondage
-Pegging
-Whipping
-Pain for you
-Anal Stretching
-Worshiping 
-Being Forced to do something

I do have a few hard limits which are non negotiable. 
-No Pee
-No Poop
-No Blood
-No Marks

The more I think about life the more I realize I am ready to settle down and start building something. 

I have my life together. I am going to school, I love my job, I love where I live, I have amazing friends, and a loyal puppy... But there seems to be something missing from my life. 

I miss having dinner ready when my bf gets home. Snuggling up against someone and having his arms wrapped around me. I miss the passion. The foreplay. The tension. The crazy in love feeling.

A little about myself. I am 25, Asian, full time student at UW, work full time, love the outdoors, hiking, cooking, trying new things, road trips, etc. I am more of a jeans and t-shirt type of girl that a nails and make-up type, not to say that I can't do nails and make up on special occasions. I am compassionate, caring, loyal, trusting, and have a big heart that has gotten me in more trouble that I can count. I am terrified of snakes, I can touch my toes, I love carbs, I can drive a stick, I am a dog person. What else would you like to know? 

If you think we would get along feel free to email me and tell me something about yourself. The more effort you put into your response the higher the likelihood I will respond to you. All one liners, emails asking for a pic, and men with bad grammar will be deleted. 

To prove I am real... We had a crazy wind storm rip through here earlier this week.

Simple little notes hidden only where you can find them, a tasty little treat where you would least expect it. The text at just the right moment letting you know that I am thinking of you, the illuminating smile that shines on our faces when we see each other at the end of the work day. The thought that you have my back and I have yours, the plans we make that gradually come to life. How sensual of a massage I will place onto your body, needing the depths of my love deep into your zones, the fragrances that will be in the room when we are together...

Looking for the things that are similar to you, with flexibility and much room to grow. Serious in my search, might we find a way into each other's hearts?

Hello!

Something about me????
Let's see...
I love constantly learning new things and getting new skills. I get kind of obsessed with projects. I've learned and become adept at sewing, photography, cake decorating, choreography, some stand up comedy and a lot of other things I can't think of at the moment. Those are the most recent ones, anyhow.

Also do you LOVE working out and going to the gym! That's great!
I don't =)
Go Pro that shit and we can watch it together later.
Maybe.
Probably not.

But just know that I'm really proud of you.

Like so proud that I'll brag about it to other people and they'll ask me what you do at the gym, and I'll be like, ""soooooo much. You know, like a Belly Brawler and the Kitten Trap. He looooves the Kitten Trap.""

And if you're someone who feels the need to let me know that ""curvy"" means ""fat"" then yes, you are correct. I am fat. Curvy is what is called a euphemism. Welcome to the wonderful world of words! Stay awhile, won't you?

I'm independent and enjoy time on my own immensely. 

I have a 16-18 year old cat with asthma and no teeth. Whenever he catches a mouse in his mouth, the mouse gets treated to a deep tissue massage. A little on the gummy side but his intentions were to kill so...

But I tell my cat that he did kill the mouse. At least the ""old"" mouse. The ""new"" mouse after facing life or death (with a limbering massage) is now a completely different being and can take chances and live life to the fullest.

As long as my cat forgets to use his claws.

Laughing and playing is really important to me. I like to have a partner-in-crime to do silly stuff with and carry out fantastical projects.

For example - would you like to start a band together?

I can't play any instruments nor sing but I think it would be really fun.

Another example - do you want to share a couple bottles of wine and paint a blank 6 foot by 6 foot canvas together?

Example No. 3 - YOU come up with one! I've already thought of two. Jesus...

Example No. 4 - That was a really great idea you came up with! Why don't we try doing the same thing but with sponge cake?

Example No. 5 - Okay so the sponge cake got everywhere and I'm sorry that it hit you in the eye and made it black and blue. But you picked up pound cake instead of sponge cake and pound cake is like, a pound heavier than a sponge sooooooo...you knew what you were getting into.

Example No. 6 - I'm not going to clean it up. That's why we have a dog.

Example No. 7 - Can you clean up after the dog?

Example No.8 - Can you say/ do that thing that makes me laugh?

Example No. 9 - HA! Can you do it again?

Example No. 10 - HA! Can you do it again?

Example No. 11 - HA! Can you do it again?

Example No. 12 - HA! Can you do it again?

Example No. 13 - HA! Can you do it again?

Example No. 14 - HA! Can you do it again?

Example No. 15 - HA! Can you do it again?

Example No. 16 - HA! Can you do it again?

Example No. 17 - HA! Can you do it again?

Example No. 18 - HA! Can you do it again?

Example No. 19 - What's this? You made a ringtone of it for me so you wouldn't have to keep doing it?! Awwww! Thanks!!! You're the best!

Example No. 20 - ...

Example No. 21 - Can you call me?

Example No. 22 - HA! Can you call me again?!

And so on...

If you got to the end of this, congratulations! You survived approximately one ADORABLE minute of being with me.

It's pretty cool? Yes. I thought so too.

^ The ""yes. I thought so too"" only applies if you indeed thought it was cool. If you didn't then I hear there are some Beanie Babies for sale by a lovely old gal named Erma on here.

And no I wasn't high when I was writing this. And if you don't believe me and were wondering what caused the high, then you're out of luck because I'm a prick and I wouldn't share anyways. 

Unless you have something of equal value such as a treasure map. 

(pregnant pause)

If the first thing you thought of was sending me a dick pic with the caption ""It's not a map but here's a treasure trail"" then we can't hang out because I've already thought of it and I already don't like you.

But I'm sure you're a very nice person IRL...

Have a great day/morning/ evening/ night/ drug trip/ jail sentence!

Thanks!

I like being a squid, can squirm with the best of them. And I got them suckers. Oh oh. Yep I'm goofy. There's the bad goofy, gal just cut your throat while your sleeping, and there's the good goofy, gal just made you laugh till you puked. That's me. Not puke the other thing. I hate cable and only watch free tv and dvd's. I'm not paying those assholes to jack me while they crush me with commercials! Don't do dark meat and that includes tacos! Eww. Like my Scan guy or classic white trash works for me. Don't ask me what age I like; grow a pair. Super clean with a simple rinse and super natural with no make up on my pillow and no chemicals for you to kiss! Just the real thing. Red head with nice braids and frecks to count while I snore, pale green eyes and tiny hooters. Yep I'm honest and realistic. We are only here for a short time and we should enjoy our time and volunteer too. I'm Rhonda and I seek my high station man about the capstan, a dogeared sort to jam along a country trail with time honored songs and food from long ago and countries long gone. Talk to me and let me woo you.

White collar for White collar. Only.
I am looking for a partner. I am in my 50's and have been single for a long time. Nearly married 20 years ago and am glad I didn't because I couldn't get used to Manhattan where my ex-fiance will live until death. In a rent controlled apartment.

My background includes a wealth of education and if someone would pay for it (no more loans) I'd get my PhD for the fun of it, in social psychology. I recently was able to retire early so want to travel, either via road tripping or cruises. Don't enjoy flying much and have done it way to much in the past for work and play. My credit is perfect and I only have one visa card. I have been looking around for a good travel group, to places that are not boiling.

My sense of humor is wicked and I love film and art. I would love to go to film school yet am going to start making short videos with my new camera and see what happens. Love animals, used to ride horses and have a small sweet cat. Long time volunteer for our local art organizations. 

It would be great to meet someone with a current passport and the freedom to explore. And who enjoys the fun of road tripping to small towns and resorts. Great conversation is an art form I love, and laughing at life. No family left so friends are very important to me and while I love Seattle due to the art scene, am tired of the freeze! It is so hard to make new friends, good grief!

Other things that interest me are the paranormal, things that go bump in the night, civil, human rights, saving our environment, saving our country which is so in debt that it could very well crash tomorrow and then we all get to make gardens and eat our own chickens etc., sustainable farming, left leaning politics (please if you don't agree, then don't write, just delete), plays, community markets, comedy sitcoms, organic food (long time member of PCC), driving just for fun, art openings, cooking, painting, drawing, walking, politics, cold cases, journalism, sustainable farming any coast that isn't covered with garbage, photography and hanging out with someone I like/love.

I am a Scorpio, very intelligent and am interested in meeting people who are looking for real partnership, not just entertainment, sex.
do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers

What comes to your mind ?
What do you think I am 
referring to? 
Wouldnt it be nice IF we could start out on the same page? 
For example: chapter 1 page 1....
No wait.... That's not true .... :)
1st there is the page I must dedicate to someone right? 
So I dedicate this to you... 
""The man of my manifestation"" for I am creating you in my mind, heart and soul as I type these letters for you to read.
Then there are the chapters that await us! So... Let's get started shall we? ;)~
Craigslist is the vessel in which I arrive to you today... So lighten up a little and let's learn how to play!
You must have a passion to be happy, healthy, wealthy & wise.... In all levels of life, mentally physically spiritually, emotionally & finincially! 
If you get out of wack....
It is up to you to get back on track! ....Yackety~Yak don't talk back!... ANYWAYS,
The 1st question asked me, 
""What type of posting is this?"" 
I chose •personal/romance 
So YES I would like to""take the time"" to PERSONALLY get to know you & once things progress in a normal natural fashion then of course ROMANCE is definitely in order! :) 
I'm not looking for sex/texting buddies im looking for a naked man to wake up to every living day for the rest of my life. I am certain he will enjoy waking up to morning delight! As well as at night and anytime inbetween! Knowing our intimate apatite is on the same level of great passion and intensity yet realistically knowing we will not both be ""in the mood"" at the same time THEREFORE IT IS BOTH OF OUR PLEASURES to be READY, WILLING & ABLE to invest time in eachother not out of obligation but out of selflessness & joy 
Then it asked me,
which of these fit best? 
I chose • dating/romance 
Dating refers to spending time to invest doing things together, this includes talking on the phone as well as getting together by going out or staying in once we are comfy doing so. So YES,
romance we can refer to in the game of life as ""the baseball diamond!"" Not everyone gets a home run at his 1st up to bat so for this YOU should consider yourself thankful & greatful! You must work your way across each plate and make contact in doing so IN ORDER to score a run at home! Do you follow me?
Please choose a category:
I am a woman seeking a man. 
My man adores me as I adore him. ;)~ Our friends make fun of us secretly WISHING they have what we have! :) the natural ability to enjoy eachothers company full of playful banter and sexual innuendos. We are light hearted & energetic full of life! We enjoy hiking, biking, walking (dogs)The Tripple Door,(dining out) Thai, Mexican, I enjoy cooking & helping hands in the kitchen as you distract me with yours while mine are too busy to stop you but then again why would I? nature, (I enjoy photography) we also value a well balanced lifestyle, knowing we are what we; think, say, eat & do! We do create our reality! 
There is NO getting around it unless you live in denial. 
Choose a location that fits best:
I chose • Eastside 
Then it tells me, please do not post phone# email addresses or URLS in personal adds.
Note: this means you too!!! 
Ok ok okkkkkkkkkkkkk now that I have complied with Craig,
And if you are still here good luck & stay thirsty my friend!

I'm a central american woman, I'm single, working 2 jobs dealing table games. I have a BA in illustration, and certs for language translation.

I like to draw, and paint, and love learning new languages. I live on my own, and like to stay in cooking, or playing video games. Im not into clubbing or the bar scene, I do enjoy karaoke, but I'm much more content with a good book, comics, and smoking herb, and rarely drink, so if you were to be 420 friendly that'd be awesome.

What I'd like is a well mannered man of Asian decent, who enjoys talking, and can hold his own in a conversation for mental stimulation.

I am in Seattle. I'm looking for a nice guy to be in a relationship with. A relationship that is based on trust, loyality and understanding. I am in my late 20's. Independent and always have been. Never really had family around to help. I am a good woman who is completely single with no children and seeking the same. 

I am african American and Bbw. So obviously I'm only interested in a white guy that prefers black Bbws. No, I am not looking for friends with benefits. I seek a true relationship with no games or lies. I am always straight up with who I am and what I want from a man and relationship. I don't settle for being treated wrong, called names or cheated on. I don't like drama or disfunctional relationships. So I am looking for good man that knows how to maintain a healthy relationship that is honest and open. I would love someone that knows how to sit and talk about things rather then getting angry all the time. Sometimes I'm a bit closed off and I need a guy that is willing to support his woman and that will always have her back. I do have a strong personality and like controlling my own life so naturally if your the dominant/controlling type then you'd be the wrong guy for me. I prefer someone more laid back and that goes with the flow. Has no problem letting me choose things or even welcomes it so that he's not always planning things or guessing. 

As you can see, I'm looking for the real deal relationship with all the ups and downs. I need to make this obvious, I do not sleep with men that I don't see a future with. It's counter productive and I don't like confusing a guy with sex or myself for that matter. I'm in control of my body. Looking for someone open minded if it does become something more. I am a bit alpha. In and out of the bedroom so I want a guy that would enjoy that from time to time. I really hate bringing that up before even getting to know a guy but most men think with their heads. The little one. So there it is. If your interested then message me with a picture. Please have your own things and at least going in the right direction of having them. I live in the rainier valley area and I'm looking for a nice white guy between the ages of 25-35. 

No married/attached men. Not interested in bi guys or men in open relationships either. I have no children and expect the same.

I will try and keep this as short as I can so that we may be able to talk and get to know each other away from this site. 

Let's start with the fact that I am an alpha female and seeking a submissive man for a long term relationship. I am african American and in my last 20's. I am very much attracted to white men. Tall and skinny white men. Ones around my age too. Looking for a sweetheart of a man that is also tired of being single. Maybe your finding it hard to find a woman that truly enjoys and is seeking a submissive man. Yes, it's true that most women are turned off by that fact but I am not. Quite the opposite actually. Very turned in by a man that enjoys submitting to a woman in the bedroom but also in everyday life. I seek a gentleman that isn't only seeking to submit sexually but in every other way as well. If you seek a true woman that loves a submissive make then let me know. Reply with a picture and a few facts about yourself. Don't miss out on the real deal. I know that your as tired of being single as I am. Just hard to find a genuine submissive man. 

I am in Seattle. The south end of Seattle. I do not date married or attached men. I prefer a guy without children as well.

Hello ~
You won't hear me whining or complaining, I am content; therefore more accepting. I've gotten more than my fair share of experiences and life has been kind to me so I am patient when it comes to finding someone to settle down with. No forcing it, no pressure. 

I've traveled very far and near and hope to do more in the future; I'm a curious and resourceful person. I know myself well, quirks and all. I know I love good food and appreciate the finer notes. I can cook some interesting meals but love to see someone else in the kitchen working their magic. Seattle and San Francisco has such kitchens. And New York City - one of my fav towns.

I know how to take care of myself and I hope you know how too. I dabble in yoga, love to ride my bike and you can talk me into taking a hike (as long as there is a promise of a picnic) Sure, you might be little chubby, but you are smart and loving - that matters to me. 

And isn't it the best when after a glass of wine or two, the conversation starts getting interesting.... being with someone with that spark of recognition. And off we go into the night, maybe some live music? I'm not opposed to opera, ballet, symphony, musicals or a cabaret (actually love a cabaret). 

Write back if you have something to say. I will delete you if you give me one sentence. Let this be a moment when you can relax and say something meaningful. Give it a try, I'll be waiting and look forward to seeing your picture. 

Cheers ~

Hello...So I'm looking for something serious and long term. I'm tired of all the games and want to find a nice guy who is looking for the same. What am I looking for...well here is a little of what I would like a guy to be like...
Please be single and not in a relationship or hung up on your ex. I am looking for some one to make memories with...Be funny, fun, out going, honest, caring, smart ass, sweet, giving...just a good guy. And again please be honest...no point in lying the truth always comes out. As far as looks go, I don't really have a type. I think personality is a big point in finding if some one is cute or sexy. If you are military...Big bonus. Yes I have a thing for military guys. I can't help it. We all have our thing. :)
So a little about me....
I'm 32 and live in Bremerton. I have a job, its nothing fancy but it pays the bills. I have an apt that I share with my dog. No room mates. I have a car as well...pretty much have everything I need, only thing missing is an amazing guy. 
If any of this sounds like you and you would like to get to know me more...send me an email. I will send a pic when it gets to that. Please change the subject line to the city where you live so I know you are real.

Hello, 

I had a posting on here called ""Reaching out"" 

If you wrote to me with a sincere intent and haven't heard back I apologize. If you wrote something nasty and you haven't heard back, I don't. Lol

I got a lot of responses. I tried replying but got overwhelmed, and then discouraged. But I know there were people who actually took my ad seriously, but I can't tell anymore....Is everyone just trying to get laid? 

Am I an idiot for thinking I can actually make a real connection on here???

Could you please write again, if you were interested, and are a real person who is looking to connect on a deeper level???

Please know my ad was honest and everything I wrote was true. I have also misspelled the word compass and felt horrible about it lol

With that being said, I would hate to think I missed out on a nice person. Or worse, some nice person reached out and now feels ignored. I know it takes a certain amount of courage to put yourself out there. Thank you, if you did.

Please be close to Renton. Please don't be full of shit. Please don't be a swinger. Please don't be a hater. 
Please know who you are. 
Please be comfortable around and not threatened by an outspoken, smart woman. 
Please be available and not a serial dater or killer. 
I am a looker (I see the way guys look at me lol), but I don't think I am pretty, neither do I want to be. I am unique, interesting and I have that presence about me, and a smile that lights up a room. The smile is sincere, and so am I. Always :-)

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that friends with benefits generally fail because the relationship is neither friendly nor beneficial.

Look, here are a few of the things I do with my friends: Go out to eat food! See movies! Watch television shows! Enjoy culture! Drink! Go. . . support them in things! 

Here are some things I do with my boyfriend: Go out to eat food! See movies! Watch television shows! Enjoy culture! Drink! Go. . . support him in things! Have sex! Cuddle!

Here is what a friends with benefit relationship is supposed to consist of: all the things you do with your friends, but also, sex.

Please see ""what I do with my boyfriend.""

Let's be honest. The arrangement would more accurately be classified as ""sex with people you don't like very much, who don't provide terribly good sex because you don't like them terribly much and thus can't communicate what you want.""

Could we go back to having lovers?

The difference between lovers and friends with benefits isn't that having a lover lasts longer. From what I can glean from all the books, the relationship with a lover was fundamentally doomed, and everyone knew that going in. The difference is that there was supposed to be emotion in the scenario. People were, in fact, supposed to revel in the emotions. Part of the fun of being lovers -- whether it's of The Bridges of Madison County variety or the Paolo and Francesca variety -- is that, for the time the relationship was occurring, you were expected to care intensely about the other person.

To hell with friends with benefits. Let's bring back all the emotions. All the emotions that accompany lust with an inappropriate person, anyway.

Or, we could just date.

Are you a one-of-a-kind kind of man? Unique and very smart? Big-hearted and communicative? We might make beautiful music together.

I'm passionate, selective, educated, liberal, humanitarian, attractive, and kind, in search of a man with similar qualities, an educated, clean-cut, decent, professional man with a high standard for himself, as I have for myself, who is also seeking, ultimately, a real and loving relationship. 

We are far from perfect but we hopefully have spiritual, emotional and physical affinities. Hard to find, but is one to stop looking because it's rare?
I haven't given up...yet.

Let's get to know each other as friends first, perhaps enjoying wine-tastings, concerts, opera, walks by the water and light hiking/ walks in the park, dinner and/or drinks out (or in, when that feels right) and other fun pursuits together. 

Too intense too soon, in my opinion, doesn't usually work too well.

I'd love to see a photo and know something about you. Looks are less important to me than the chemistry factor, mutual respect and compatibility.

Please, include your approximate location, your age, and photo if you reply. 
And please be 45+.

""In Spring a (young) man's fancy turns to thoughts of love""....hopefully we can welcome in the spring together. Thanks!

Well, here I am again, posting on Craigslist and it's just another day.

I could turn this into a long ad about things I like and dislike, instead I'll focus on things I want and need. I mean, seriously, if those aren't going to be fulfilled, why bother, right? Of course, if you don't fit all the criteria, don't let that stop you from replying anyway. At the end I'll cover the quick basics about me if you're still around and reading. 

Things I need or want:

Someone who can type in actual sentences. I'm not a grammar Nazi, but if you can't take the time to reply in whole sentence, then I'm not interested. Also, paragraphs. Those are good. 

Intelligence. I need someone who can have a conversation, someone who can appreciate dry wit and sarcasm, and someone who knows they aren't always right, but loves the chance to prove they are. 

Someone who doesn't feel the need to be dominant all the time. Sorry, doms. I'm not the sub you're looking for. I do enjoy a bit of spice now and again, but if it involves face slapping, spitting, or generalized humiliation and degradation, we wouldn't fit together well. 

Someone who has common interests as I do. If you like playing video games, reading sci-fi/fantasy books, binge watching Netflix, prefer your laptop over your television, eating good food at decent restaurants, don't think that hours spent surfing the internets is a waste of time, watching Ted Talks, learning new things, and prefer to spend Friday nights at home conversing instead of sitting in the club, then we might have some things in common. 

If you think the moon landing was faked, that global warming is an evil gov't plan, that abstinence only should be taught in school, and that our country should be more evangelical, chances are we won't get along. If you use the words ""false flag"" as part of your common vernacular, chances are we won't get along. 

Me: I'm in my late 30's. Smart, sarcastic, and always wished I could lift just one eyebrow to express wryness without saying a word. A bit fluffy, but can see my toes when I look down. Blonde, blue, and petite. Non-smoker, light social drinker, and I wear flip flops in the summer. 

Anyway, that's enough for now. So, if you're smart, can hold decent conversation, understand and appreciate pop culture, and know the cake is a lie, hit me up.

My family, friends, and my baby, Tino Bino (Boston Terrier) mean the world to me. I tell it like it is so it's an an acquired taste but the right person will come to appreciate my honest nature. 

Clubs and Bars aren't my thing but I love being a homebody or if I'm feeling adventurous I travel, go camping, shoot guns, and enjoy the outdoors. 

I'm a little overweight but I carry it well.

My name is Robin. I am 5'3"" and size 18. I have long brown hair and blue eyes. I am 47 years old with a 28 year old son that lives in California and a 12 year old daughter who lives with me. We moved to the Seattle area in August. I lived in California all my life and was ready to get out of there. So here I am and loving it.

Go for someone who makes you smile, because only a smile makes a dark day seem bright.

I enjoy baking, camping, walks, hikes, ocean, crafts, thrift stores, working in the yard, estate/garage sales, and will try most things my man enjoys. I have a great sense of humor and on the sarcastic side. I can go from painting the house to dressing up for dinner. I am a girl that will help you fix the car, repair the fence, or hell, might just start a home project myself. I have started refurbishing furniture since I moved up here. My daughter and I volunteer at the Food Bank and make military Thank You cards to put in care packages that go to our men and women serving our country. 

The happiest people don't necessarily have the best of every-thing...they just make the most out of everything that comes their way.

I am looking for my second half, my soulmate, my best friend, my lover and a life partner. Please be financially secure (car, place of his own and has a decent job). I enjoy men that are more outdoorsy and not afraid to get their hands dirty. I would like a man that can form a sentence correctly and can put a paragraph together. Definite plus if you give back to your community in some way. I don't smoke or do drugs of any kind and I am looking for the same. I drink about 4-6 times a year (just really not that good at it). I don't mind a social drinker, but not one that comes home and gets drunk 5 days a week. 

I am not looking for a FWB relationship. If I was, there are plenty of dick pictures to choose from. I am looking for something that will become a LTR. I am looking for MY Mr. Right. 
The best kind of friend is the one you can sit on a porch with, never saying a word and then walk away, feeling like that was the best conversation you've had. 

Please send me your picture and I will send mine. Please change the subject to >I am your man<.

Short sweet and to the point. 

I'm bored of watching Dare Devil on my own. I'm bored of sticking pretty much to just working and movies. I'm sick of people that flake on everything. I'm tired of people's drama. I'm not interested in people's games since I really don't understand the point. 

I'm 31. I work. I pay my bills on time. I'm a decent person but I have a pretty horrible sense of humor. I read comics. I watch bad movies and some good ones on occasion. I'm happier staying in watching movies with a beer than I am going out to some fancy place. I believe in people being who they are instead of trying to be anything else. I'm sure that's some sort of fatal character flaw, but it is what it is.

Me ~
I'm loyal, dedicated, honest, loving, forgiving, a great Mom, my dog loves me. I'm in medicine, so I'm a people person. I'm compassionate, a great listener. If you ask me something , expect me to tell it to you like it is.
I'm the marrying type ( Or I was. Maybe again one day) I would prefer not to be the girlfriend forever or dating forever type. I was raised to be the girl that raised a family and loved her husband. I believe in family dinners. I cook every night for my kids, clean my own house, do my own laundry. And I have a career.
But I also need adult time. I have a great sense of humor, I'm a bit of a smart a**. But I can take as much teasing as I give. The outdoors are a huge love for me. Hiking, Biking, Camping Skiing, Wine Country. Travel! Weekend road trips are a favorite.

My kids live with me full-time year round, I have 2 of them.There is no drama with my ex husband.


Who I'm interested in :o)
So here it is. I'm done with playing games. I know this seems harsh and direct. I just am at a point in my life where I want to be with someone that can handle their affairs. GET YOUR CRAP TOGETHER!! If you have a simple divorce and a couple of kids , Great! But leave the DRAMA LlAMA out to pasture and be ready to start something NEW. It's time to move on and let it go! Life is to short to waste!
Please make sure your kids are ok with you dating and that you don't have to sneak around to do so, or worry that if you ever introduce them to someone that they will hate them right off the bat , due to past hurts!

I have two wonderful kids from a previous marriage. They are the most important things in the world to me. So is my family.
So, I want someone in my life that I can do great fun things with. Who loves kids, dogs, an occasional gummy fruit flying from the back seat. Who likes weekend road trips, hiking, wine tasting, music, fun dates, bbq's with friends. Fishing is a new adventure for me, and I love it as do my boys. I would even be open to learning how to hunt!
So let's start with some honesty, be great at communication, you must love kids, dogs, traveling. Laughter and humor. Life is way to short to be serious all the time. Sometimes things happen, and seriously, you just have to laugh it off. Have a career, a passion, something you love to do. Be emotionally and financially stable. I'm ok with someone having kids, but I cannot have anymore.

I'm also ok with someone in the military.(Army, Marines or Air Force, Navy) Just please be stationed on JBLM or in the state of Washington. I understand deployments, and all that come along with it. ( Several emails have asked me that )

Not your typical ad , In reality been fishing for a guy and lately only catching seaweed. Life is too short to be alone and finding right guy is hard since most lie to you or break your heart. Might have been giving losers more attention than someone with a good heart that can overlook any flaws or mistakes I do. What I am looking for is simple and straight to the point. As for myself, instead of giving the typical ad with my likes dislikes, etc.. it's better to talk one on one via email. I may not be a thin,skinny, or anything that keeps a guy happy. but carry a huge heart and personality. Also not looking to hop in bed on first date. looking to build a trust and strength in a relationship before adding sex to the equation. I do believe in trying for an healthy relationship and willing to try.
Not interested in :
Liars
Cheaters,
Drugs,
drinkers
Couples
Shallow men

Interested in :
nice
fun

huge heart 
will be there when there are bad days and good days
Over 30

If you meet any of Requirements feel free to email me . Will not respond to one-liners or phone numbers. One last thing if we talked and not your type be honest , it wont hurt my feelings but it bothers me if quit responding and leaving me hanging. I am sure you dont like that but please give same respect thank you.

Since you have opened this posting I can only assume you are looking for yours as well. I love to walk along the water, fly kites, hike, go for drives, watch a good movie, go to the ocean, most of all going to Disneyland. However sadly these things are not fun when you do them by yourself. Does any of this sound like what you are looking for in someone? I want to find someone with a heart and who wants to be loved for who you are. While looks are important, I would rather see your heart and see if that is the person that is more like me. Looks, and weight can change in a heart beat while your heart is who you truly are. If this sounds like anything that you are looking for please write back and see if we could be the perfect match. Your picture will get mine. I'm not 420 friendly and if you are younger than 45 please don't try and talk to me. I'm not interested.

I was already flagged today not sure why.

If I'm not what you are looking for I wish you peace as you continue to look for your perfect match.
