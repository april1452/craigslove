Latina, 41 in search of my Super Nerdy (White) Hero

The things I would like out of this special friendship are, someone that I can connect with physically as well as intellectually. Someone I can have deep meaningful conversations to the lightest with! :) Someone to laugh and cry with. Share everything and anything, at full trust! Our secrets and only ours! Like special friends, soul mates... We can hangout, go out for lunch or dinner, have picnics, go for walks, hikes, travel/seek adventure, people watch, go to movies, or stay in, cook for each other, or together, teach me how to play videos games if you are a gamer?? =D haha. Put a flower in your head..or two! :) Be silly or cheesy together... cuddle, love each other. Simply just be together whenever we feel like, whenever life allows us to. I would like to find someone that I can care for and love, and in return do the the same for me. My heart is big and I would like to share it with someone special. It can be whatever we want it to be, as long as it is something meaningful.

I have been described by men as beautiful, cute, sexy, fun, funny, sweet and caring. To describe myself, I am caring, compassionate, passionate, hopeless romantic, sentimental, silly at times, but know when to be serious. I am a strong woman who can be vulnerable at times and I am not ashamed to say so. I have my flaws and I am very aware of them. They have helped me to learn and grow, better myself. They have made me the strong woman I am today, more and more each day. I am, simply put, a bubbly introvert.

I am attracted to younger men and they have always been attracted to me. We have always felt comfortable with each other, a special connection. I have been told I make them feel free, unleashed! And I too have always felt the same.

My preference is between the ages of mid 30's to early 40's. I am attracted to slender build (average, depending on what you define average as. Haha), shy, introverted (I find this trait rather sweet, cute, attractive!), white/Caucasian guys, fair skinned with light eyes. Green, blue... No tattoos (well actually...It depends. How big are we talking and how many??). I am sorry, but it's what I like, and I have a right to my preference. It is what it is! As you have a right to yours!

I have never seen a job take so long.

And the place sucks while it is being worked on (no pun intended).

I mean steamworks has really gone downhill, the guys there are not as good as it used to be, and it's just not fun.

I have been so disappointed the last few times I went with the renovation going on. Now the steam room is closed too; at lease it was OK to go in there even if the other areas were not as good as usual.

Do you have a secluded garden pool or even better pool and hot tub. that we could all nude sunbathe, skinny dip, and perhaps if the mood is right and strikes us have some hot sex. Perhaps you just enjoy watching and the company and friendship and perhaps if we're all attracted join in with us. We are open minded to same room (or outdoor pool area), soft or full swap and my gf is bi so girl on girl is possible and actually hoped for too. I am 5'11"" great shape white male and she is a sexy island/Asian. We can share (face & body) pics with you and we've posted just a few body pics here. If you have a pool and this sounds fun and interesting to you please write us back with your ideas or fantasies about this and hopefully an invitation for us. We like fun, laid back, non-pushy people. If you are 420 friendly and in the lifestyle we want to hear from you. We are open to if you have a community pool we can all hang at and then a condo or apartment where we can go and have fun and get naked too. Ideally we are looking for another couple or single lady but will also consider a guy too.

Going to EDC this year. Going for all 3 days. Looking for a travel and party buddy. Went to Beyond Wonderland in L.A. and it was a blast but the experience is so much better with company. Not sure if flying or driving. Road trips are so much fun, music, 420 and the open road. Maybe split the room cost. Let's have fun and become good friends, maybe if I'm lucky you'll be cute and we can make a LT connection.

Good afternoon happy Thursday !! If you like me and would enjoy having a friend to share things, thoughts, frustrations. Have some one to vent to about work family friends or just feeling down and need an ear or shoulder. Having a confidant, someone non judgemental. Talk about things you really can't or don't want to share with people you see on a daily basis or hurt someone's feeling. Add some fun excitement during the day just be yourself and not be who you need or have to be. Be silly and escape from everyday responsibilities we have to deal with day on day out. I'm hoping to develop a long term friendship with a lie minded person. Have someone I can confide and trust. 44 married Latino pretty easy going laid back. Witty, sincere, smart ass. Love to chat and have cool conversations during the day. I'm great at keeping secrets and able to share my own secrets with some one I trully trust

Sometimes it's good to just throw caution into the wind so to speak and have that good friend no one knows about. : ) if your up for it I would love to hear from you

Looking to build friendships with like-minded people. I reiterate: friendship only.

So, what's like-minded? My goal is to live a balanced life and enjoy my time here. I'm 36 (have been told I look much younger, yet act much older....sometimes....). Kind of a nonconformist, but totally accept the reality of social norms. A maker to the core and a perpetual student it would seem. Fun-loving as long as it's positive and uplifting. Pretty down to earth and casual. Introverted, but I love spending time with good people.

Love music, comedy, craft beer, $20 hamburgers (lol...), dives and holes in the wall, day trips, lectures, textiles, yarn, and cooking (every now and then). Interested in becoming healthier physically and spiritually (working on developing regular mediation/movement practice), spending more time out in nature, raising my consciousness in general.

I know that most people only browse CL for entertainment value...to see if anything can still shock their jaded sensibilities, but there are messages of genuine substance to be discovered...even here. 

I'm looking for the woman who is unhappily married but who needs to stay married for practical reasons. The woman who lacks intimacy in and out of the bedroom. What I don't want is lunch time sex. I want a woman that has the flexibility to experience life with me outside the bedroom as well. I want someone who I think about when I wake up in the morning and when I lay down at night. I want the woman who makes my heart sing when I hear her voice on my phone or get an email from her.. 

Making love is incredible when relationships are nurtured and emotional bonds are formed. I have no plans to leave the marriage that I'm in -- it's just too complicated -- but I'm not willing to live out the rest of my life unfulfilled either. 

There must be a woman who finds herself in a similar situation -- a woman who is ready to build a long-term, secondary relationship. 
Honestly, the concept of an affair seems quite easy. Two attached people make a decision to mess around and well the rest is history. However, the more complicated question is how do those two attached people make it known that they are open to such an arrangement.

About me: 

Others would typically describe me as being laid back, very funny, considerate, respectful, spontaneous and at time shy. I like sports , reading, beach/camping, independent and mainstream films, dancing, hiking, road trips, Cooking, Cricket and good restaurants ( who doesn't). But I would trade them all for a night of warmth and cuddling at home in front of a good movie and some great take out food... Care to join...(wink)


About you: 

The woman I am looking for married like me but is starved for intimacy and ready for a sensual and cerebral adventure. I am discerning and patient; this is only worth doing if it really feels right. She has darker hair and eyes...maybe olive complexion...she might be of Latin, Mediterranean, Asian, or mixed heritage. For that matter, she could be a striking brunette of any origin....the dark features are just my preference. She is fit and feminine. Her hands are soft and graceful...they fit nicely in my large grasp. 

Naturally none of us should be into games or one-nighters! If we are on the same page about what we want, send me an email -- possibly to explore this discreet, adventurous new friendship

I just got tested for the Meyers Briggs. I think the Meyers Briggs might be a bit out of date. Though if it is of any interest to you I'm ENTJ https://www.personalitypage.com/ENTJ.html
I associate myself from the lines of Vulcan from Star Trek.

When responding, I would appreciate if you can send a few info about you and what time you are able to meet me at the cafe. Thanks for being mindful of the time of agreement, as I will make reservations.

More info about me
• tea of choice: chai tea if it's available
• previous conventions attended: Developersfest, Pantheacon (I am not religious, I attended for the bellyjam) 
• previous food outing: French restaurant
• previous road trip: wine tasting / wine checking Healdsburg (I don't drink, I went w/ my honey)
• previous interesting food interaction: I shucked cacao beans
• previous game played: The Legend of Zelda
• previous shared thought: Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion.
• previous growth thought: developing my maturity: I apologized to valued friends, even though I was not in the wrong, there was proof. Valued friends are more important vs being adamant.

The Dowager Countess of Grantham from Downton Abbey says it best, ""If I withdrew my friendship from everyone who had spoken ill of me, my address book would be empty.""

This can be a 1 time meet up, and then we go our separate ways, or this could a few times meet up, or this could be a long term friendship. Either way I am glad you choose to spend a few hours with me at a tea hangout.

Namaste!

Looking to build friendships with like-minded women. I reiterate: friendship only.

So, what's like-minded? My goal is to live a balanced life and enjoy my time here. I'm single (well, widowed actually). I'm 36 (have been told I look much younger, yet act much older....sometimes....). Kind of a nonconformist, but totally accept the reality of social norms. A maker to the core and a perpetual student it would seem. Fun-loving as long as it's positive and uplifting. Pretty down to earth and casual. Introverted, but I love spending time with good people.

Love music, comedy, craft beer, $20 hamburgers (lol...), dives and holes in the wall, day trips, lectures, textiles, yarn, and cooking (every now and then). Interested in becoming healthier physically and spiritually (working on developing regular mediation/movement practice), spending more time out in nature, raising my consciousness in general. 

Drop me a line if you think we might be good partners in crime :)

A long time appreciator of good wine and friendly conversation I've attended this event many times and without doubt it's one of the best (second only to the Dry Creek Passport event that is). I'm a fun, open minded, knowledgeable guy who loves to laugh, chat, read, drive, sail, create, write, produce and much more and is committed to healthy living. In other words, I'm not going to get drunk but instead talk to wine makers, hang out with interesting people and see how the previous vintage wines are coming along.

I'm seeking a fun, witty, intelligent, trim, fit, young woman (late 20's - 30's) who may or may not have attended this event. The information about it can be found by doing a search for ""Sonoma County Barrel Tasting 2016"" You'll notice there are two weekends so I was thinking of a Sunday only on the second weekend

I'm single, fun, lots to talk about and willing to drive leaving from Marin. 

I have not purchased tickets yet and this is not an ad for sex, Sugar Daddy or anything similar. In other words you get your own ticket and we drive and have fun together. I know the territory very well and as Rain Man would say ""I'm an excellent driver"" too. 

I'm tall, fit, fun, smooth head, green eyes, trim, playful, intelligent and casual. This is about friendship and enjoying great wine in one of the most beautiful wine areas anywhere.

SPAMMERS: I will only respond to messages that say ""Barrel Tasting"" in the subject

A man named jed A poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed,

I used to watch the Beverly hillbillies reruns after school. life was good at home , but not at school where I was bullied and it wasn't a big deal like it is today.I remember my dad not liking me becuz I was fat, they divorced when I was in fourth grade My mom was super nice and I acted out and she didn't know why. I didn't tell her how miserable I was back then. Bless her heart. she is a great mom and I love her. I now take care of her since she has become handicapped and ill.
Im scared, I know she won't be with me for a long time. I hurt so much inside. I can't break down and show my weakness. I have to be strong for people that depend on me.
I already know I need to see someone , Im not looking for that answer,I do get exercise, I used to be a buffed guy 3 years ago, but no gym for me right now. can't take on any bills at all, having someone to talk with would be nice. I don't have many friends anymore. Guess Im just lame . I no longer have a lust for life do to all the financial crisis I am in. they say misery loves company. does anyone relate ? or I am a lost cause? I don't care if I get rude answers or spam. its easy to delete and go to the next.
I am in a reality of my own doing. I think its stupid to profess your a real person .even spam and scams are written by real people. ugh..
is anyone there? hello? can you hear me?
I don't think I am fat slob, but I can tell people are not as nice or friendly because of the extra lbs I have, I get told I look mean or look like a cop. I'm withdrawn and numb. not mean or violent. 
a distraction from my world is what I seek.

Its been awhile since I have attempted to make new friends. Somewhere along the line I have lost contact with my core friends. life happens. 
I would say there so many good reasons to establish a friendship, As we all do. I used to be so sure of what I wanted and a good judge of people. 
I work on a computer all day and since I'm self employed I can make time to check in and see how your day is or whatever topic we are on. 
Now for that gray area..if your definitely set on never ever meeting , Sharing a real pic or having a drink together at some point, we are not a match. 
just think it would be cool to have someone to talk with at the very least. Life has taken a couple unexpected turns on me. dealing with it and wondering how other people make it. 
I go to bed late , can chat or read you a bedtime story.. I am legit. Why would someone put up a platonic ad and be deceptive? well send me a message and let me know whats on your mind?

I've recently had the inclination to make a new friend. A homegirl, a super rad lady friend, a straight up doll. Someone new and interesting who is capable of knocking my socks off with their awesomeness. I'm in a relationship and my ideal friend would be too.
Some affectionate ball busting and joke cracking would be our primary deal... with maybe a little flirting if the chemistry is right.

I'm extremely picky. I value individually, creativity, hard work and a stellar comedic witt. A huge plus if you walk the line between creative bohemian and jock. Any age from 20 to 30 works for me. Well that's it for now I suppose. Hope to hear from you soon, pretty lady.

Ah yes. I can see it now -- the flow of email messages into my Inbox (cowardly masked by CL of course) telling me I am a fool. Or too wordy. Or misguided. 

But I am going to write this post and ignore the naysayers and cynics. Of course they exist in this cesspool. But relationships are all the more valuable, more meaningful and loved when one chances upon a diamond in the rough when rowing in the cesspool.

ISO a kind, attentive, romantic and adventurous woman who wants to start as friends and then move on to something more meaningful as if we are simpatico. I respect my own time so very assiduously, and hope that you are much the same. For it would mean that you are perceptive, worldly, empathetic and can hold your own without being judgmental of others. That's a rare bird.

But I have a thing for rare birds. Write and tell me your tale.

If anyone asks I'll deny it, because, you know, I am a guy and all. But I'm a wee bit lonely. And discouraged. Which makes me the guy for you! Actually, this IS in the ""strictly platonic"" category, and if I know anything about Craigslist, it's that everyone here adheres to the designated categories. So I'm not looking, per se, merely casually, slyly perusing under the universal safe word ""platonic."" Or maybe I'm not doing that at all. Maybe I'm a hapless wonder who can recite every line from ""Princess Bride"" and really think the Bay area is everything wonderful and beautiful.

If you're still reading, congratulations on being literate (I'm all about positive reinforcement ;) ). If you're entertained, you're welcome. 

I used to think I was the eternal optimist. It turns out, the longer I'm in this place in life, the shorter eternity gets.

Hello. I guess I should qualify the title to this post. I need help relocating ( this is for someone who is getting prepared for eternity, and would relocate if it would help) to Woodland Park, near Colorado Springs, CO., to live and travel on the Gospel Truth Rd. that leads to Charis Bible College and a community of believers who are awesome. I am 56 years old now, and moved to Santa Rosa for a reason that is past for a long time now and I need to move on. If I have to go alone, I will, but prefer to go with someone, as I am tired doing life by myself, although I do have a little dog named Buddy. My plan is to go in the Spring, or to just start preparing. Maybe you know of a friend or family member who would be into this? I have plenty of references, and a 2004 Toyota Corolla to get us there. And some money saved to relocate with. I am going knowing that I will receive healing there, as they have a big healing ministry you can watch live every Thursday at 12:00 our time live streaming at www.awmi.net You can check it out if you are not already familiar with Andrew Wommack ministries. Just go to Events, which will bring up a menu then click on LIVE then just watch. If must get healed, or else. The time comes when it gets down to the wire, and even if these are not the last days for the world, its my last days ( and yours) and I don't want to wonder where I will spend eternity, because we are all leaving in a wood box, or by fire. Please, Lord, let someone else be of the same mind. God Bless you. By the way, I am an ex Deadhead from living in Santa Cruz in 1979-80 just to let you know I am not a christian born into a pastor's family, but got saved in spite of the family into which I was born. But when I or we leave, I am throwing away all my Grateful Dead tapes ( I only have one anymore), and beginning fresh. I was saved in Australia in 1982, but backslid when I went to college, so I am a prodigal son on his way home from living feeding the pigs. Thanks for reading this. Have a great day! Sincerely, Gene

Why not?

And yes, we are and should both married or attached...but in need and search of more since we cant really change our current situations.... I guess we have already this in common if you are still reading this ad.

I'm not alone I bet... Life is way too short to keep losing time as we are getting older everyday...

I am hoping to find a nice and sincere woman... a wise woman...attractive too...

We can find ourselves in situations that seemingly have no end. My wife has become more of a roommate than anything else. Circumstances that I will not go into here prevent me from leaving. Been together for a long time and now we just pass each other in the night. There are stupid arguments, stupid fights, no ugly but dormant. 

I am looking for a confident, friends with benefits, or anything with passion. I want companionship, friendship, communication, mutual respect, trust and caring. I'm looking for someone, preferably married, who may be in a similar situation and looking for a little something more in their life. Let's be each others friend, companion, confidant and possibly lovers if it goes that far. Communication is key with me. I like to exchange cute emails and chats during the day. It's simply a lot of fun because I'm a also romantic at heart. I'm not looking to be your new husband nor am I looking for you to be my new wife. When we can, we'll steal moments away with each other.

I'm an educated hard working professional, funny, discreet, humorous, caring, polite, respectful, laid back person that knows how to treat a lady as a lady. I'm a romantic and caring person. I like to engage in funny give and take conversations with a bit of humorous bantering. I'm a passionate person who is missing much of that now in my life. I would like to meet and be with a special friend on many levels; intellectually, compassionately, as good friends that share and confide in each other and also passionately. I'm a good listener and very sensitive to the moods and needs of those close to me. Affectionate and caring. I keep my self in decent shape. If everything works out fine it will blossom into a nice romance.

Please be between the ages of 35-50, live in the Bay Area, easy going (with a sexy personality), decent shape as I am too. I am mostly open to most nationalities as long as they are respectful however I'm most attracted to Caucasian even thought I'm not.

Hi,

I'm a married man, not looking for anything physical rather, I'm looking for a woman, that would like to have conversations. Conversations about marriage roles, and whether or not I'm wrong in my thinking of how me, as a husband should be treated by his wife and vice versa. I consider myself a great provider, husband, partner, and father, yet, I feel that I don't get treated as such in some situations. Would love the point of view of a woman (who is blunt and honest), about how she would react if put in the situation of being my wife. 

This is not only a one sided conversation. I would be glad to play the other role and offer up advice as well, or if you just want to have someone to chat with, that's cool too. All and all, I would like this to be a fun and laid back experience that we both benefit from. Let's chat via, google hangouts or some other means of instant messaging. If you would like to exchange FB info or something similar, we can lead up to it.

The principles of Tantra are fundamental for a healthy, mature approach to life, and the things you will learn about yourself and your approach to intimacy will empower you to change your life for the better. Our goal is to learn, understand and experience following:

- Live authentically and true to our self 
- Live healthy and attract quality people
- Enhance self awareness
- Develop sensual sensitivity
- Manage and Heal from past trauma and abuse. Overcome internal blocks
- Retain sexual energy, channel it to pervade all areas of your life and move to higher state of consciousness

I have some experience with the practice, interested in enhancing experiences and enjoy the host of benefits for our overall well-being. I'd be interested in a partner who is patient and eager to learn about this practice. I'm clean, very respectful, and spiritual.

I'm looking for partners to practice the art of Tantra. It's the art of connection and patience that involves trust building, yoga, touching, massage and mutual gazing.

I have no idea if this will work, but here goes nothing :-) I am a single mid-30s female and I am expecting a baby in the next year. Many of my friends are without kids or the ones who have them are far away. I am a straight woman, just looking to meet other moms in hopes that we can hang out with our kids on fun outings and help each other out when needed. It doesn't matter to me if you're single or in a relationship. Prefer someone relatively close by (anywhere in the east bay is great) and with young kids. I am hoping to build a nice community of mothers where we know each other and our kids grow up together. If this appeals to you, hit me up :) Thanks and have a great day!

I have 2-tickets (good seats-1st balcony). The friend I was going with, got a better offer. So, I need someone to take their place. I know it is last minute, so I am not selling the ticket and no strings would be attached (like the ad says, strictly platonic).

You can go with me for free (I 'may' want 1-drink, though). The concert starts at 730pm and will end around 10pm. You would be free to leave at any time (if you really can't stand to be with me after we meet?).

I can tell you I am 60-years old, white/bald, 5'9"" tall and 190lbs. I love music of all kinds and I'm an overall good-guy. You must be female (any age, preferably close to mine?). I don't care about your ethnic background, as long as you love music (preferably R&R because 'Satch' plays predominately R&R).

Get back to me as soon as possible. I will choose based on my gut feelings about you, so give me some feedback. Thanking all, in advance.

Really not looking for anything sexual, just friends who like to hang out, do activities, even go to places nude.

How come most of the nudists are of a certain age and certain body type? Are there any guys my age (40's) or even younger (30's/20's) who like/want to explore nudism?

Decent looking, Filipino guy here, easy going, carefree, go to the gym, have an average body, but that shouldn't be a hang up when you're just hanging out right?

Enough of that I will get into more detail when we talk. Anyway I want a woman to be a good listener and be a best friend for me. We can talk on the phone and see each other as friends to a social drink or a place when we both are available I would like to meet and talk to a married woman that is also in a same relationship/marriage as me. I am a good listener and also I try to make things right on whatever your going thru I am a sweetheart that has a heart and that has alot of respect to woman trust me you will get to know me on how I really am, I am no creep nor am I wierd. I have a good career and we can get into details when we talk.

Honestly I want out of this marriage and I will tell you why when we talk. I want a good a friend to start things off slow. I even want a woman to guide me on how to cope with what I am going thru. Honestly I am a good guy and I will show you that I promise. Message me friend :-)

I am an asian/white female, early 30's, live a pretty open minded lifestyle and bisexual. I would prefer to make friends with someone who understands that part of me without feeling judged. I'm not interested in making any new friends with girls who are attached or married because unfortunately all of my current friends started being homebodies because of their significant others. I'm sure there are girls who are the exception but I prefer to make single friends for now. I'm 420 friendly, very fit and environmentally conscious, an artist and musician, dancer, lover, giver, and most importantly open minded. If you can relate, write me back and let's play it by ear. I enjoy being kind to strangers and hopefully this will be the start to a great friendship.

The best friendship I ever had was with a married woman. She was not getting support in her marriage. Of course we didn't see each other as often as we would have liked, but its not the quantity of time that's important, what's important is the quality of time. 

I want a connection again. I'm looking to form a connection. We feel a connection whether we are sharing happy things in our lives or sad things. I am a good listener and all ears :)

A little about me. I'm 35, hwp. I have a very positive outlook on life and I'm an eternal optimist. I believe that everyone needs fulfillment of the heart and we are meant to have a connection with someone.

Let's chat, get to know each other and see how things go.

Hi! This is what platonic means:

Etymology
Variant of Platonic, which see. The sense ""non-sexual"" dates to the 17th century in English, and to the 15th century in Latin; see platonic love for details.

Pronunciation
(UK) IPA(key): /pləˈtɒnɪk/
(US) IPA(key): /pləˈtɔnɪk/
Adjective
platonic ‎(comparative more platonic, superlative most platonic)

Not sexual in nature; being or exhibiting platonic love.
They are good friends, but their relationship is strictly platonic.
Alternative letter-case form of Platonic (of or relating to the philosophical views of Plato and his successors).

If you can't figure that out, please stop reading!

I am HAPPILY MARRIED

I am UGLY and FAT!

I am a pedestrian. (I don't drive, which makes me a burden on society, of course.)

I enjoy classic board games, card games, story telling, and vintage entertainment.

(Might as well get all the boring stuff explained.)

you're more simple than complex
aren't too into material things
can laugh
can talk
can cry


i'm from the midwest. i'm almost 6 feet tall. basketball is my favorite sport to watch, golf my favorite to play. i'm very random, will say the most random things and am pretty outgoing. or i can just be chill. it all depends on the situation. i like hiking a lot too. or just sitting and talking....or listening because i know that the majority of females like to talk. 
so if any females out there find this appealing and want a good guy friend, hit me back and we can start chatting!

Winter is here and it's time to go exploring. I have a good amount of friends, my problem is they are mostly men, and i'd like to change that. The few female friends i do have are married/have kids/moved far away. It is time for me to meet a new great friend to have on my side. As for me i'm single, no kids and have a flexible schedule so i can get up and have fun at a moments notice. I'm fun, sarcastic, laid back but outgoing, social and easy to get along with (yup, all the cliches). I'm looking for more than just an ""acquaintance"" or ""party friend."" I'd like a close friend that is as fun and laid back as me. Some things i love: reading, cooking (i tend to make my friends gain a few pounds, i apologize in advance), dancing all night followed up by some late night Denny's, concerts, festivals, plays, workout, hike. I BBQ on almost a weekly basis with friends and every Sunday when The Walking Dead is on I have a Walking Dead get together which consists of pizza, alcohol, Walking Dead discussion followed up by a trip to the bar after the show. I also used to do that for True Blood, but the season is over. Anyway, i'm ready to get this party started! Email me if you feel we will click and you can get out more than ""Once in awhile."" I'm not looking for someone ""casual."" More a friend that i can rely on, and that can rely on me for anything and also to have some fun and amazing nights out with. I'm checking out a bar in my area tonight. Maybe you can come??!! All i ask is that you be as fun and laid back as me, and please be mobile.
Gay men are welcomed to email me!

So honestly how is your marriage, ever think it is not what you thought it would be? I have been pondering that question a lot and, I just don't seem to understand things. I believe in communications and being honest, and truthful. Do you ever feel that you husband or partner is not really their for you and does not really understand you or is listening to you. I am not trying to bash anybody, but I do believe that marriage is an equally partnership, and we must always be open. I am just looking to talk to others that feel the someway. Looking to find friends and people that relate to what I am thinking. I am Asian male and actually we can talk about anything this was just a thought.

I am not perfect, and don't have the body or muscles like a god not handsome, but short and a little chubby. Yes I am a nerd glasses and all, but never did well in school.

Hi, I am a married man and I am looking for a woman who would like to write with me on occasion. 

Sometimes it is just nice to get a different POV from someone of the opposite gender other than a spouse.

We can write about jobs, family, fun activities, whatever.

I would prefer that we share at least some commonalities. I am college educated, a professional, in my early fifties. I have traveled extensively and I keep up to date on most current events.

Please do not respond if you don't know the difference between your and you're; their, there, and they're. You get what I'm mean.

Why don't we just start with an introduction. Tell me why you chose my post to reply to,what you are looking for and a little about yourself.

Thank you.

I am a husband and father who enjoys receiving massage. I admire and value the sacred space created by practitioners, to heal the body and quiet the mind. Bodywork has proven integral to my well being, as both a pleasant and practical form of facilitated meditation.

But a massage isn't something I can afford to have often. So, instead of paying to feel this way, I'd rather massage others for free. Performing bodywork lets me repay the patience, generosity, and attention that I received on the table. Moreover, I gain a very different sense of myself, which is truly a gift all its own.

My offer is simple, straight forward, and easy to attain: have a body that you want massaged. We'll coordinate schedules, then meet once, or regularly. My intention is to heal, connect with, and relieve your physical body.

I am a professional Black male, in my late thirties, of average weight and height. My personality type (ENTP) emphasizes thinking over feeling, which explains this lengthy post and my pursuit of sensate connections. My wife understands me best of course, and is my rock in this endeavor. She recognizes my need to be used, tasked, and encouraged by women. Through this ad, she is allowing you to do just that.

I've offered my time and attention via Craigslist in the past, and may provide references - if not, testimonials. I'm available for 1 to 3 hour sessions, most evenings, weekends, and Fridays. You can visit my modest Berkeley studio, or I can travel to you, within 30 minutes of Lake Merritt. I own a portable table, use draping, and have been privileged to work with various body types, abilities and conditions.

Please note that I am merely a student of touch, with no formal training. If you have any relevant ailments or medically diagnosed concerns, you are strongly advised to inform me. I can research and prepare, but ultimately trust that you know your health best. Above all else, I encourage feedback, and will dutifully adjust my stroke for your comfort.

My style is an intuitive mix of Swedish, Esalen, Lomi Lomi, and Thai stretches. I'm also familiar with the sacrum, psoas, glutes, adductors, and some lymph systems. You're welcome to inquire about your preferred modality as well - learning them expands my capacity to serve. Whatever the request or preference, I aim to deliver what you need to relax.

I welcome all inquiries. The most common one asks why I do this for free. While there is no fee, your presence and attention are invaluable. Caring for others helps me focus, open up emotionally, and simply be grateful. Giving is a chance to be present, which allows me to see my own patterns and solve my own problems, more easily. Not only is money a hurdle to having these moments, it often diminishes their value.

I hope to have written enough that you might respond with the same confidence, good faith and gratitude that I've attempted to display. Should you reply, please include a reasonable introduction, and what you can about your unique massage goals, needs, and/or concerns. Simply include your photo if you would like mine, in kind. Otherwise, expect to voice verify or meet and greet before booking. Finally, title your response ""somatic healing"", so I might weed out spam.

Thank you for reading all of this through. Be well!

If you're not looking for a hook up than post in strictly platonic, right? Is posting a pic to let you know I have all my teeth a good or bad thing? If I'm not interested should I not respond even tho I feel as if that's rude? Just need some guidance I guess

I know this is a long shot but it is craigslist so you never know. I am planning on taking some time off work next week (Tues through Thurs) . I just want to go do something fun and would love some company. I am posting this on SP because it doesn't have to involve sex. I just like to talk and chat and maybe go to dinner etc.

So this is what I was thinking, I got my convertible ready and gas'd up!

Option 1 :

Reno - I got free rooms at Eldarado, we can get 2 beds, 

Option 2:
Coastal Drive - Maybe go near Hertz Castle?

I am open to other ideas too. If you are interested, please send me your stats and I will send you mine. We can meet first for coffee to make sure that we are comfortable with each other.

I don't care if you are married or not, young or old, just as long as you can let loose and have some fun.

What do ya think?

You would think the spouse is the one who will help you get through these years of questioning, career changes, being a parent, or just trying to make sense of your place in the world. But sometimes that's not the case. Conversations with your lover can just go in circles, be mundane, turn into arguments, lead to more frustration, and just leave you with more questions than answers. So I'm looking for another female friend, to talk with, walk with, meet and smile and laugh about the situations we find ourselves in, whether you're attached or single. No one has to know about us, it'll just be you and me making a connection and staying in touch, because I'm not really connected with all the people I used to know and everyone's gone their separate ways. I've made very few new friends, mostly coworkers, and some stay in touch and some don't. Hopefully you're local to San Jose and staying around for the long term. I really need a consistent friend, and I'm not anticipating anything romantic, although you never know what may happen and where life might find us a few years down the road. So if you feel what I'm feeling in you're close to my age, and think you can relate, let me know.

I'm twenty eight, no kids, never married I like to play sports, listen to music, watch movies etc. . . Despite how I write I'm a really silly guy and don't try to take too many things too seriously because of this, plus life's short. I live in Vallejo, but that doesn't mean the woman for me has to be here as well. I don't think the woman for me has to be within a 5-mile radius and it's pretty narrow-minded to think so. I'm looking for a woman who is willing to hang out frequently, I understand not everyone would be and that's find just disregard this whole ad if this isn't you. If it is then keep reading. As far as the kind of women I like I like sweet women who have an innocent side but also a flirtatious one when need be, someone clean of course, faithful, loyal and not a liar. I'm not into married women or women who are still living with their ex or who sleep around a lot. Also if you currently have any friends with benefits I'm not interested. Physically I like a thick woman who has a very large/'huge butt, a lot of women think they do, (or try to give the illusion they do by standing sideways or sitting on a sink), but I've noticed they don't, at least not to my standard. I'm all black; I tend not to care about race too much though.

I don't think what I am asking for in a woman friend is that much but maybe it is when it comes to women nowadays because it seems like women nowadays always gotta have sex in their lives somewhere. Why is it a bad thing that I am not looking for sex? Shouldn't women be glad to find a man who doesn't want to have sex with them but actually wants to get to know them and be in their company? I know what you might be thinking but I am by no means gay I just don't have the desire for sex but I do have the desire for friendship and companionship. I don't know if it is too much to ask but it seems like but all I am looking for is a good friend who has time to spend with me doing fun and memorable things (ex: bowling, shooting pool, dancing, looking at the stars, movies, etc). I hopefully would like to meet a woman who would be my best friend, somebody who I can talk mess to but know its all for fun and not serious. Somebody who won't just disappear on me if something tragic happens in their life and know it's better to have a good friend at those times than to be alone. Also what would be great but not required is to have a friend who is kind of on the thicker side and I don't mean by women standards but by men standards and trust me those are two different standards. I say that because I would like a friend who is ok with some flirting being allowed in our friendship without you developing sexual urges because I found out most women can't.

A little about me I reside in Valleo I am 28 I am 6'2 black stocky build brown skin brown eyes full lips deep voice facial hair, I drive, I work, no kids, don't smoke, or drink, or do drugs.

You are open-minded, intelligent, active, humorous and honest.
You know how to laugh at yourself and are naturally playful.
You welcome the depth of a philosophical discussion while also embracing silly banter.
Your mind works quickly, and you are sure of who you are and what you want.

To me, your race, age, or physicality is not important. Your self-confidence is.

I am fit because I thrive on being active. I'd like to find someone who enjoys hiking or road cycling, because eventually we might want to do things together. I find that women bring a unique perspective, and I appreciate that.

It would be great to go to the movies, take scenic walks, dine out and just be spontaneous with someone who's open to living life without holding back. Ultimately I do want to meet ""the one"" and hey, if that happens here even better but that isn't at all what I'm expecting. 

I've only had one sb/sd relationship in my life and that lasted almost five years. It was mutually rewarding but like all good things it peacefully ended. As you can see I'm looking again for someone who equally loves adventure but can mix it in with a sexual arrangement. I love trying new things and it doesn't have to be all about sex but I do want that as part of the agreement. I'm sure you appreciate straightforwardness. 

I love a girl who can still wear heels when we stand next to each other. Don't count yourself out if you're petite :) I'm over 6ft, cute, tall and considered a handsome man. I'm disease free and will always try to make time for someone who's good in bed and a great friend. I'm looking for someone cute with a great personality, brain, and sense of humor! I'm looking for a long term friend with benefits, not just a one time, nsa thing. A weekly stipend is what I was thinking and I'm good for it.

If this is what you're looking for please share what your expectations for a stipend type of arrangement would be like? How many times a week do you think realistically you could meet up? Are you single? Is your place available some of the time or would we always have to come to my place? When you write feel free to ask me any questions you may have. Please tell me a bit about yourself as well as send some good pictures. I will be happy to answer anything and send pictures of myself.

When an attractive guy has an education and a good job, people ask why is he still single this late in the game? Girls ask specifically, ""What's wrong with him?"" I'll be perfectly honest. I've had back to back long term traditional relationships before having an arrangement and this is something that just works for me right now. I plan on settling down one day but the problem right now is that I work and travel a lot. 

I really, really like my job, and unfortunately it requires me to go places on short-notice. I do a lot of driving all over California and along the West. My schedule gets in the way of dating and this situation works perfectly for a student or someone who has equal needs. I don't think it would be an issue if I had a long-term girlfriend, but it's a big problem when you're trying to get past the first few dates just getting to know each other and the girl discovers that my schedule is just all over the map.

The girl I'm looking for is anywhere between 5'2''-5'9'' with blonde, brunette or red hair. She has blue, green or hazel eyes and is slim and takes care of herself. I'm open to HWP as long as you take care of yourself and stay healthy and active. I love a girly girl but also a girl who doesn't mind getting her hands dirty. I'm open to different ethnic groups. :) 

With all of this said, are you that someone who's open to a friend's-with-benefits scenario while being compensated for it? I'm pretty sexual and frankly it's difficult to find somebody who can accommodate my schedule. I think if we didn't expect a big emotional commitment from each other then maybe it would be simpler. I'm not really interested in being a ""player."" No games. To be honest, I'm not opposed if we do end up developing feelings for each other but that's down the road. Who knows what could happen....

We play at Twin Creeks in Sunnyvale on Thursday nights on a gay league. You definitely do not have to be gay.....it's about 50% straight...BUT...you have to be gay friendly. 

It's a really fun league with a great group of players. Our team is looking for a few players (men or woman) to join us for the Spring League which starts April 7th. Games range from 6:40pm to 9pm. They are 55 minutes long.

We are a C-team which means that you must have played baseball and/or softball before and have some experience. This is slowpitch softball. We play to have fun and of course compete;)

Let me know if you might be interested and can commit to Thursday night games at Twin Creeks in Sunnyvale. Summer league is $135. There are no gate fees.

If interested send me an email with a little information/background.

Hello!

I am brand new to the area and with that, I have no friends to go out with and explore. 

Little about me... I am 25, tall, laid back, employed and educated. I am seeking friends to explore and enjoy the night life with.

I just moved to Cotati for work and school. I typically like to go out once or twice during a weekend and have a few drinks while watching or listening to some good music.

If this interested you at all, hit me up. I dont bite and im really laid back.

It would be nice to find a reliable male buddy to meet occasionally for moderate exsercise (hiking, biking, running). Ideally, you are around my age and available some weekday mornings and Sundays. You don't have to be a super athlete, just a positive attitude.

I also am up for adventure and am curious about everything in nature. Last night I found awesome flourescent minerals in the streambed at Bishop Ranch. I have a portable blacklight and thought it would be cool to see if there were any in the streambed. Surprisingly found several and some very fluorescent.

I am working in California extended and have a family back home, so you are safe. I'm not a predator, but am a protector. I've done many interesting things in life and have also had my share of hardships.

I am a desi working male in south bay....

I am looking for a very specific indian lady for friendship. If you are bored from your daily grind and mundane working life and need a new desi male for good conversation and friendship with new experiences and a different twist, I would be the person you would be friends with.

If you are looking for a friendship, which is based on ""barter"" system, then please consider me. I would be very much willing to get you a dress or two from a store (if you are running short of chash), or get you lingerie or panties/bra from Victoria Secret or similar store. You are willing to consider a fun friendship. 

What am I seeking? Well, not exactly what you think, but close to.

How about trading cooking recipes with me? How about cooking me a sample of any famous or favorite dish that you are good at cooking? May be I can learn few things. I am reasonably good at cooking, but always looking for new cuisine. May be Indian, may be non-Indian. can you barter this kind of trade with me? If you want to make it slightly more fun, then you might consider some non-sexual kind of fun too!

See thing is, I'm attached and will need to stay alone for few months while spouse is out of country and looking for a very fun way to get to know a new woman and make friends with!

We can talk about different bartering scenarios if you wish.
After all the ""Benefit"" in ""Friends with benefit"" always comes with some kind of trade offs.

Hence, clothes for cooking, or clothes for mild-fun, or clothes for some other kind of benefit, would be good!

Or how about clothes for massage?
Or cooking for massage?
(I give great full body massage!)....

I'm a handsome desi man, good looking, fit and trim, in good shape and take good care of myself!

Regards

So.. Here's the situation: I'm a dude lookin for some new friends. Thing is, I've never had a problem makin friends with other guys. Girls though, that's a different story. It may be possible that I've just been introduced to the wrong ones. THOSE ""friends"" normally just wanted to hang out during parties, drink all my liquor and then they'd disappear till the next party. And they'd normally want a free ride to and from the party. Not down for that. I mean, don't get me wrong, I definitely wouldn't mind having a friend that I can drink with, in fact, I enjoy drinkin with my friends, but I'm looking for friends I can also kick it with when we're NOT drinkin.

About me: Half Hispanic, half Filipino, I like movies, tv, music, art, video games, beer, hanging out, drivin, among other things.

You: Be awesome, like similar things, be around my age like somewhere around 20-30, live near my area.

Fun Fact: If you're a Legend of Zelda fan, we might be besties. If you dislike Legend of Zelda, we might be mortal enemies.

Anywayz, if you're lookin for a new friend, I'm here. Send me an email if you're interested. If you wanna just text first that's cool with me, but I would like to kick it eventually. I'd write more about myself, but I feel that's something that we could talk about when we kick it. Also, I didn't post a pic cause this is Craigslist and I think it's weird, but I'll send one if you want, and I'd want one in return. I mean, I would like to place a face to the person I'm talkin to.

Or Kik me: S_Flame

Hope to hear from you soon!

These are my general interests: literature, personal growth/liberation, over-nite trips, animals, orchids, theatre, exotic/natural cuisine, nature (sun/surf, nude sunbathing) and its wild critters, estate sales, the Enneagram, robust humor, sex, and retreats.

Also: healthful life-style, chemical sensitivities, pre-'80s USA films, foreign cinema (view 2-3 flix nightly), Caribbean/European people, creative sex (I stretch backwards & you ingurgitate my jewels). Amenable 2 any activity that's focused on the front side of our bodies, massage (have table), self-disclosing conversation, swimming, ""making out"" by candle glow, helping you bake exquisite viands, that'll feed us after the shooot'ng subsides.

I like antiques: arbors, elder doggies, grand dads, gifted divas, architecture, the seas, values/sentiments. The Pyrenees is my birth place, educated in Florida.

Desirous of a serious, meaningful, and ""old-fashion"" relationship---not with a gelid intellectual. My personality/character make me significantly different from others in the Bay Area.

I want to be read to, in bed, do you? I've never owned a tv set---their voices ire me. Use no tobacco, dumbbells, or petrol-riddled fragrance. Marijuana, si Senorito. Trendiness passes me by.

If your response is too short, bromidic, or dumb, it'll be appropriately tossed. I hope this plan works well for you: We exchange 2-3 emales, I submit my phone #, you call, I reveal my precise address. If you are my type, you won't be pusillanimous about phoning. Let us simplify this tender rendezvous, eh? We meet at my hacienda...not at a cacophonous, players' cafe' that sells transparent cafe' with ersatz cream.

When we get better acquainted, & b4 we meet, I'll send my photo. I prefer men who are light-complexioned & hairy. However, this posting is about imminent friendship, & so your surface is not important to me unless it's unclean & emits vapors. Who knows who Mrs. Taggart is? Win a prize if you guess correctly. I assure you that I'll be flagged for not being conventional.

I'm going to be straight up here with who I am and what I am looking for and not looking for. First of all, not ""looking"" for sex or to change my situation. As for sex, though I am not looking, I may not be opposed to it either. Anyway, what I am looking for is a friendship, someone to get to know. Email, text, flirt, share the days events, etc etc, coffee dates, whatever.....easy going, simple and real. I'm a hard working active and fit gentleman, easy going with a sense of humor and wit. Distract me please. ...lol, you know, the daily grind and responsibilities.

Hi there! 
I am an attractive male looking for female dance partners. I love to dance which seems to be a bit out of the norm for a guy to be the one needing it. I truly love to feel the music flow throuh my body and express it the best way I know how....... and I don't mean straight up aggressive bump and grind pelvic thrusts although there is a time and a place for that. Lol. 

I am a soulful, classy, fun, sexy, energetic, smoooooooooth, and controlled dancer. By all means I am not a professional dancer... but professional dancers are whom I'd likely vibe with the best. Hopefully that doesn't scare too many off... I just have good rhythm and soul and want to share it with someone who gets it too.

If interested in a super fun night out on the town full of no pressure, no expectation dancing... again all about the dancing.... lets connect! 

Im 32, Caucasian, attractive, fit/ toned, tattoos, respectful of boundaries, respectful of space, can take a hint, can make us both feel sexy out there... 

Will love to dance to anything and everything but likes reggae, soul, funk, blues, rnb, hip hop, top 40, electronic..... anything soulful. :)

Please tell me a bit about yourself, when you want to get out, and maybe a photo? I'll return the favor. :)

I'm a 31 year old (single, white, if that matters) guy who lives a busy (work)life. I'm a heavy set guy (284lbs, 6'1"") and I have been gaining weight a lot lately due to inactivity and unhealthy eating habits. I live in the city and I work in tech industry as a software engineer. I really love my job and that kinda makes me a bit of a workaholic. I don't have much of a life outside of work which often manifests as me staying at the office at late hours. When I'm not working I like to read books(mostly sci-fi), watch tv shows, go to movies, play xbox, catch up on science and technology. When I manage to take time off from work, I really like going for walks around the city and hike the coastal trails.

I'm looking for someone who is in a similar life situation. Basically if any of the following applies:
- busy life and struggles to keep weight down
- makes excuses for not exercising
- really want to get healthy but need a push and someone to motivate you
- are already healthy and/or fit, but would like someone to work on and motivate

I don't care if you're married, in a relationship or single. I would really like to stress that I am not looking for a romantic relationship of any kind and I am not hoping this to develop into anything more than a friendship. No ""casual"" encounters or anything like that. One thing I do ask is that if you are in a relationship or in a marriage and your partner tends to be jealous kind, I'd ask you to skip this ad. I am all about no drama, and I do not want to spend time making excuses or doing things in secret because of your partner.

What I am looking for is an activity partner for walking, hiking, gym and/or just exploring the city. Basically I would like to find someone I could make plans with to go for walks and have an excuse to not stay at work so late. :)

Just send me a mail and we can get to know each other a little better and go for a coffee or something. I'm not a creep and I'd also like to verify that you're not one, so meeting in a public place first would be ideal.

While I find self-identifications like ""intellectual"" to be smug, pretentious and mostly ill-fitting for someone like me, it nonetheless seemed like a catchy subject title that might attract a less perverted, more refined cross-section of people. 

Having briefly perused the personals on here on both the mens' and womens' sides, I am not writing this post with a wide-eyed hope for a multitude of promising responses. But I do hope that among the numerous responses I will receive from the multitudes of swine (who will no doubt attach gratuitous genitalia pictures,) and from hostile misanthropic jerks with a penchant for writing scathing insults, that a few pearls might emerge. What constitutes a pearl among swine? I am not sure. If I am pearl myself, I certainly feel lackluster.

So about me...I am a university student in my twenties, and I suffer from a chronic depression with some rather debilitating stripes. I do not have any problems identifying the indispensable good and positive growth that has come out of my experience with academia, but the bad (the elitism, the enormously sensitive egos of some academics, the condescension, the competition, the demoralizing criticism, and the sometimes poor regard for ethical, fair treatment), has left me disillusioned. I sometimes wonder if I will continue onto graduate school or not. At this point, I have far from realized career ambitions that I entertain with fluctuating hope. The future feels dauntingly precarious, and I am not very good at smiling into the uncertain abyss and welcoming the unexpected tide.

My depression includes hours of wallowing, sulking and brooding. I often lay around draping blankets over myself producing a cavernous effect and ruminating over the pain I have, focusing closely on the pain so that interjections of hope and positive thinking are reduced to sounding like irritating whispers. I often dwell over haunting memories of social humiliation, events of social humiliation that could have been avoided had I been more prudent and reserved about the things I chose to say and write. I do, it seems, have a history of social error associated with a poor regard for diplomatic politics or a poor regard for knowing which battles to pick, and not letting go of my anger, and instead saying and/or writing all the wrong things to express my anger. I sometimes construct ""what if"" hypotheticals and imagine the favorable outcomes that might have occured had I behaved properly and not committed the social errors. My depression also includes a rather self-loathing, hopeless internal monologue marked by variations of saying to myself: ""I am ugly. I am in adequate. I am not intelligent enough. I am a failure. Life is pointless. Why do I bother?"" I do not entertain existential questions about the meaning of life with a gallant curiosity, but rather a morbid defeatism. To many it is not troubling that life is inherently meaningless and that one needs to give it meaning, but to me this meaning assignment feels contrived and artificial. I'd much rather life have meaning independent of the meaning I could ever assign to it, and that some higher power (not necessarily a supernatural deity) could spell things out for me. This is a very common sentiment, I know. Feel free to yawn or scowl at how terribly banal my troubles are.

In spite of this debiliating depression, I guess I am moderately-high functioning. I am functional enough to perform decently to quite well on my my coursework, and attend courses on school days. I am functional enough to entertain fluctuating hopes and ambitions. I am functional enough to sometimes look for inspiration and a spark to carry on. I am functional enough to see if I can be more resilient. I am functional enough to write this ad, (though taking the time to post something like this in a place like this probably speaks more to dysfunction.)

So I am reaching my quivering hand into this cyber cesspool in hopes that I might find someone similar, someone who has been in this cavern, or who is still there, or who has emerged and has been on a mostly upwards trajectory since. My hope is that after exchanging many detailed, introspective, psycho-analytic, thoughtful letters and discussions with a like-minded person, that I might find something short of catharsis if not a greater, less fluctuating will to live. My hope is also to derive meaning and self-importance from being valued similarly in someone else's life -- if not valued as a pillar of support to someone, then as an indispensibly special person to them. And finally, my hope is to build a connection that makes me eventually feel strong enough to not feel I have to lean on others. I would like to be strong enough to one day stand on my own feet.

There are certain personality/mental types I particularly favor: I like someone who has a dominant, assertive personality, but a dominant personality who does not lead with a controlling and/or arrogant foot, but who leads rather with a firm confidence as well as a compassionate regard for my views and preferences. I favor someone who is very reassuring and who won't grow tired or conspicuously annoyed with giving me assurances. I like someone who won't consider dealing with my depression to be a task or burden. (At worst, you may find dealing with my depression an ethical duty, but it best I would hope you derive some happiness and self-importance from it.) I like someone who is good at reading non-verbals (since I can be a timid, awkward communicator) and someone who can be forward and caring enough in their communication style to help me communicate better. I like a very conciliatory person who won't receive my grievances in defensive anger and criticism and who is instead constructive enough to listen to them, not walk away, and try to mend the rupture and reconcile. I like someone who appreciates very candid psychological admissions and who can reciprocate in such candid discussions and eventually not hold anything back about his life. I like someone who can stomach and respond compassionately to graphic detail regarding morbid ideation instead of recoiling in repulsion and abandoning me. I favor someone who will not flake and have unexplained absences, and someone who is intent on building an enduring connection and who has enough time and sense of commitment to keep in regular touch.

While psychologically, emotionally intimate discussions can set the scene for a budding romance, I imagine an amorous connection could potentially impede or complicate my aim for managing my depression (as well as your aim for managing depression, if that is your aim.) But I am open, in due time, to warm embraces and platonic affectionate gestures. I think this is an important barrier and that we should honor it for the sake of our health and for the sake of ensuring an enduring connection.

After exchanging thoughtful letters, texts and phone calls, I imagine these sorts of outings: taking BART from city to city and getting off at your favorite stops where you will lead the way, catching a good movie at a movie theatre, drinking hot tea while walking around a lake at night, lying down on the grass or sitting on a bench and sharing our ruminations and dreams, me resting my head on your shoulder as you comment elaboratively and sometimes humorously on the people who walk by, going on long bike rides at night with music with you leading the way and caring for me if I clumsily get injured, engaging in unabashed voyeurism at quirky venues or in general, looking at antique furniture together (which you will know more about than me), going to museums (which you will be better at talking your way through), reading to one another, sitting and listening to music together (preferring melancholy scores over sulking excessively with the painful tracks of The Smiths, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Elliott Smith, Joni Mitchell and Radiohead etc.,) me spending a weekend at your far from bio-hazardous relatively clean place where we watch movies together, eat well, rearrange your living space if you find that fitting and have staring contests cut by interludes of shouting non sequiturs and obnoxious giggling if not flatulence. Finally, I imagine coming out of our time spent together feeling uplifted, stronger, hopeful, needed and important. I imagine feeling that I have secured a long-term comrade and confidant. But maybe that is an all too loaded, idealistic and thus dangerous expectation to have. Perhaps I ought to look forward to what pleasant time someone can offer while they can offer it and appreciatively live in the moment and condition myself to expect less since one of my self-help aims is learning to be less needy and dependent and expectant. 

I thought I would end this ad (which will no doubt attract gratuitous genitalia photos and insults like ""You think you have it so bad, huh?"" or ""You sound so pretentious and demanding!"" or unsolicited trite advice like ""Just get out more! Be positive!""), by listing some academic interests/pursuits: journalism, social welfare, sociology (an intersectional perspective that accounts for race, class, sexuality and other social stigma), doing archival/historical research, rhetoric/argumentation, social activist efforts, ethnic and gender studies, African diaspora studies, history (early to present U.S., medieval to modern Europe, South Asia and the Middle East, th ancient Near East, etc.,) political science (early to present party ideology and party politics, voter habits, race and gender in party politics), critiquing idealogues and pop culture, film studies, comparative literature (deconstruction, literary theory, semiotics, the activity of interpretation/comparing interpretation methods, assessing which and why what literary interpretations are more optimal than others, comparing Enlightenment era thinkers, etc.), philosophy (have been largely unsuccessful with Kant, Wittgenstein, Frege and many others,) etc.

Well, fellow depression-survivor, I look forward to hearing from you. Feel free to write at length -- I do appreciate detail and a thoughtfulness for crafting prose, be it a less controlled prose style reminiscent of the melodramatic introspection of Virginia Woolf or Proust, or the more controlled, snide, economical command for epigram of Oscar Wilde, mixed in with the somehow endearing bitterness of Allen Ginsberg. I like many types of writing and writers, (so long as you do not seem too eerily close to Nolan's protagonist from ""Following."") In your response, please tell me your age, what you do (work, school, etc), what your daily routine is like, how much free time you have in your schedule for keeping in touch (I favor regular texting at the very least and weekly if not bi-monthly outings), what area you live in, whether or not you like going on long drives, what your interests/hobbies are, what is the nature of your depression, what treatments you have already tried and what you hope to change, what you hope to get out of our correspondence, why you choose to live, etc.

Hi everyone! 

I am diving in the craigslist waters searching for my awesome mermaid loving, unicorn tribe of amazing people!

I am a free spirit, creative, non judgmental, educated, compassionate, outgoing, adventurous woman. I love exploring, traveling, great food, photography, writing, art, museums, galleries, comedy shows, being at the ocean and spending time with my loved ones. I can easily dress up for a night out on the town or dress down and go to a bar or go to watch a live game.I am very adaptable and fit in with most groups very nicely.

I have a very loving, sweet, genuine nature. I am part unicorn, part mermaid, part ganja goddess. I am an advocate, supporter and writer regarding cannabis. I have chronic pain and cannabis has helped save my life and it is important for my friends and partner to be completely accepting an understanding of that and my passion for attending festivals and cannabis related events.

I currently live in Santa Rosa and I am a pinup model by the name of Red Velvet. I am with a group called The Classic Bombshell Beauties and we raise money for our local veterans. I am trying to move to San Francisco within one month. 

I'm looking to make friends all over San Francisco and just put inner Richmond because I have a love of Ocean Beach and I am truly hoping to live around that area but that is still an uncertainty at this point.

I am looking for friends who will love, appreciate and be genuinely interested in making real and lasting friendships.
I am looking for people who are mindful, non judgmental, outgoing, respectful, kind, loyal and genuine. I would love to meet friends who enjoy adventures, traveling, festivals, exploring the city, creating shenanigans, starting wild random groups, having game night's, going to the farmers market and then cooking together and watching fun reruns of old school shows together. People who love life, exploring the world around us and showing compassion to others. I love art and I would love for my friends to join me in that! 

I look forward to meeting you all and creating long-lasting friendships and terrific memories!

I am looking for somebody who is real coo and laid back and I mean somebody who likes to laugh as well as laugh at themselves. For some reason people seem to think that nowadays when somebody says to Netflix and chill is something sexual but with me it means just that because there is a lot of good movies and shows on Netflix. I have to state this but I am not looking for sex, repeat I am not looking for sex so that means no fwb situation involving sex but I am however looking for a woman friend I can flirt with. Also it is a shame that I have to state this too but I am only looking for women who were born women and women who are single and not married or in a relationship. I the type of guy who will give you attention like text you out of nowhere or have fun and funny conversations and trust me if I was in your life you would be laughing whenever you talked to me or laughing about what I said the last time you talked to me. 

I am 6'2 stocky thick build brown chocolate skin brown eyes full lips deep voice facial hair big hands and feet no tattoos only my ears pierced.

Ladies I know every time you search online you always see guys looking for sex and I know that gets annoying. I hope you're like me and think to yourself why can't I find a good friend without sex being involved? I feel the same way because I am looking for a woman who not trying to have sex but wants to have a good friend to be on their side. I am looking for attention and flirtation instead of sex, I want fun times and good memories. I want to find a friend who I can go and visit new places with and just have a good time. I already have a few places that I looked up that I would love to visit but the thing is visiting new places by yourself is really boring but going with a friend makes things more fun and exciting. I would love a woman friend who is outgoing and not too closed in or shy but not too outrageous either. Like I said I love attention so a woman texting me all the time or send me pictures is not a problem to me and it never has been, because I figure I pay for mine phone monthly I might as well use it right? When I say flirtatious I am talking about I want a woman friend who doesn't mind a little play wrestling or play fight or hitting each other with pillows or somebody who wouldn't get made if I grabbed or slapped her butt out of nowhere. I also have to say please have a car and be mobile and of course please be single and if you have kids I don't have a problem with that but make sure you have time in your life before you message me. So if this sounds like something you're into please reply with (adventure) as your subject title in your response please and thank you

I'm very trustworthy, cleared a Background check with no problems last Summer. I have a FICA score of about 830. I pay all my bills on time. I'm frugal. I enjoy cooking, walking, listening, and have a fairly mild manner most of the time. I do not smoke, no drugs, and seldom drink.

I do not live in San Jose at this time. But, with Medi-Care A & B kicking in soon, I have to be near a Kaiser or I lose my medical benefits! Thus, why I'm seeking a Senior person who might enjoy sharing their house/apt.with another Senior person [me!]. I am retired and live on a modest monthly pension. I'm pretty handy and can help you around your place. I even do yard work. 

I assure you that my intentions are more for friendship/companionship/partnership* with someone my age. So, if interested, email me and then we will take it from there. Thanks..... 
*I am not looking for a free ride situation! I am willing to pay a small rent fee.

ONLY SENIOR AGED PERSONS NEED REPLY...that means YOU are 60yrs old or older!

I know that most people only browse CL for entertainment value...to see if anything can still shock their jaded sensibilities, but there are messages of genuine substance to be discovered...even here. 

I'm looking for the woman who is unhappily married but who needs to stay married for practical reasons. The woman who lacks intimacy in and out of the bedroom. What I don't want is lunch time sex. I want a woman that has the flexibility to experience life with me outside the bedroom as well. I want someone who I think about when I wake up in the morning and when I lay down at night. I want the woman who makes my heart sing when I hear her voice on my phone or get an email from her.. 

Making love is incredible when relationships are nurtured and emotional bonds are formed. I have no plans to leave the marriage that I'm in -- it's just too complicated -- but I'm not willing to live out the rest of my life unfulfilled either. 

There must be a woman who finds herself in a similar situation -- a woman who is ready to build a long-term, secondary relationship. 
Honestly, the concept of an affair seems quite easy. Two attached people make a decision to mess around and well the rest is history. However, the more complicated question is how do those two attached people make it known that they are open to such an arrangement.

About me: 

Others would typically describe me as being laid back, very funny, considerate, respectful, spontaneous and at time shy. I like sports , reading, beach/camping, independent and mainstream films, dancing, hiking, road trips, Cooking, Cricket and good restaurants ( who doesn't). But I would trade them all for a night of warmth and cuddling at home in front of a good movie and some great take out food... Care to join...(wink)


About you: 

The woman I am looking for married like me but is starved for intimacy and ready for a sensual and cerebral adventure. I am discerning and patient; this is only worth doing if it really feels right. She has darker hair and eyes...maybe olive complexion...she might be of Latin, Mediterranean, Asian, or mixed heritage. For that matter, she could be a striking brunette of any origin....the dark features are just my preference. She is fit and feminine. Her hands are soft and graceful...they fit nicely in my large grasp. 

Naturally none of us should be into games or one-nighters! If we are on the same page about what we want, send me an email -- possibly to explore this discreet, adventurous new friendship

So.. Here's the situation: I'm a dude lookin for some new friends. Thing is, I've never had a problem makin friends with other guys. Girls though, that's a different story. It may be possible that I've just been introduced to the wrong ones. THOSE ""friends"" normally just wanted to hang out during parties, drink all my liquor and then they'd disappear till the next party. And they'd normally want a free ride to and from the party. Not down for that. I mean, don't get me wrong, I definitely wouldn't mind having a friend that I can drink with, in fact, I enjoy drinkin with my friends, but I'm looking for friends I can also kick it with when we're NOT drinkin.

About me: Half Hispanic, Half Filipino, I like movies, tv, music, art, video games, beer, hanging out, drivin, among other things.

You: Be awesome, like similar things, be around my age like somewhere around 20-30, live near my area.

Fun Fact: If you're a Legend of Zelda fan, we might be besties. If you dislike Legend of Zelda, we might be mortal enemies.

Anywayz, if you're lookin for a new friend, I'm here. Send me an email if you're interested. If you wanna just text first that's cool with me, but I would like to kick it eventually. I'd write more about myself, but I feel that's something that we could talk about when we kick it. Also, I didn't post a pic cause this is Craigslist and I think it's weird, but I'll send one if you want, and I'd want one in return. I mean, I would like to place a face to the person I'm talkin to.

Or you can send me a Kik: S_Flame

Hope to hear from you soon!

I know I am a great man that will show you great times with great fun and great laughter.

I have to state this but I am not looking for sex, repeat I am not looking for sex so that means no fwb situation involving sex but I am however looking for a woman friend I can flirt with. Also it is a shame that I have to state this too but I am only looking for women who were born women and women who are single and not married or in a relationship. I the type of guy who will give you attention like text you out of nowhere or have fun and funny conversations and trust me if I was in your life you would be laughing whenever you talked to me or laughing about what I said the last time you talked to me.

I am 6'2 stocky thick build brown chocolate skin brown eyes full lips deep voice facial hair big hands and feet no tattoos only my ears pierced. I don't sag my pants and I always wear a belt and I always like to smell good whenever I leave the house. I don't discriminate on anybody so I like all races of women and I don't care about age as long as you're over 18. I am trying to bring happiness to your life and I am not going to give you any money, use you or abuse you in any way, I just want you to be yourself and I just want to see that beautiful smile.

I realize this may sound like a weird post, but I have no idea where else to post it. Doesn't quite fit in casual encounters or M4W because I'm not necessarily looking to meet or establish a relationship. In any case, please bear with me and if this isn't your thing, kindly ignore it and move on.

So admittedly, I have a fetish for sheer nylon stockings and pantyhose. I don't wear them myself as that does nothing for me, but I love seeing women in them. I don't have any friends that I'm aware of that share this fetish, therefore, no one to talk to about it. Just wondering if there's a woman here on Craigslist that may share my fetish and are interested in talking about it. Again, I'm not necessarily looking to meet unless we're both compelled to do so. We can just exchange emails or chat on Kik.

If you're interested, I'd love to hear from you. Women of all ages/race/shape/size/etc are welcomed to reply! Hope everyone has an amazing day!

Hey, thanks for reading my post.
About myself, I'm a Chinese college student, 20 years old, friendly, sentimental, patient. As said in title, I'm looking for a gay friend to hang out with, cuddle with and start a friendship. Hope you're between 18 and 35, respectful and looking for just gay friends too. I don't drive so I hope you do. I take care of friends seriously so I expect long-term friendship. However, I don't want to get into relationship for now and I can assure you that's zero possibility to happen. About sex, maybe we can cuddle and I'm a fetish for sneakers, socks and feet, so it will be awesome if you're interested too, but no SM, no master&slave role play, and no anal sex. Just play around on the safe side you know. Contact me if you'd like to explore more about me and hang out with me. Let's start with a nice chat! Oh please send me a face picture of yours and I promise I'll send back mine to you immediately. Also tell me what you're looking for.
Thank you again for reading my post!

I've been exploring CA for years. I've been to Death Valley eleven times and I especially, love deserts and wide open spaces.

I'm a very youthful retired late middle-aged woman (I have many friends in their 40s and 50s). Road trips for me include easy hiking and exploring local towns' thrift stores and shops. I'm quite flexible about duration of trips, from day-trips, to one or two nights or longer. My biggest problem in retirement has been finding women who have the time, money and desire to hit the road without much of an agenda. 

I have a wide range of interests and I love to laugh. I don't get my knickers in a twist over much. I'm a writer and big reader.

You must be able to pull your own weight and share expenses such as gas and lodging. 

Spontaneity and a sense of humor and curiosity are absolutely essential. 

The point of road trips is to take a break from daily life so please be able to disconnect from electronica except for basic checking in with relatives and such. I don't want to find myself staring at the top of your head as you text and photograph your food.

Let's talk and meet and see if we're on the same page. The days are getting longer and I'll soon be rarin' to go. I have a brand new Kia Rio and a GPS. It's easier if you're in or near San Francisco, but not essential.

I'm not averse to tent camping, and still have my equipment.

So whenever Im at a bar, I think how I could go up and talk to people there, but they just become the 1 night bar friend you know? Or you add them on Facebook but never talk. After that you never hear from them. Sure you can meet people who stick with you, but I have yet to see that. Anyways, I'm simply looking for a kind of woman who loves to go out, who would love to go out the pier, the beach, downtown, a bar, or wherever we go and simply have a good time and chat about what revolves around our life and everything else. Just because I'm a guy doesn't always have to mean that I'm just looking to hook up. I'm simply looking for a woman to call my friend right now, and to ask her out for a fun night, that's it. I like to text, but really I'm all about meeting up for a coffee and talk in person, like it should be anyways. A little about me would be that my name is Alexander, I'm 21, I have a job as a lyft driver, I'm single, I'm Hispanic, and the rest we could talk about it in person haha.

Hi, I'm looking for hiking partners in the bay area. I'm open to meeting either men(I'm straight) or women. I'd do the ""meetup"" thing but they're just too crowded and very casual; having a real conversation/connection is nearly impossible.

My favorite hike's are in Mill Valley but anywhere in the north bay is great for hikes. Pacifica is also full of great hikes. The hike I find to be the most grueling is Mt Diablo, especially in the summer when it's hot out. My go-to hike is San Bruno Mt, and I can usually string those trails together for 10 miles.

As for me, I'm 35, fairly athletic, an ambivert(introvert/extrovert) if I'm going to put a label on myself; I'm friendly(people actually tell me this) and outgoing, but enjoy the peace and calm of nature. I'm a great listener, great at communication, into psychology, and the human condition. I'm well traveled and can converse with pretty much anyone who speaks my language.

My best friends are married with children so they aren't available as much as I'd like them to be, and I broke up with my girlfriend 6 months ago so I'm still figuring out how to occupy that time she filled. Not heartbroken if that's what you're thinking. Let me know if you'd like to meet, thanks

I know the title sounds dramatic, but the reality is that while I'm mostly healed from my childhood sexual and physical abuse emotionally, yet I'm still at a point where I find it very hard to be intimate and connect with women in a dating context. I've had 3 short relationships in the past 10 years and been alone the rest of the time. When single, I don't date casually or ""hook up"", which means I go long periods of time without any kind of physical contact and comfort. Lately I'm really missing the emotional support it provides and because of how busy I am with some new work endeavors, I have no time to date. So if I could find a kind, generous girl to be a good friend and non-sexual cuddle buddy it would really give me something I've been sorely lacking and missing and would provide emotional/physical support as pursue my new career goals. Also, please don't judge this, but I would prefer an Asian or Indian woman simply because I've spent a lot of time in that part of the world and feel more at peace there and thus I've found a greater ability to detach from the normal associations of my past abuse in intimate/physical contact with Asian/Indian women.

I am looking for someone who is in need of a place to live (no income needed) and who will help with projects around the house, starting a garden, composting, cleaning, organizing, etc. I am currently overwhelmed with life in general and the craziness that I have surrounded myself with at this time. I need positivity around me as well as someone who can help get me motivated.

I am 31years old and not very social. I have given up on finding love and instead I am looking for a partner(s) who want to eventually homestead (and can start small today) and who have similar ideals and values. I live on a small lot in Lucerne, ca. It is not a large yard however I want to find someone to assist me in my quest for sustainability. I eventually (next two years max) will find a large acreage where I can homestead full time with all sorts of animals and crops and this person would be willing to start over with me when I buy more property.

this would be the perfect fit for someone who is nonjudgmental, positive, friendly, does't smoke or use tobacco products or drugs (although others on the property smoke cigs another would be too much for me and eventually I would like the property to be smoke free), there is alcohol consumed here although it doesn't typically get out of hand. You must love dogs (as I have many) and all living creatures/things. 

I am 420 friendly, although I don't smoke, and I am open to all kinds of individuals as well as ages (over 18) who are willing to work towards self-sufficientcy and achieving shared dreams. You have to be willing to put in a lot of effort and this is not a task for the faint of heart but your efforts will be rewarded long term.

A bit about the property and living situation:it is not a desirable situation for someone with other viable alternatives. There is often complete chaos within the group that lives in the mobile home and they will perhaps attempt to sabotage our efforts at communal living which is why someone who is generally understanding of the pressures that come from trying to escape poverty and homelessness, calm under pressure and does not react to ignorance or verbally combative conversations is a must. We are great in some ways though -we share, we care and are trying to be better as a group and individuals (some more than others)and if you are willing to put in the effort to get along with us and our craziness you will fit in and perhaps we can grow and learn with each other.

Please put homesteader in the subject line of any reply so that I know you are real and not a robot and include a bit about you, what you have going on in your life (your current situation) and your expectations as far as what you are willing and not willing to live with and anything you feel you would like to add. As a side note I will remove this posting once I find someone.

So I've been consistently going back to the gym since last December, and honestly I feel as though I've hit a wall in my progression and results. While trying to figure out why my situation has become so stale, it's come to my attention that I generally go alone to the gym, which I find too mundane and impossible to stay motivated. I'm not huge but I'd like to think I'm athletic and in shape and I genuinely enjoy working out. My hope is that I can find a like-minded individual(s) who can help keep me motivated just as I would for you. I really don't care what race you are or your body type, I'm only interested in your motivation and drive to workout. My only actual preference is that you have a 24 hour Fitness gym membership as thats where I tend to workout although I'm willing to make exceptions.

Hi - If you are a woman, unattached, over Age 50 and like what you read below, I would like to hear from you with a little background and your personal goals. Photo is appreciated. 

A little about me: 

Relocated to the bay area from NJ/NY, in 1979. Yes, I miss the Big Apple and hope to go back and visit. 

Mild-mannered gentleman, College-Educated, non-judgmental, non-smoker, Fit/Healthy, romantic, financially & emotionally secure. I grew up travelling throughout Europe and the Middle East, because my dad was a international bank executive tasked with helping establishing bank branches, in many major cities in Europe and the middle east. I finally landed in NJ/NY area in 1970. My college and grad schooling were in upstate NY (Troy, NY).

Started my semi retirement, in early 2014.

My friends describe me as fun to be around, respectful, well-rounded, witty, calm, honest, compassionate, kind, sensitive, romantic & affectionate.. there are few more, I hope you discover'em! (Nooooooo, I am not near perfect - nor trying to be).

The outdoors, gardening, cooking, dancing, ethnic cuisine, sunsets, music, the theatre, classic movies, travel, moonlights.... & Life are among the things I enjoy.

I am fluent in French (the language).

I am not deterred by body type, religion, skin color or ethnicity so long we connect comfortably and harmoniously. I have a catholic background, but I am not fanatic about it. Among other components, I find Balance, Kindness, Sanity & Harmony are essential in Life.

My taste in music gravitates around Jazz, Classic Rock, World music... 

I prefer a romantic candlelight dinner with music, by the fireplace, to watching TV.

Meanwhile, Happy Holidays!

Don't know why I'm posting as I know I won't get a response but here's to trying.

So I don't have much friends, not really anyone close to talk to. Although I'm in a committed relationship, I feel an empty void which ceases any motivation to do anything new. Am I just settling? 

I wish I can find a nice pen pal or even good female friend. A best friend. A gym partner to motivate health, A geeky girl for gaming entertainment, a realist to converse with. Share stories, share opinions, and most of all a guide to life. 

I don't know what I'm doing but I'm letting life respond...

I've tried other places, and dating websites to find new friends. But things never work out as they are either interested in dating, or don't believe when I say I'm looking for a friend.

Also if you're interested in chatting or miss the old instant messaging days. Message me on kik oxy1984.

Life's meant to be lived but recently I feel like its become a monotonous one way street. I am in a loving relationship but its become a relationship filled with chores and things to finish. I have also realized that I don't have any friends who are women; just the guy friends to go watch football or drink beer on a random weekend. 

I am hoping against hope that maybe on CL I can find a woman also in a similar predicament. Don't you wish someone would send you fun messages while at work? Yes! Do you dream about the excitement of seeing a flirty email describing things we could do sometime? I do! 

Me: mid 30s, attached, hwp, love movies, hiking, swimming, am a total foodie. 

You: 30s to 40s, also attached (so we can relate)

Hi, 

Shall we?


And yes I'm married as well as you should be if you are reading this...but in need and search of more since i cant really change my current situations.... I guess I would like to find someone with the same needs

I'm not alone I bet... Life is way too short to keep loosing time as we are getting older everyday...

shall we?

We can find ourselves in situations that seemingly have no end. My wife has become more of a roommate than anything else. Circumstances that I will not go into here prevent me from leaving. Been together for a long time and now we just pass each other in the night. There are stupid arguments, stupid fights, no ugly but dormant. It's impossible to talk. Who would understand? Who would even believe? After all, we're the 'Perfect Couple'. We are what everyone envision as the 'perfect' marriage.

I am looking for a confident, friends with benefits, or anything with passion. I want companionship, friendship, communication, mutual respect, trust and caring. I'm looking for someone, preferably married, who may be in a similar situation and looking for a little something more in their life.

Let's be each others friend, companion, confidant and possibly lovers if it goes that far. Communication is key with me. I like to exchange cute emails and chats during the day. It's simply a lot of fun because I'm a also romantic at heart. I'm not looking to be your new husband nor am I looking for you to be my new wife. When we can, we'll steal moments away with each other.

I'm an educated hard working professional, funny, discreet, humorous, caring, polite, respectful, laid back person that knows how to treat a lady as a lady. 
body : average height : 5-10

age: 45

Imagine the possibilities...

You are in a marriage or long term situation that has lost something. . . that special connection that brought you into the marriage in the first place. You have tried so hard to connect with your spouse yet you realize you are the one doing all of the work. The intimacy is gone s you stay because of family obligations, a financial situation or because that is what you do. . ..

You are looking for someone to share your thoughts and desires of the day with -- someone who is open, honest and willing to have a real conversation - someone who will look forward to your IM or emails. Someone who can provide a special connection only two people can understand.

We will take the time to really get to know each other through conversation. We would care for each other - we might even find that we crave each other in every way possible. We won't be rushed and we won't settle and we hate hook ups. Right now we just need each other because want and need a positive relationship in our lives.

This can only happen if we find each other.

I am not looking to change your situation or mine. I would prefer to speak via email, IM or chat first to get to know each other. If there is a connection then I am open to possibly meeting.

Please be between the ages of 35-50, live within 30 to 45 minutes of Bay area, easy going (with a sexy personality), decent shape as I workout regularly. I am mostly open to most nationalities as long as they are respectful however I'm most attractted light complesure
ladies!!!

I am a married male in my 40's. I am a professional who loves indoors and outdoor activities. I enjoy laughing and having an honest conversation. I am not into judging others and I preferred not to be judge. I am a strong man with an easygoing personality, non-smoker, not into drugs, light drinker, and disease free. I prefer someone similar.

Hello! I'm a professional photographer of over ten years, shooting mostly abandoned locations such as hospitals, jails, military facilities, railways, desert landscapes, forest resorts, and historic buildings throughout California. I've also been working with models (pro and amateur) for portraits, film set previews, and storyboard projects for several years now as well.

I'm looking for a female model who can pose nude or semi-nude for my current photography project titled ""Urban Decay: Hidden Beauty Within"".

**Please Note: This is NOT an erotic project. Any/all offers will be reported and deleted immediately.**

Processed originals will be available to you at no cost (free) in exchange for your time and use. -- Great for amateurs or new models who want to build their portfolios!!

The locations I will be shooting the project in are:
- San Jose
- Morgan Hill
- Gilroy
- Saratoga
- Santa Cruz Mountains
- Seaside
- Monterey
- Treasure Island
- SF Presidio
- Marin Headlands

The majority of the shots will be in daylight, but if agreed upon, may include some nighttime moonlit exposure shoots as well (weather-dependant). -- **If you are interested and able to travel outside the bay area, I also shoot on filmset locations throughout the Mojave Preserve several times a year.

All areas where we shoot are always safe and secure, and none are within the public eye to maintain respect and privacy. You (the model) are welcome to bring a friend to the photoshoot as long as the friend does not interfere with the model or disrupt the photographer during the photoshoot.

I'm specifically looking for models with the following traits:
- Age: 18-45
- Build: skinny, thin, average
- Cup Size: A-C
- Skin Tone: light, pale, white
- Tattoos: None, some okay
- Piercings: None, some, alot, more
- Body Mods: None

We will meet for a basic interview and discussion of the project first before visiting the locations for the photo shoot. Your own transportation is required unless prior arrangements are made.

All potential models will need to sign a Model Release Form before starting work. This form is basically a written agreement stating that I have permission to photograph you and to use your image in my photography works.

Any questions or discuss the project, please ask! Please also send one head shot and one full-body shot for consideration (no erotic or porn photos please).

Hope to hear from you soon! -- Have a great day!

I'm a polite, respectful, fit, and handsome male who is looking for a group of women who might want to bring a unique twist into their book club. What I propose is that I attend your next get-together as your nude helper/server for the event. I would serve the food and drinks, take care of any chores you had for me, and do whatever I could to make the event a nice one. But I'd be in my birthday suit.

I know this whole idea is crazy, but the fact is that I love women and think they should all have a nude guy to cater to them. Even though this concept sounds outlandish, I promise that I'm a completely respectful and kind guy. 

I'm pretty smart too, so I'd be happy to participate in the discussion - or to keep quiet and just be seen but not heard. That'd be up to you women. 

Please let me know if you're interested and if you have any questions. I'm especially interested in meeting up with a group of older women. Show the kids and grandkids that you're still capable of some outside-the-box and surprising fun!!!

Just kidding! I was just trying to get your attention.

Seriously though I'm posting in the strictly platonic section because I'm looking for a pen pal. I'm not looking for someone to meet and hang out with right now because I keep a very busy schedule that limits my free time. However I do miss just talking to someone about random things.

I'm looking for other Lesbians (born female like myself) who are in a relationship or married and have no extra time to hang out. So having a pen pal is ideal for you because of your busy schedule.

Nothing about this ad is code for sex or dating. I am ugly, fat, have horrible skin and am happily taken :)

Some things that I'm into are taking trips to explore new places, trying new restaurants, watching sports, being outdoors as much as I can, listening to a lot of music, joking and laughing as much as possible, arts and crafts, concerts, sticking to a workout schedule, organic foods, cooking, and animal advocacy.

I do not smoke anything. I don't drink alcohol or soda.

If you want to write then please do otherwise good luck and happy searching.

**born women only please**

So.. Here's the situation: I'm a dude lookin for some new friends. Thing is, I've never had a problem makin friends with other guys. Girls though, that's a different story. It may be possible that I've just been introduced to the wrong ones. THOSE ""friends"" normally just wanted to hang out during parties, drink all my liquor and then they'd disappear till the next party. And they'd normally want a free ride to and from the party. Not down for that. I mean, don't get me wrong, I definitely wouldn't mind having a friend that I can drink with, in fact, I enjoy drinkin with my friends, but I'm looking for friends I can also kick it with when we're NOT drinkin.

About me: Half Hispanic, Half Filipino, I like movies, tv, music, art, video games, beer, hanging out, drivin, among other things.

You: Be awesome, like similar things, be around my age like somewhere around 20-30, live near my area.

Fun Fact: If you're a Legend of Zelda fan, we might be besties. If you dislike Legend of Zelda, we might be mortal enemies.

Anywayz, if you're lookin for a new friend, I'm here. Send me an email if you're interested. If you wanna just text first that's cool with me, but I would like to kick it eventually. I'd write more about myself, but I feel that's something that we could talk about when we kick it. Also, I didn't post a pic cause this is Craigslist and I think it's weird, but I'll send one if you want, and I'd want one in return. I mean, I would like to place a face to the person I'm talkin to.

Or you can send me a Kik: S_Flame

I'm a regular type person yet born heart-evolved, young at heart, a Lightworker, age 60, attractive, about to begin another part of my journey, the main portion of my Divine Life Purpose work. Desire someone to share life experiences, ups and downs, on our ongoing growth paths, with compassionate healing focuses on all levels-- mental emotional physical spiritual financial but mostly like to keep things simple, and focused on the heart, with deep self compassion and compassion for others. 

I am currently preparing to do a variety of work to create a financial foundation, dogwalking, groceryshopping, while I prepare to become an Angel Therapist (helping others connect to their Angels for healing all parts of their life). I do embrace basic spiritual laws like Ask & you will receive, and pay attention to your own beliefs to find blockages to receiving,etc but I mostly keep a grounded and honest focus, although I am basically an optimist with faith I also have a simple discerning tool that regularly sees red flags in myself and life so I can help heal or release things. Also I use basic humanistic psychology to see relationship dynamics needing to be healed in the world, with others and within oneself, often originating from one's childhood family issues, etc. My view of the world is that we are all blessed by the Divine and all have access to the Divine, and we all are receiving Divine assistance to bring thru healing for humanity and the earth, one person at a time, based on freewill choices. 

I'm also aware of the Sonoma State University archives of Project Censored, and the corporate greed going on. But mostly I just like to focus on creating a simple, grounded, compassionate life for myself and close friends. And would love to have someone to go with to the park and the river, and maybe some other event we could enjoy together. I'm becoming a vegetarian soon, and I'm trying to get in shape by simple stretching, but don't do any intense strenuous activity, although I used to dance and will be doing so again. 

I am a basically compassionate person and don't harm others, and need a friend who is similar, I am not judgemental but I am getting very clear about what type of support is nourishing for me. I need a little head but a lot of heart too. I'm not very emotional exactly, but I can be passionate about social justice issues, and when my heart is open I can cry in empathy with tears. Looking for a friend in the same ballpark, so we can support each other, but also have access to our own intuitive guidance and listen to our own inner wisdom and bodywisdom. So we don't need to do much of anything but be compassionate witnesses for each other, and just both of us share and both of us listen. I'm planning on following Christiane Northrup book, Goddesses Never Age. 

Although I've been on a spiritual path, my childhood background has been to come from a more traditional background, so I had to work hard to release beliefs that interfered with my desired process, so in that way my orientation still reflects a much more grounded approach to all my work, simple, kind, loving, open, transparent, is how I approach the work and myself, so I still sometimes struggle as I'm creating a solid and fully self-loving perspective that will be perfect for me, healthy and grounded. I believe that many teachers don't realize how much they use anti-human language that disconnects them from their own feelings, authentic process, and natural comfort zone and body wisdom. I like to keep my path, my work, and my perspectives very simple and very grounded and very human oriented. If this all resonates with you simply and deeply, please write me. Looking forward to meeting you.

Hey there!

Are you also involved with someone, who at one time may have been exciting but no longer is? Not just sexually (though that may be a big deal for you), but emotionally? Have you drifted apart, yet stay together for your own reasons? Would you like to commiserate sometime over coffee? I'm buying! 

But seriously, I'm a handsome (maybe I'm bias), tall, average-built, also involved, 40-something, looking for a similar ""ear"" to share stories and even secrets with. I'm witty, intelligent, very cordial and considerate, love probing questions, and enjoy deep conversations -- especially the most controversial subjects.

I have no bounds, but my objective is NOT to have sex with you (unless of course we absolutely have to). Intimacy is a very interesting thing and can only truly be enjoyed when an emotional connection is made. Let's just leave that part out (for now) and see what happens . . . 

PS ... I won't hold you responsible for not liking me, physically or otherwise. We are complex creatures and like what we like. The end. :) 

Please say hello! 

I am 100% real and serious. You should be, too. And bots/prostitutes: DO NOT ask me to ""verify"" myself on your ""free"" site. I've not raped or killed anyone, nor have I thought about raping or killing anyone - ever, but thank you for your efforts. ;)

And neither should you. The sanctity of marriage is something we've created in our minds to address what seems to be a state of disorder. Some of you know this to be true and giggle about it as you browse these personals with your ""Bestie"". 

But you return to the vicious circle, a sucker for punishment. A life of servitude with little focus on the best things in life. A constant battle to silence your intuition. 

Oh, I can almost feel some of you begin to extend your claws, poised for attack. But I'm impervious! A layer of thick skin and a suit of chain mail and fresh filters installed. I speak not to the woman reading this but her innermost ""questionable"" desires. 

I won't sit here and dictate the sort of arrangement or relationship I'm looking for. It's far too dynamic. If you are a bitch, we will feed off of that and address it aggressively. If you are sweet and submissive, we will take things slowly and enjoy terms of mutual respect. If you are lonely and in need of attention, prepare to feel wholesome but don't expect a one way street. 

So get busy! Quit spending your morning coffee browsing ads and write something meaningful instead!

Cheers,

X.

Hello there, 

I have been married for many years and have a son. I love him deeply and could not possibly imagine separating from him. On the other hand, there are important elements that are missing in my marriage, such as the company, support, and love of my partner which has been missing since the very beginning. According to my wife, we are not compatible and it hurts me deeply. 

I don't like the idea to be separated from my kiddo, but at the same time I have some very serious needs. I love to talk and share my time with someone special. If you are in similar situation please let's talk. I am not looking for quick hookups. . ...just the idea of a good friendship with the purpose that perhaps someday it can evolve emotionally and physically later on. I am well groomed and handsome looking guy. 

I work full time and have graduate degree in engineering. Please let me know if you are in the similar situation and want to build a bond of friendship to start with.

I wished I could find some decent friends I feel like people don't like me I'm really a good person the people I work with always exclude me out . I'm never invited to join in unless they include everyone. They have their own click well it would be nice if I can find my own click and have fun hanging out doing things with females like getting pedicure nails hair done shopping maybe even going out to drink or getting out dressing up I have a lot of dressy clothes but no where nice to go. No parties or anything fun. Anyway I know I probably sound like a whiner but I'm just trying to find some female friends I can't make friends on Facebook although I have over 750 people I don't know locals on my Facebook. Well if you want to make a cool friend let me know

Your new Egalitarian friend is fun educated mensch, a refined omnivore cook with hedonistic health oriented tendencies whom you will need to guard away from all your men-hungry girl friends.

Start platonic and stay as virtual pen-pals until both of us agree that we ought to finally meet to determine our future as either best new platonic friends, or we dare to give serious romance a chance. 

No matter what the outcome, we stay as great new friends.

Super chill, adventurous, loud, funny, 420 friendly girl looking to make some good friends.
I get along best with other Libras & Gemini's but can usually vibe with everyone who I cross paths
with. I love dirtbikes, dogs, bars, clubs, hiking, beaches, horses, camping, coffee, hanging out
at the lake, all music and a bunch of other random stuff. I live on the peninsula but venture into SF &
the south bay often.

Looking for other chill girls or guys who are down for some bar crawls, beer pong, random adventures,
concerts and whatever else we can come up with. I don't do well with shy or awkward people as it tends to make me a little shy and awkward (I'm usually neither of those things).

Just to get this out of the way - I've been with a women for the last 9 years but don't identify as a lesbian, I just like who I like, gender doesn't really come into play for me. I don't care how you do or don't identify but you should absolutely be OK with who I am.

Minding your own damn business, you wander into Safeway. Maybe it was for some toilet paper? Frozen fish filets? Maybe some bagged salad? The cashier hands you a sealed green monopoly piece. You think, ""the hell am I going to do with this?"" But you feel the urge to accept it and smile. You fight your way through the parking lot where grandma is parked just a little too close to you, your gas light came on, and you're tired because Frank who lives next door was riding the pound town express all night (wait? was he calling out my name?). Green monopoly still in your grasp, you throw it on the passenger seat of your car, wasted like your prom night, never to be thought of again. 

Over and over this happens. Pretty soon you have so many of those godforsaken green monopoly pieces!! They're everywhere. After a while you finally open one up, my guess- a fucking paper cut!! ""Ain't that some bull shit!!"" You vow to rid these annoying green monopoly pieces. 

That's where I come in. I'm old, boring and totally get a lady boner collecting these things. If you're wanting good karma, and to totally help me get my rocks off. Send me your unopened green monopoly pieces.

I'm a desi man who works close to Grt Mall. I do visit there once in a while, either to just roam around, walk and window shop, or sometimes eat in food court when I'm alone. It is good to take break from work and stretch yourself.

However, it would be even better if I could meet someone who also visits Grt Mall, preferably another Indian woman! I've had many men friends, its time to gel with a woman. I am a good conversationalist, erudite, refined, classy and well traveled and well read. I would love to find an Indian woman who is bored during daytimes and visit Grt Mall, and also looking for a friend herself. 

We can have lunch together, take a walk together, get coffee, gel etc! We can be friends. Time pass during work day. Like an hour or two. Just unwind! I am seeking a daytime companionship and you too! You may be single or married doesn't matter. I'm married myself and my personal life has gone stale and I need a new friend. Your life needs a friend and distraction too. 

After some time, we can go together and window shop at either Coach or VS (you know what it is) or any other store. I might even think of spending for my lady friend.......

Why don't we connect? No harm right?

In good shape, 40, handsome, light skinned, easy going, short but full head of hair. Smell good and clean. Am a charmer!

I am a clean, DDF, fit/trim, healthy, married Indian man and very adventurous.....

I have found myself in a very unique situation. I have a lovely family and friends, but due to recent events in my life that have me feeling a bit unsettled and out sorts. I find that I am seeking a different type of support that my friends and family can not give me. I am single and at this time in my life and really wish I was not, but I am also not wanting to put forth the efforts to change that status, quite yet. But, I do realize I really need to find a man that can hold me and cuddle with me. I do not want sex!!! Please know that I am not seeking a hook up or sex!!! I just want to be held and cuddle.

I am attractive, tall and curvy/thick build. I am just mentioning what I look like, because there is nothing wrong with my appearance, I am just single, which for a 48 year old woman, can carry such a stigma in today's world. :( 

I am not super hung up on your appearance, but smelling good and good hygiene is a major plus!! I would really also like you to be single, cause I am sure, your wife or girlfriend would not appreciate you snuggling with an attractive, single lady. Please be employed and able to drive to my home and have a car! I have no clue if this will get any responses. But, CL seems to be the place to post unusual topics.

Please drop me a line if interested and we can start with chatting and go from there.

I am hoping to meet an attached lady with whom I can fall into conversation about anything and everything and the meaning of it all.

You know, the kind of conversations that can only be really held with a stranger.

You may ask: ""Couldn't you have these conversations with your spouse?"" Well, if you've been married for a while you already know that while we all need to talk about metaphysics, those who know us well want details and specifics, while strangers allow us to operate more vaguely on a cosmic scale....

When the talk occurs between two people that don't know each other, it gathers a special charge. After all, you can only say ""I feel like I've known you for years"" to someone you have *not* known for years :)

Funny how your spouse doesn't understand the bittersweet transience of life as well as a stranger encountered in a hotel bar or here on craigslist....

I'm looking for ways to promote my work, either in the form of capital donations, ideas and contacts, or even a collaboration with an established designer, so that I can finally bring my jewelry designs to a wider audience of customers.

I think I'm trying to mobilize any combination of the above into a public relations/advertising campaign, but I'm not sure how to go about it, who to trust or how to pay for it. 

In the past, I've had the opportunity to appear on a popular Washington D.C. morning show, promoting a past product, I've donated gift items to high profile charity events for auction/goody bags and have had my jewelry featured in several stores/galleries. I seem to have established a reputation as a very personable and dynamic spokesperson (they sell more when I'm there). In fact, it's been hard to tell where admiration for my jewelry line begins and appreciation of me ends. (please understand that this is not bragging for bragging sake; it has been a challenge to tell if they really like the jewelry, or me wearing the jewelry, more ... ) I'm approached at least 10 times a day, in random encounters, and complimented on any of my jewelry pieces that I make and wear. However, I need to find a way to translate that to actual sales. 

Any ideas or thoughts would be deeply valued.
Thank you!

Thanks for reading my ad and I am glad I caught your attention. I went back and forth with how I ought to title this ad and finally landed on advertising for a ""special discreet friendship."" This is my first foray into the world of seeking such a friendship since being married. I am simply interested in making my life a little more exciting, giving it an extra kick, having some intrigue. While I am still very much attached to my wife, the passion has somehow slipped away and my relationship has dulled over time. It is very comfortable, but not exciting. Do you feel that way? It may be that you and I just email each other some spicy titillating (although respectful) emails; it may be that we decide to discreetly meet and chat over coffee/tea, or maybe explore things further if we are both mutually inclined. There are lots of possibilities. As far as I am concerned, we can't go wrong...

I am a Caucasian man, tall, attractive, stocky, gym-goer, early fifties, advanced degrees, professional, live and work in San Francisco, clean-cut, respectful, and very discreet. I would love to hear from women -- married or single between the ages of 25 and 60 -- who, for whatever reasons, want to engage in a friendship in which all limits are respected yet at the same time exploration is in the cards (whether that be through e-mails, meet ups, etc.). I am honestly very open about how all of this might unfold. In the end, I do not wish to negatively impact my marriage and I don't want you (or your spouse/partner) hurt in any way; this is a very important value I hold dear and to which I am committed. 

I hope you are further intrigued by reading my ad and I hope to hear from you. I will reply to all who respond to my ad. Please tell me a bit about yourself (age, description, and any information about yourself that you would like to share) and what compelled you to answer my ad. What is your situation at the moment? What would you hope for out of a special friendship like this? I'll promise to get in touch with you soon.

I very much look forward to hearing from you... To know for sure that your email is not coming from a (ro)bot, please put the name of your favorite city in the subject line of your email. Thanks again and I hope to hear from you.

Hello,

I am an avid outdoors person and a safe, experienced climber. Unfortunately, my regular climbing partners have all moved away one by one due to the economy and other reasons. I have not climbed regularly in a while but wish to begin climbing seriously again. I prefer to climb outdoors and intend to get outside as much as possible as the weather permits but will happily climb in a gym when outside is not an option. I would prefer to link up with a female climbing partner for the time being. I've climbed with many people over the years and I just prefer to focus on the climbing now and not the egos and competitiveness that male climbers typically bring with them.

Hi guys, girls or small groups of friends. I need help experiencing a new fantasy I want to try. After being wrapped in a base of plastic wrap (Saran wrap), I want to be wrapped, head to toe, like a mummy, in duct tape. 

I found videos, on the internet, of people being mummified in duct tape. I found it extremely exciting, and I want it to be done to me. Obviously, I cannot do it myself. So, I need willing volunteers who would have fun wrapping me up in duct tape. 



I read blogs, online, by people who practice total mummification by duct tape regularly. They say it is like getting a ""HIGH"" without using drugs. Being wrapped tightly, and the total sensory deprivation (ear plugs inserted, blindfolds, etc) can give a sense of total euphoria.

I am not wacko or crazy. I am a nice, easy going, fun guy who found a new interest.

OK, here are the conditions:
I am married, you would have to host me. My wife is not into bondage.
We would have to meet and talk first to establish a mutual trust.
You would wrap me exactly as I want to be wrapped.
You would unwrap me at the end of the bondage session.
I will supply all materials needed for the procedure.

I HOPE SOMEONE WILL HELP ME ""WRAP THIS UP"" VERY SOON.

Hola everyone!

I'm an avid anime fan and I'm in the area of berkeley this week

I am planning to rent out a hotel room for the sake of holding an all day anime party with one person and me where we'd be down to watch anime, play board games, discuss and critique animes, and endulge in the free room service drinks that the hotel I book offers (they only offer free room service to rooms with two people or less)... So free drinks!

Animes I have on deck are :Digimon Tamers, Kill la Kill, Summer Wars. Clannad, Gate, No game no life, or whatever you'd recommend

You can also bring one friend over too so as long as they're an anime fan or love board gaming

Let's hang out and no worries you don't have to pay for the hotel room I'm booking I get a HUGE discount on it and it's so cheap anyway

You can help contribute to this party if you like, just propose it in the email, you can text me too!

-- Age 30-50
-- Educated (bachelor's degree or above)
-- Too much of a grammar/literacy nerd to engage in a lot of abbreviating
-- Somewhat brainy (interested in books, current events, art, etc.)
-- At least minimally interested in sports (playing and watching)
-- Flirty, but in a mature, compelling way
-- Level-headed and non-stalkery
-- Interested in periodic emailing throughout the day

Bonus points for the following:

-- Love NPR
-- Enjoy coffee/tea

I have been experiencing the desire to help those in need. Especially those who have been mentally ill and depressed. 

I've been mentally depressed and have battled against it since childhood. I know it comes with a feeling of emptiness and accompanied by the feeling of loneliness. If there was a map to mental depression, I couldn't find it. At times, I didn't even realize how I got to that point that was so low. I was lost and often unable to find the words to describe such a horrible place. It had to have been a place because I often stayed there until I was ready to come out.

Many times I would slip into depression after I was hurt and unable to continue fighting. I had no energy to sustain where I was at or where I was headed. My life became the reflection of my inside. I often worked 45+ hours a week, (plus commute), didn't cook for myself and often times dated people who could not receive or give love. (Objective view)

I think at my lowest point I had a short stay at a mental faculty where the only thing I'd allow myself to think was being present because death seemed more friendlier than this interior pain.

Still I chugged along, in and out of therapy. I think after one of my last dating fiasco I decided to do something simple and look for friendship. There is was online, on Craigslist and I posted a simple ad. I had a few replies, but this one raised my eyebrow.

This man had replied and said that I had contradicted myself in my ad. He said that in my words and my ads I was looking for truthful friendships and relationships but I had a too much makeup on and that my expression was an expression for the camera and not actual life.

Long story short he helped show me my own truth. It was not a conventional friendship, but it was a very life lesson friendship. He was me in the past. (Our birthdays were exactly 41 years)

Everyday I still learning about spirit. As my mind continues to think.

If you can understand any of this message, I may be able to help you. I think a lot of us don't know spirit and our mind can play many tricks on us. I would like to show you of you, you are in individual. You are made of two. Indivisible duo=individual. If you would like I can share with you my knowledge of the language and some of the 'secrets' it holds for us. Although the words do not have secrets it is our perception of the word that will make us overlook the obviousness of its definition. 

I hope if I can't help you, you will find your way!

I'm Jake, a 23 year old aspiring writer just looking to meet unconventional people. I don't feel like I fit in well with ""south bay"" culture, and I can't afford to move to anywhere else, so I was hoping to find some like minded people around me. I have a girlfriend in Berkeley but I don't get to be up there all the time so I'd like cool people to hang out with down here.

I'm white, 6'4'', had some college under my belt and a shit-ton of schooling in hard knocks. I'm not much into drinking, drugs, clubbing, cars or whatnot which seems like the majority of southbay folks. I'm an introvert, so sometimes I'm lower energy than I have reason to be, but for the right people I'd do anything to hang out!

Likes: I like hiking, going to write at coffee shops (I'm working on a few scripts, and a book right now, a pipedream I know but I just want to try it out) free music, well written fun movies, people watching, pickup soccer or football, and people who are easy to talk to.

Dislikes: Shallowness, feeling in the way, large crowds, one-sided conversations, ""we should hang out sometime in the vague and distant future"", feeling the center of attention.

If you want to hang out in a park, coffee shop, walking downtown, poolhall or anywhere else you can think of great! Put your hang-out idea in the subject line, or just the color of your eyes so I know you're real.

Hi there,

Want to talk? Want me to listen?

My name is Annette, and I offer free on-line counseling for those in need. I am not licensed but I do have a practitioner's certificate in Solution Focused Brief Therapy. I also have over 14 years of experience helping families come up with solutions to a number of various domestic concerns. 

I can offer an empathetic listening ear, and help brainstorm solutions if you like. Why am I offering free help? Well, first off I really care about people. Second, I would love to have the opportunity to help find realistic solutions for your concerns and problems at hand. I have a couple slots of time available in between my regular work and other projects. I would be honored to help share that time helping you. My goal is to bring peace into this world. Each of us can truly leave a positive imprint here on this planet. We can create a beautiful and peaceful ""new earth"" one healed soul at a time. 

This is all done primarily via email. On occasion over the phone depending on my daily schedule and availability. Weekends are usually best. 


Topics:
-relationships
-anxiety relief
-depression
-obsessive thinking
-purpose in life
-loneliness

Please reply via email and if you care to talk and I will respond as soon as I am able. 90 percent of the time within a few minutes/hours. Take care and hope to talk with you soon. 

All the best,
Annette

Hi,

I will be taking the California Bar next week, and hoping to wind down. My idea of winding down is to go out and dine somewhere in the Bay Area. While I may end up doing this alone, it would be nice to have an eating buddy for conversation. I can do the driving. You may be male or female--no romantic interests please.

My topics of interest:
* Universe (black holes, gravitational waves, universe expansion, etc.)
* Anime (Garo, Assassination Classroom, etc.)
* Countries (familiar with Japan and Taiwan)
* Business, politics (data privacy, current events)
* Computer games (will purchase it if I don't have it and it piques my interest)
* Movies (see above)
* Religion (I enjoy listening to beliefs from other perspectives)

If this sounds enticing, feel free to message me. Thanks!

Me 51, originally from England, recently relocated to the bay area from NY. Happily divorced and single. I work a lot and am careful not to let it define who I am but working that much makes it difficult to meet new people. Fit, fun, very intact if slightly warped sense of humor. Big positive appetite for life. 

Happy to share pics, talk on the phone and am open to meeting if it feels right.

Come On, Let's Go To A Movie

Beautiful night to get out of the house and meet a new friend.
Sooo, ...does a cup of coffee and a good movie sound like a good idea for the night, ??? ,...WELL,

Lets Go See One

So what do ya think? Any nice lady out there looking for a movie partner and or ,...even better, ...a new friend? :)~

And Hey,... this might just be a good excuse for two nice, decent human beings to say hello, ...and possibly even get acquainted, ....God forbid :)~


SO YES, This is as much about good company as it is a movie. 
Hell, probably even more about ""company"" depending on how things go.


So that's it, no need to sign on the dotted line, I won't ask for a bank account number, I don't need your credit card, I don't necessarily want or need your first born. ;)
Just a movie or a cup of coffee, Or maybe the grand slam,... Coffee, Conversation AND a Movie. Hhaaaaa, You thought I was gonna say something else. 😇

Joe



PS: Oh, and I never, ever, (EVER) thought I would have to say this, but a while ago a craigslist date got in my car and I knew she smelled of BO long before she was even fully in my car. I almost gagged. My Bad!!! I agreed to meet her w/out a picture and she lied about everything and totally ""catfished"" me!
Please be showered, clean, and an advocate of good hygiene.
If you are into perfume or yummy smelling women care products, that's a plus!!!
I do love, ""The Scent of a Woman.""

So long as it's not trying to cover BO, ...Ooooyyyy Veeeeyy!!!!


Also,...not a necessity, but if you don't mind could you please send a pic of yourself, as I have posted numerous of myself.  :)

Hello,

I'm bookish, a reader and thinker. I write stuff but not in an ego-driven, look-at-me way. I typically come across as quiet. I'm more frequently a pedestrian than a driver, go to libraries more often than bookstores. But I'm not seeking someone identical to myself.

""Ditch vision"" is apparently a term coined by an obscure poet (Jeremy Hooker) to refer to the predisposition to seek the miraculous and wondrous in small, mundane things. I identify with that. I guess I'm a practitioner of what you might call ""the new parochialism,"" seeking transcendence (to be transported) here at home, by what's local and specific -- within arm's reach or walking distance.

Anyway, I enjoy walking (wandering on foot), poetic reverie, philosophizing, reading out loud, and so forth. I also enjoy throwing a frisbee in a peaceful way; tennis too, possibly, though honestly it's been a while. And I run (jog) to keep fit.

If you enjoy any of the above, feel free to send me a message. Thanks.

Greetings ..... this ""old fart"" (white male, 58 years young), is seeking a sensual lady, for just an ""old fashion"" kind of ""make out session"" ..... the kind where sensual kissing and foreplay and touching ""might"" get me to ""first base"". I'm missing investing time of the playfulness with a lady, that use to happen when a boy and a girl went to the drive-in theater, and not caring what moving was playing, because ""she"" was the lead role. If any lady understands the kind of sensual playfulness that I'm seeking, please get back to me, so we can start sharing a journey together by sharing good conversation, along with some wonderful and sensual time together. Again, I'm not looking for ""sex"" (but, if one day in the future, we end up ""making love"" to each other, that's another story), but just the sensual encounter and all the wonderful feelings of sharing a fun ""make out session"" together.

Please be real and sincere (as there are too many fakes out here). If you really want to meet up, then be prepared to name me a location of a Starbucks (or other coffee house) where we can meet up in public, in a safe environment, in person (those who direct me to a web site, and meet up there . . ... SHALL BE IGNORED . . . as that is not meeting up in person). Also, since fake spammers and ""bots"" can never seem to name a location of a Starbucks (or other coffee house) where we can meet up, it's a way to week out the fake responses. And if you want ""age verification"", again, be mature enough to meet up in person, and you shall see that I'm not a 14/15 year old teenager. And if you're too scared to meet up in public, then don't even waste your time (and my time) by responding.

Lastly, I only respond to those who respond via simple e-mail notifications. If you respond via ""Google-Plus"", I will ignore those. Also, once you provide me with an e-mail address (such as a ""yahoo.com"", or ""gmail.com"" address), I will send even more photos . . . and remember, you can always make a new e-mail address for just you and me. Lastly, respond back to from the e-mail address where you want me to reply back to. If you say, ""write back to me at another address"", why don't you sign onto that address initially to reply to me . . . I'm not going to waste my time responding back to a new e-mail address each time you send me an e-mail.

SO . . . looking forward to hearing back from a mature lady, who is ready to share a sensual journey together, and I will respond back only to such a mature lady, who is ready to start sharing such a journey, by initially meeting up in public, at a Starbucks, or other coffee house

I'm not looking to hook up (you'll be sadly disappointed if that's your goal) and don't care if you're male or female. I'm just looking for a buddy who shares my love of top 40 hip hop, well drinks, and dancing very very badly. Let me know if you'd like to hang out tonight.

I would prefer to link up with a female climbing partner for the time being. I've climbed with many people over the years and I just prefer to focus on the climbing now and not the egos and competitiveness that male climbers typically bring with them.

Looking to meet a lady who would like a shopping buddy when buying heels. Either you buying or me buying. I've bought a few through the years, and I'm curious to see if there are ladies out there open minded in the idea of guys liking to wear heels as well. I have an idea of styles that I like as well.

I am straight. I'm not a CD to the extent that I would fully dress and do the make up, as I mainly like trying on heels and hosiery. It's not something I practice daily, moreso when I have an itch to wear. Whomever I meet, I would like to know that I have that confidence in telling a lady (who may be relationship potential) that I like wearing heels (and hosiery). But the idea that there is a lady who is open minded and understanding would be great. A plus is having the same shoe size (7.5).

If you're 25-35 and this piques your interest, drop me a line, and add your shoe size in the subject.

Thank you.

If you're a married man (or once were) or if you're in a long-term relationship with a woman and you'd like a discreet place to discuss your sexuality and form genuine friendships with similar men, please check out the ""Married/Once Married Men's Group"" that meets weekly at the Pacific Center in Berkeley. It's the only group of its type that meets in the Bay Area.

Although the group is primarily platonic, there have been times in the past when a long-term romance has developed between two members.

One thing the group is NOT is a place to find hook-up partners.

The group is anonymous and the confidentiality of all participants is protected. Current ""regulars"" range in age from 28 - 68 and the average number of attendees each week is nine. Meetings are every Wednesday night, from 8pm - 9:50pm. The Pacific Center is located at 2712 Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley.

I started attending more than three years ago when I was looking for feedback on coming out to my teenage kids. I didn't expect to attend more than once, but because the guys' feedback was so helpful, I returned to tell them how it went. I've been hooked ever since. I've found my tribe - there's no other social group like it. The dynamic is neither straight nor gay, it's somewhere in between.

I'm posting this information, not because the group needs more participants, but because it's a unique resource that hundreds of men have found invaluable throughout the group's 30+ year history.

The kind of conversation that leads to a really wonderful friendship,
the type of friendship that is very unique in its circumstance, one that brings with it a desire
to someday meet.

The meeting will be nice in the sense that the chemistry that was first felt through emails,
will be even more evident in real life. It will create this attraction....an undeniable feeling of
lust, desire, and infatuation. A feeling that is unique, the type that we are completely without in our lives.

We will create this mutual respect along with caring feelings that only you and I will understand.
Our thought of each other will be constant and bring with it smiles throughout our day. 
This change in our lives will allow us to be happy:) and to once again, live life contently.

Are we going to wait forever to experience the feelings of passion and desire again?
Are we going to have to stick our teeth in a glass of water before we can make-out again?
Will our walkers and canes become our new sex toys that we really don't even know how to use?
Can two people even fit on one of those electric scooter chair things without it tipping over in the street?
Is there even a back seat on them for making-out?
I don't want to change my depends, before making passionate love with someone I have a deep emotional connection with.
And, I never want Bingo to be my ""big date"" night either.

I am a healthy white male, in great physical shape. Smart. successful, completely drug and Viagra free......and I love to have fun.

We are a band of friends looking to expand our social circle. We are one female and two guys (one male is married to the female). Sometimes the circle gets bigger depending on the events but that is the main core of it. We are in our 30's, drama free, no kids, active and fit, funny, and very social. We are out of Oakland, will go anywhere in the bay area that offers fun activities, good entertainment, food, or drinks or all of the above. We are down to try new things and love to travel. This has nothing to do with sex so don't even ask! This is about being strictly friends and having a fun time.
Please tell us more about you. Looking forward to getting to know you.
Sincerely,
CR, DH, SRH

Hey Guys:

I'm a nice gay man and looking for ""Just Friends"". Yes, there is the Men Seeking Men section here on CL, but I'm NOT looking for a hookup. I'm looking for other nice, honest, drug free guys, either gay or straight to hang out with, go to a movie, get something to eat together, go for walks with me and my chihuahua named Sadie.

I am on full time disability due to a medical condition, so I do not work, but I went to school at UC Berkeley Adult Extension School and learned how to program databases using a software called Microsoft Access. I now provide database design services for extra money to use to enjoy myself with.

When I am home alone, I enjoy spending quality time with Sadie cuddling and loving her while we watch our favorite TV shows. A far as movies go, I am interested in all types of movies from action and adventure to love stories / romantic films. I would also be interested in going to see shows that are live on stage. I think there is a theater here in Berkeley called the Aroura Theater where they do live stage plays. When I was a kid, I lived in San Jose with my parents and we got season tickets to the The San Jose Civic Light Opera Theater and saw many big named stars in some really great performances. I would LOVE to do that again.

I am interested in meeting other mature acting guys, as I said, either straight or gay who also have a decent sense of humor so we can have a good time together laughing about whatever.........

I am totally open to learning all about you and YOUR personal interests, and who knows, I just might learn something new! After all, isn't that what a true quality friendship is all about is when you learn new things about your friends ?

I'm not necessarily that religious of a guy, but if you are, I am totally open to joining you at your church. If I had to choose, I would say that I believe in Christianity. And I would say that my personal feelings are that all the things in the Bible did not actually happen, but that they are simply stories that make moral points to help guide us in our daily lives. In other words, I do not believe that Moses actually parted the Red Sea, but that story just makes a point. 

YOU BE: 35-55yo, nice, have a good sense of humor, drug free, you don't take life too seriously, but yet you are a very responsible, law abiding guy.

Life is reasonably good but its often boring without a companion, more so during the weekends or holidays. I'm looking for someone who feels the same way, who is good at heart and interested in getting to know a friendly stranger, without any pressure or expectations. Your age or ethnicity doesn't matter much, what matters is your craving to have some fun in otherwise monotonous life..

A little something about me, I'm fun to be with, like to laugh & make others laugh, I don't play games, drama free, I like to try anything and everything at least once and have varied interests and hobbies. 

I don't want to know anything you don't want me to know, like where you live, how old you are, where you work, whether married or not, have kids or not or what not. We all have our baggage and so lets keep that aside for once and see what's on the other side. Will respect your limits and boundaries, whatever that may be...

Lets exchange few emails and take it from there. There is no obligation whatsoever. We won't exchange pictures until we are serious about each other and hear each others voice on the phone or skype so pic collectors pls excuse.

Getting right to the point this is not facebook...so looking for just friends only here is not the #1 goal. I'm realistic so only respond to me if you can be realistic too. I know most guys online want that 'one thing' on everyone's mind. But I'm different. Honestly I want to take things to the sexual level I'm looking for with you first THEN mix friendship in, to make sure we click on that friendship level after hooking up. I do things my way, not the ""normal"" way. Try to follow along. Why meet for regular ""dates"" just to immediately assume that you don't click with someone only because you're so nervous? 

I like to have fun like most guys on these personals but I also like having deep conversations and making actual progress with someone along the way. So no I do not want what others want for their secret agendas; I want a guy that I can get to know a little first over the phone, go to your house to talk and hook up ON THE FIRST MEET, then be prepared to more than potentially have an on-going friendship with benefits if it's there. I'm more than capable of being real friends with real benefits, and am strongly looking for a guy who can be ready enough to follow my lead.

For hanging out I like movies, hiking, shopping, definitely clubbing, can do video games, walking around town, going out to local eateries to avoid fast-food and more. I'm 5'9 tall, masculine, average to thicker/stocky body build, short hair casual attire. Sometimes classy when going out but still masculine. I'm down to earth, funny, open-minded, outspoken, etc. Please be single and not currently attached to someone like your ex. Save the complications.

I do not send face pics, and I am not into judging looks or appearance. Too many people with fake pics and phony intentions, or robots who are simply pic collectors. We can talk on the phone, connect then just meet in person because I have nothing to hide so why try to stop at pictures? In fact I find that the best connections come from not having high expectations off of looks. Instead of being shallow, just be attracted to a personality, not a picture/looks. Race isn't important to me; however I do like being interracial whether it be friendship or more.... Clearly you should feel the same way. I only expect replies from guys who are open-minded about any race. In example, I love Latinos and Asians (yum) but if someone other than that is ringing my bell, then it is what it is :) For the record I'm a top looking for a submissive bttm to be down with who loves sex...and you be able host when we go further or for plan B in the car somewhere parked because I cannot host. Like under the stars chillin'.

Keeping in touch is key...We all have busy lives--you ARE NOT the only one with a busy schedule. If you say you want to meet, just fucking make the time for it and keep the plans. Or else stay the fuck offline. I cannot stress that enough. And back to pictures, it's annoying to exchange pictures with guys who can't follow through or keep the momentum going...if you're claiming to want even just a friend you should already have the time for them. By the way there's no sure way to tell if someone is a match on day 1. Real chemistry doesn't happen in 5 seconds, it happens over time after discovering there are general mutual interests. I want a guy who's prepared to meet with me a few different times before judging any chemistry.

The only real preference for FWB I have is age...I need a guy around my age who can keep up with me. So 18-29 hmu. But since it's a preference not a requirement, older guys feel free to be bold and hmu if you think we can still be good together :)

For me, it's being free in nature, surrounding myself with the fresh air, and taking in all that nature has to offer. It can also be a spiritual-healing moment for many who are searching for something more.

Common activities include:
- home gatherings (movies, games, food)
- outdoor activities (nature walks, nudist beaches, camping, hiking, etc)
- urban exploring (google if you do not know what this is)
- clothing-optional hot springs (tecopa, saline valley, death valley)

Please include a photo of yourself in your kitchen when you respond (weeds out spambots and pervs who can't read). I'll gladly respond in kind if true, or delete if no photo. I also request that we meet in person before joining our small group as this is a trusted circle and we only let in those who truly seek the nudist lifestyle (vs those who are in it for sex). This helps calm any jitters and allows us to be ourselves without proving anything.

Hope to hear from you soon. Cheers! :-)

P.S. This is not an ad for casual sex. Pervs and the like will be reported.

I weight 240.5 (cant forget .5 right?). When i got out of the Army i weighed aprox. 130lbs., with an eight pack and i look DAMN good, i was also 23; I am now 35 (well will be on Jan. 8th) and i dont wanna be fat anymore. 

I used to be power lifter, well an amatuer one, i didn't lift for anyother reason except to get stronger, i did, but then i got hurt at work, i ballooned from 205lbs. to 204.5lbs., and weak (well weaker than i was, but probably stronger than most). 

I can lift again, i can run again, and most importantly i want to, however it is boring; yes, i can go to the gym for six hours a day, and then walk my dogs for an hour, and inbetween make specific meals (im a Chef; well now dont you feel lucky?) and then sleep for six and...well etc. etc. (it's etc. NOT ect. btw) and i'll lose the weight, and look damn good (i look pretty good now, but perfection can always be perfected...i know, i have high self-esteem, but i promise im not an asshole nor conceited, just self-assured), but it'll get boring and who knows how long it'll last before i go back into my old, lazy ways, 

SO...i am on here (not a bad place btw, but very, VERY eye-opening, and a little weird in certain spots - not saying weird is bad -) trying to find someone who wants to sweat, and work, and moan and groan with me, and as i stated in the subject line : ""those who sweat together, sweat in other ways together"", and im sure i don't have to specific to relay what i'm saying.

Currently my workout schedule is wideopen, as i still am on Workers Comp., but if i had my druthers, i'd perfer to workout early, early in the AM or late in the evening ie. 3/4am or 10/11pm, HOWEVER i can do it during the day too. I just know that when i go back to work, ill have to change the schedule and i work 0700-1500 in San Leandro, so doing it early in the AM ie. 3/4am would be kick-ass.

The actual workout schedule would simple: running, lifting weights, walking, push-ups/situps, swimming (yes in the winter too) and maybe even some console workouts ie. Wii fitness (i don't actual have this game, but i do do console workouts, why, because they're fun and they make you laugh.

As far as what i'm looking for, i am looking for someone to go on this path me; where it takes us, that's yet to be seen. Maybe we'll just be workout partners, maybe we'll fall in love and maybe...well there's a lot of inbetween, but let's start off with your name (my name is Jacob btw) and coffee.

Hi, there,

I'd like to talk to people who share a common world-view related to:

natural health rather than the medical industry's idea of it,

openness to subjects like auras, telepathy, energy healing, and synchronicities but not religious or New Age,

debunking propaganda that's so ubiquitious on the news and reading research in depth with healthy skepticism and serious attention to its funding and layers of possible deception,

a playful sense of humor and lightness to create fun rather than just focusing on the world problems.

If after talking it seems like we'd really resonate in person, it could be fun to go dancing to cheap live music, go to the art museum - I have a membership, watch movies, go for walks, to organic restaurants or cook together, share our artistic pursuits with each other, maybe even make funny video shorts if you have a camera, or just hang out and talk. Not looking for either of us to spend much money on our entertainment. 

Please don't ask me to text as I don't use a cell phone. Feel free to include a photo.

Just what it says on the tin. Need advice from someone anonymous on the Internet, who has experience in my field

So I graduated law school in 2014. I didn't know it at the time, but I was beginning to be overwhelmed by the tidal wave of bipolar disorder and clinical depression. I had been experiencing the onset of these illnesses for years, but it really came to a breaking point during my law school years. To cut the story short, I completely crashed upon graduating law school. I couldn't hold it together anymore, and consequently have spent the past 2 years trying to figure out just what exactly is my diagnosis (I now have it - bipolar II) and how to manage it.

In that time, I haven't passed the bar, haven't been able to work, haven't been able to do anything but struggle with these demons. It has been a difficult time.

Now as 2016 begins, I'm finally starting to feel like a human being again. And I want my life back. I had a dream to be a lawyer, but now I don't know how to grasp for it or where to start. I have to take the bar exam in June, which will be the Uniform Bar Exam, and then convince a law firm to hire me...but I have no idea how to explain away two blank years on my resume, bad law school grades due to mental illness, and a useless liberal arts background prior to law school. I know I have brains - I got a 170 on the LSAT, which I took just before my mental illness started to really shatter me - but I've learned the hard way that brains aren't enough.

I'm not here looking for someone to give me a job or anything like that. I would just really appreciate some advice and guidance from attorneys who might know what steps I need to take to make myself employable. I did have a dream of working in corporate law, and I actually really loved learning about transactional work in law school, but I am unsure about how to market myself to those big firms. 

Anyway, if you feel like responding, I'd love to hear any pearls of wisdom. If not, thanks for reading anyway. :)

The truth is much of my life takes place doing simple things like making dinner, taking long drives,enjoying the sun and, when it does, the rain. I find a way to enjoy each moment of simplicity by belting out songs on the radio while driving. What I miss is quiet time to just recharge my batteries. Life is too short to take everything so seriously, so I try to take it in stride and take each moment as it comes. I tend to have a witty (sometimes sarcastic) sense of humor, so anyone I meet needs to be able to keep up and not be easily offended. I'm looking for someone to spend quality times with, because everything is more enjoyable and memorable when you have someone to share them with.

Are you someone that knows when the moment is serious and can engage appropriately?
How to ""summarize"" oneself or another in a clearly delineated box? The odds of finessing this successfully are slim to none. But here I am and there you have it. At once, infinitely complex and multidimensional and simple at my core, as I think we all are. I am at home and happy in my own skin. Do you find yourself in a similar place? Drawn to those with passions and creative pursuits that fuel and feed them, I find that this life and this world offers immense opportunity for childlike wonder, explosions of pure creativity, eruptions of infinite bliss, and a potent affinity for the absurd amidst all of it.

I am a very curious person and this curiosity manifests itself through travel. New cultures and environments fascinate me and I thrive on meeting new people and learning about their cultures. It's exciting for me to explore and learn about the world and would love to meet someone who enjoys this as well.

I am the kind of person who stays and read the credits at the end of a movie; will let a person cut in front of me at the grocery store if they have just a couple of items to buy, believe in paying it forward and karma. Volunteering is important to me

I have no ulterior motive or agenda. I'm an adult and I expect the same from my partner. Can smoothly transition from most situations with ease (and style), which I hear is a plus.

I am verbal, congenial, and halal. OK, I don't really keep halal. But I liked the rhyme. I love freedom of expression in all forms

So what do you think? Want to give this a whirl?

I am an avid outdoors person and a safe, experienced climber. Unfortunately, my regular climbing partners have all moved away one by one due to the economy and other reasons. I have not climbed regularly in a while but wish to begin climbing seriously again. I prefer to climb outdoors and intend to get outside as much as possible as the weather permits but will happily climb in a gym when outside is not an option. I would prefer to link up with a female climbing partner for the time being. I've climbed with many people over the years and I just prefer to focus on the climbing now and not the egos and competitiveness that male climbers typically bring with them. (This mainly as well as I just simply enjoy the company of women!) I have taught many first timers from boy scout troops to friends of friends so don't be afraid to respond, all skill levels welcome.

For a while, I've been developing a series cannabis infused oils as external ointments, (but they are quite edible), to be used as lip-balms and or skin ointments. All of these ointments have a very mild sedative effect, but there's no way that they could considered euphoric. But recently I've developed something a lot more potent. From several reports that I've received so far it seems to supercharge the libido and kick the horny factor into overdrive.

Now I need more women to use their vaginas to advance the frontiers of hedonistic research All that you would have to do at first is try massaging a teaspoon of the salve inside your vagina and around your clitoris, (I'm assuming you'd try some under your tongue first so as to assure yourself of it's safety and well as effectiveness) and then wait about 15 minutes. Then play with yourself and/or your partner. We'll adjust the formula using the results of your test. There will be absolutely no pressure on you to have me as your sex partner. I doubt you'd find me an adequate partner anyway. I'm 63 years old, partially disabled and have a big-time heart condition. Not only am I, almost by definition a lousy fuck, but fucking would probably kill me.

You must a valid ID proving that you're 18+ years of age and have a valid medical marijuana card in order for me to give you 1/2 oz.(2~4 doses), of this lubricant. Other than that it's a free trip.... Just tell me what you think about it.

Fit, funny, and a bit sarcastic, married realist on the handsome and skinny side of 45 seeking fellow fit, feisty mom for early morning running/jogging in Baylands and streets. 

Just looking to fill the social/mental gaps while getting my endorphin high. I joke around a lot better with women than men, and I need a partner to force me outta bed. (insert oneliner and rimshot here.) Wifey doesn't run, and we both agree that having some separate friend/activity circles is a healthy longterm life plan. As for you being partnered, too... I'm just guessing we would have more chat fodder if you have a hubby and/or kids to complain about or bounce reactions back at me. Common ground makes for a good running partner... hehe, get it? 

Serious exercisers only, though... this is legit for running slash peer pressure slash looking good slash having some laughs. Not racing. Just mellow/moderate pace, but 2 mile endurance or more would be optimal. 

I don't care what kind of shoes you have, as long as your feet are fleet and your attitude is in the right place. Look good, feel good, laugh. No judgment.

Not a huge fan of the Dish crowds, but I can hang if Stanford's your preference. Just make it worth my while and have some good stories to tell: kids, work, vacation, parties.

Short email conversing period required, just to confirm compatibility and lack of kook. Let me know if you're balancing on the life slackrope of life, and how to make this fit your fitness goals.

When a couple friend of mine was going through a rough time in their marriage, someone suggested that they go through couples therapy. Not the usual boring dribble in a specialists office, but in the bedroom. It was the best thing that happened to their marriage.

I was the lucky therapist. Though I did not actively participate in sex, I would tell them what to do. We ended up tearing the artificial boundaries that they had created between them and made them feel intimate again. I would say ""slide her panties to the side and go down on her"" or ""lick him from the balls to the tip"". I made them say and do things that they had stopped saying or doing. They say it saved their marriage.

I just got out of a long term relationship about a month ago and I am realizing I have no friends which sucks. I have a good amount of free time, but always find myself having no one to chill with. I guess over the duration of my relationship I lost relationships because I was always preoccupied with my bf at the time. Now that we aren't together/ don't live together, I feel like such a loner. Lol. I got so used to always having his company especially since we lived together. 
I'm looking for other girls who are similar to me or want a new friend too. I want to make friends again because I miss going out and living my life and doing the things I like without having a significant other or someone ""holding me back."" I've forgotten how great it is to be single. Therefore I wanna hang out with some chicks n enjoy life.
I'm 21 and on my last semester of college (graduate Spring).
I'm a Latina. I enjoy cooking. I recently chose to cut out meat from my diet so that has been interesting. I have a med card and love smoking/ so I would like a friend who can smoke with me whenever. I like running/ going to the gym. I used to do it just so I could eat what I want, but now I actually wanna be fit. I'm funny, chill, not into drama, love listening to and sharing music. I read a lot bc of school/ literature major, I like drinking/ bars, exploring SF with a blunt.

...a stranger to take a chance on meeting?
It's not easy, let me tell you. 
And what if one has a desire to perform acts (or have acts performed on them) that don't conform with the ""normal"" means of making friends?
You see, I'm not one to make small talk. I'm not well versed in the art of pick-up. Yet I know what I like and want, and yes, I know how to give and please. It's just that I'm not very good at chatting about inconsequential, meaningless things. I prefer deep, probing conversations and intimate physical contact.
Of course we can talk, joke, and get to know each other. But ultimately I want to massage you. Explore you. Experiment with you. Just as I want to be massaged, explored, and experimented with.
People are into so many things, so many acronyms. Edging. BDSM. CFNM. Swinging. Tantra. Voyeurism. Exhibitionism. Anal. Oral. Tech. Hentai. 420. GB. ...on and on. We all have our kinks and fetishes.
This is where I find myself at this moment - I'm curious, feeling the need to experiment and try new and exciting things.
I'm on a quest for Discovery. I seek to discover people, sensations, experiences, boundaries, women. Women in all their glory.
So tell me...what excites you? What intrigues you? Be it sexual, intellectual, emotional, physical or spiritual, I would like to hear about it and possibly experience it with you

Need to get back into shape and it would be much more enjoyable with a friend for some motivation and to pass the time better.

Hi there!

I'm looking for local girlfriends who live in Mountain View or very near to. Most of my friends live somewhat far away and I would love to make more friends closer to home! Weekdays are best for me, I get very busy on the weekends. 

About me:
I just turned 30, I will be married in four months to the love of my life. I love making new friends and socializing. I love drinking coffee. My friends tend to describe me as being fun, but I know when to take things down a notch and be serious too. I'm not afraid to dance when no one else is. I love to sing karaoke. I love fashion, and own my own business selling designer clothing on eBay. I have a theater background. As a side job, I occasionally work at Stanford school of medicine as a standardized patient, which is basically an acting job to help medical students get out of their textbooks and learn how to talk to patients. I am girly, but a tomboy at heart.

I am a very outgoing person. My personality is very bubbly and happy. I am a Libra, if that means anything to you! My most compatible friendships are usually Leos, Sagittarians, Libras, Gemini and Aquarius. If you happen to be one of those signs, you should totally contact me! (NOT required though, lol!) If that weirded you out, then you probably shouldn't contact me. :P

Fav bands: Florence and the Machine, Beats Antique
Fav movies: I have a lot but to list a few- Moulin Rouge, Lion King, Lord of the Rings, Mary Poppins, Hook, Harry Potter, Back to the Future 
Fav shows: Again, I have a lot, but I will say that I love Doctor Who, Pushing Daisies and Futurama. I like a lot of different shows, for example I just finished watching Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and now I am starting Downton Abbey. It depends on my mood!

I love to learn, I love to read, I love to take walks, I listen to classical music for relaxation, I love to laugh most of all! Life is too short, so I try to live it!

If you live in Mountain View and I didn't scare you off so far, then send me an email! Please tell me more about yourself, it's only fair :P

Talk to you soon, my friend!

I some help understanding something. I'm sure it's a people issue but my recent and past experience has been with women. That's why I'm posting here, looking for perspective. Have you ever known someone that gives so much of herself to people that continue just taking or are constantly needing something? Here is my situation: I'm a very independent guy. Meaning, I don't really need a lot in terms of support, affirmation or so forth. If I'm seeing someone I want their attention simply because if I'm dating them, I really do like them. I had an ex that always went out her way to help out anyone that asked. That could be spending time, loaning money or other efforts. It got to the point where it affected our relationship when she would seemingly drop me to be there for her friend in need. It was a problem because most of her friends where in need of something. It was crazy because she seemed to feel more connected to someone the more they helped them, regardless if it interfered with her own well-being. I just recently experienced that again with a girl in a similar lifestyle. What blows me away is that they both said how easy it was with me. They were both always so at ease when we were together. When we were together, things were amazing but when we weren't, they were bad because they were stressing or completely preoccupied with whatever friend was in need. I will say too, that it wasn't always someone in ""need"" it was also things like these people were the ones who planned everyone's birthday or other get together and really had to go all out even if they just met or barely knew someone. I don't expect all of someone's time. I know people have lives before they met me. Typically there's a good balance when I date someone and they aren't surrounded by people in constant need. 
So, do I have issues or is it something lacking in their lives? I consider myself a nice guy and I help out friends and I'm there for them but I don't let it affect my happiness. Maybe that's what truly makes them happy but I don't see that. They're stressed, some broke and seem to feel obligated. I just don't get it. Let me know your thoughts.

Hello All!

I'm a 28 year old female graduate student who is currently looking for a gym partner. I'm hoping to find another woman around my age (6 yrs in either direction is fine by me!) who is looking to get in shape. I'm looking to lose about 70-100lbs, and would love to work out and build a friendship with a motivated woman with a similar amount of weight to lose. 

I'm currently a member of 24 hour fitness, so you would need to be one too or willing to become one. I would like to go to the gym 2 times a week to start, and am hoping to go on Mondays and Wednesdays- we can discuss times once we meet. I'm up for cardio, strength training, swimming, and group classes! Relaxing in the sauna or getting some tea after the gym to chat and catch up would be great as well. 

I would love it if we could go to the 24 in Union City near Target. If you're interested, please respond to this with a piece of gym equipment or class you'd like to learn to use or try out in the title. In your email tell me a bit about yourself and your goals, perhaps give me a link to one of your social media sites (Instagram or Facebook is preferred, no judgement if you don't utilize social media). We can then set up a time to grab tea and see if we'd like to try becoming gym partners. 

I'm open to more than one person as well so if you have a friend, or are open to meeting up with others who respond to this email, even better!!!

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Hi all - 

As many times as I've tried this, I've had little luck with finding other moms who are GENUINELY interested in getting together for play dates, mom night outs, etc. And I really want to think I'm not the only mom out here who'd enjoy some other female companionship.

I am a 27 year old, married mommy of a 4 year old boy with baby boy #2 on the way :) I am educated, employed, opinionated, meat-eating, west coast transplant (from the east coast), honest, non-judgmental, ambitious, mouth like a sailor, 420 & drink friendly and tattooed. 

I'd love to plan outings and get togethers from park playdates, to fairs / festivals, groupon/ livingsocial activities, weekend trips, camping, shows, sitting at home doing nothing lol anything goes really - we're open and flexible!

I'm hoping to find at least ONE other mommy who feels the same and is willing to make time to create a true friendship! I have an entrepeurnial spirit and it would be awesome if you did too so we could bounce ideas off each other and brainstorm? heated political debates? there is no topic that is taboo for me. In the near future, I'd also like a workout buddy to lose this baby weight - I'm most interested in boxing / kickboxing & zumba - but def open to other things...

I ask very little from mom friends but to be yourself and non-judgmental - if based on my info you don't think we'd get along - then don't reply - simple as that. I understand we're all busy and I'm not a fan of wasting either of our time. If you're attached, great! If not, that's fine too. 

If any of this sounds at all interesting to you then let me know and I'll respond asap. I go on maternity leave soon so I'll have some time...Hope to hear back soon!

Hello!

I will start by noting that this ad is cross-posted in both this forum, as well as the M4W section. This seems to be the best way to cover the bases relative to what I'm looking for. I'm seeking something more on the platonic level first, but I'm open to a deeper relationship down the road if we really click.

Busy professional here, looking for enjoyable times with an interesting and down-to-earth female companion.

Some basics about me: SWM, late-40s, 6', HWP, INTJ, non-smoker, well-educated, easy-going with a great sense of humor, never married, and no kids. I've been through my share of moves, domestic and international travel, jobs, and relationships, and have developed a well-rounded perspective on the world-at-large. I would now like to find a compatible female companion to share the happenings around here and see what develops. Movies, music, dining, art, museums, and day hikes/trips are good ways to get me out of the house.

Please write back if any of this initially intrigues you. I'm open some email time before we meet, so don't feel as though you have to provide your life story on the first go-around (but no one-liners). A picture or two would also be great, but if you would like to correspond a little bit first, I am OK with that. I'll do likewise. I'm just seeking solid, genuine, interesting companionship to help ease the pressures of Silicon Valley life.

Thanks for reading my post!

Working from home is an irony -- in principle it should be super-productive, stripped of the distractions of an office, freed of the need for a time-sapping commute. But it rarely lives up to the promise. External distractions give way to internal distractions. The irony of deep loneliness in the middle of a crowded city. It helps to get out of the house and to a public space, which I'll probably do soon.

Anyway, if anyone wants to distract me with an email I'll respond.

I really enjoy going to this coed nude spa in hunters point. It's an one of a kind place where you could bath and relax nude with people of all genders and ages and body types. However I don't have anyone to go with, so I feel quite alone when I go and wonder if anyone is interested in going with me. 
The place is at: http://banyasf.com

Do you need a place that you can escape to? I have my own place. Maybe we can watch a movie, play cards, share stories, or lounge around. I you can escape from your worries and daily routines. I am a genuine friend who you can lean on. Not many of those are around. People grow up, grow apart, or become too busy that we forget the ones who used to be there. I have no age preferences but I'm not into smokers or druggies. If you would like to start a new found friendship send me a message. Make sure you have your life in order, stable, positive attitude, kind, and know how to be a friend. I am hwp, funny, and laid back.

Fit, funny, and a bit sarcastic, married realist on the handsome and skinny side of 45 seeking fellow fit, feisty mom for early morning running/jogging in Baylands and streets. 

Just looking to fill the social/mental gaps while getting my endorphin high. I joke around a lot better with women than men, and I need a partner to force me outta bed. (insert oneliner and rimshot here.) Wifey doesn't run, and we both agree that having some separate friend/activity circles is a healthy longterm life plan. As for you being partnered, too... I'm just guessing we would have more chat fodder if you have a hubby and/or kids to complain about or bounce reactions back at me. Common ground makes for a good running partner... hehe, get it? 

Serious exercisers only, though... this is legit for running slash peer pressure slash looking good slash having some laughs. Not racing. Just mellow/moderate pace, but 2 mile endurance or more would be optimal. 

I don't care what kind of shoes you have, as long as your feet are fleet and your attitude is in the right place. Look good, feel good, laugh. No judgment.

Not a huge fan of the Dish crowds, but I can hang if Stanford's your preference. Just make it worth my while and have some good stories to tell: kids, work, vacation, frustration.

Short email conversing period required, just to confirm compatibility and lack of kook. Let me know if you're balancing on the life slackrope of life, and how to make this fit your fitness goals.

Also it is a shame that I have to state this too but I am only looking for women who were born women and women who are single and not married or in a relationship. I the type of guy who will give you attention like text you out of nowhere or have fun and funny conversations and trust me if I was in your life you would be laughing whenever you talked to me or laughing about what I said the last time you talked to me.

I am 6'2 stocky thick build brown chocolate skin brown eyes full lips deep voice facial hair big hands and feet no tattoos only my ears pierced. I don't sag my pants and I always wear a belt and I always like to smell good whenever I leave the house. I don't discriminate on anybody so I like all races of women and I don't care about age as long as you're over 18.

Hi guys, girls or small groups of friends. I need help experiencing a new fantasy I want to try. After being wrapped in a base of plastic wrap (Saran wrap), I want to be wrapped, head to toe, like a mummy, in duct tape. 

I found videos, on the internet, of people being mummified in duct tape. I found it extremely exciting, and I want it to be done to me. Obviously, I cannot do it myself. So, I need willing volunteers who would have fun wrapping me up in duct tape. 



I read blogs, online, by people who practice total mummification by duct tape regularly. They say it is like getting a ""HIGH"" without using drugs. Being wrapped tightly, and the total sensory deprivation (ear plugs inserted, blindfolds, etc) can give a sense of total euphoria.

I am not wacko or crazy. I am a nice, easy going, fun guy who found a new interest.

OK, here are the conditions:
I am married, you would have to host me. My wife is not into bondage.
We would have to meet and talk first to establish a mutual trust.
You would wrap me exactly as I want to be wrapped.
You would unwrap me at the end of the bondage session.
I will supply all materials needed for the procedure.

I HOPE SOMEONE WILL HELP ME ""WRAP THIS UP"" VERY SOON.

Don't know why I'm posting as I know I won't get a response but here's to trying.

So I don't have much friends, not really anyone close to talk to. Although I'm in a committed relationship, I feel an empty void which ceases any motivation to do anything new. Am I just settling? 

I wish I can find a nice pen pal or even good female friend. A best friend. A gym partner to motivate health, A geeky girl for gaming entertainment, a realist to converse with. Share stories, share opinions, and most of all a guide to life. 

I don't know what I'm doing but I'm letting life respond...

I've tried other places, and dating websites to find new friends. But things never work out as they are either interested in dating, or don't believe when I say I'm looking for a friend.

Also if you're interested in chatting or miss the old instant messaging days. Message me on kik oxy1984.

Hey there!

Are you also involved with someone, who at one time may have been exciting but no longer is? Not just sexually (though that may be a big deal for you), but emotionally? Have you drifted apart, yet stay together for your own reasons? Would you like to commiserate sometime over coffee? I'm buying! 

But seriously, I'm a handsome (maybe I'm bias), tall, average-built, also involved, 40-something, looking for a similar ""ear"" to share stories and even secrets with. I'm witty, intelligent, very cordial and considerate, love probing questions, and enjoy deep conversations -- especially the most controversial subjects.

I have no bounds, but my objective is NOT to have sex with you (unless of course we absolutely have to). Intimacy is a very interesting thing and can only truly be enjoyed when an emotional connection is made. Let's just leave that part out (for now) and see what happens . . . 

PS ... I won't hold you responsible for not liking me, physically or otherwise. We are complex creatures and like what we like. The end. :) 

Please say hello! 

I am 100% real and serious. You should be, too. And bots/prostitutes: DO NOT ask me to ""verify"" myself on your ""free"" site. I've not raped or killed anyone, nor have I thought about raping or killing anyone - ever, but thank you for your efforts. ;)

I'm a 31 year old (single, white, if that matters) guy who lives a busy (work)life. I'm a heavy set guy (284lbs, 6'1"") and I have been gaining weight a lot lately due to inactivity and unhealthy eating habits. I live in the city and I work in tech industry as a software engineer. I really love my job and that kinda makes me a bit of a workaholic. I don't have much of a life outside of work which often manifests as me staying at the office at late hours. When I'm not working I like to read books(mostly sci-fi), watch tv shows, go to movies, play xbox, catch up on science and technology. When I manage to take time off from work, I really like going for walks around the city and hike the coastal trails.

I'm looking for someone who is in a similar life situation. Basically if any of the following applies:
- busy life and struggles to keep weight down
- makes excuses for not exercising
- really want to get healthy but need a push and someone to motivate you
- are already healthy and/or fit, but would like someone to work on and motivate

I don't care if you're married, in a relationship or single. I would really like to stress that I am not looking for a romantic relationship of any kind and I am not hoping this to develop into anything more than a friendship. No ""casual"" encounters or anything like that. One thing I do ask is that if you are in a relationship or in a marriage and your partner tends to be jealous kind, I'd ask you to skip this ad. I am all about no drama, and I do not want to spend time making excuses or doing things in secret because of your partner.

What I am looking for is an activity partner for walking, hiking, gym and/or just exploring the city. Basically I would like to find someone I could make plans with to go for walks and have an excuse to not stay at work so late. :)

Just send me a mail and we can get to know each other a little better and go for a coffee or something. I'm not a creep and I'd also like to verify that you're not one, so meeting in a public place first would be ideal.

Hate going it alone or would love to have some company and conversation for outing, activities or adventures? Same here...

Not looking for anything more than a new friend, good company and conversation, someone who'd like to do things together. Not opposed to it growing into more but far more interested in having the company and friend and keeping it uncomplicated.

I'm smart, witty at times, a white collar professional, a good conversationist most of the time and generally know as fun to be around (I hope). I'm easy on the eyes, attractive even. I'm easy going and keep things light - understand the value of just having a good conversation and time.

I'm looking for someone who would enjoy what I have to offer and offer much of the same. If you're the kind of person who says ""ask me anything"" or I've got to pry it out of you, that's not my thing. I'll do my share, you do yours.

I appreciate a walk in the park or the beach and a cup of coffee as much as I would a glass of wine or dinner. Maybe a standing date to do something once a week, or even nothing and just a chat over coke. 

Please respond with enough to share who you are and what you might like to do.

No drugs, smokers, married men and one liners. A general preference for someone my age (40-50 range).

Hi there thanks for clicking on my ad.

I'm a hoarder and it makes me very embarrassed and ashamed. Since I'm uncomfortable inviting people over or even letting them know about my situation, it makes me distance myself from people, afraid of being rejected by them if they were ever to find out. But that also makes me very lonely, and even though I sometimes think that no one could accept me for this one thing, I believe that I do have qualities that I could offer someone, kind, caring, affectionate, reasonably intelligent, not unattractive (I guess, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, my exes thought I was attractive). I think it also makes it harder being gay too. Gay guys have the stereotype of being super tidy and put together. I'm not either of those. 

I know it probably sounds like I'm looking for something romantic, and I'm not opposed to it, but I'm posting in Strictly Platonic because I really am just trying to find people who are supportive and can help me, people that'll show me that there are people out there that won't run away if they find out I'm a hoarder. 

If you made it this far, thanks so much for reading. Sorry it's such a long ad. If you feel that you'd be willing to reach out and help me, that would be great. Thanks!

Just love that song. Can't feel depressed after hearing it. It's the best Beatles song because it's impossible from listening to it to know who wrote it. With the Beatles, usually the lead singer is also the writer. On ""She Loves You,"" McCartney and Lennon both sing a harmonized lead. In fact, they both played a hand in writing it, unlike many of their other songs, which were written by one or the other. For a group that was so much more than the sum of its parts, ""She Loves You"" exemplifies what made the Beatles great.

You could comment on that or just put into the subject line something you'd like to talk about. I'm into music, films, politics, money, etc. Often bored, always looking to converse.

Hi there,

Want to talk? Want me to listen?

My name is Annette, and I offer free on-line counseling for those in need. I am not licensed but I do have a practitioner's certificate in Solution Focused Brief Therapy. I also have over 14 years of experience helping families come up with solutions to a number of various domestic concerns. 

I can offer an empathetic listening ear, and help brainstorm solutions if you like. Why am I offering free help? Well, first off I really care about people. Second, I would love to have the opportunity to help find realistic solutions for your concerns and problems at hand. I have a couple slots of time available in between my regular work and other projects. I would be honored to help share that time helping you. My goal is to bring peace into this world. Each of us can truly leave a positive imprint here on this planet. We can create a beautiful and peaceful ""new earth"" one healed soul at a time. 

This is all done primarily via email. On occasion over the phone depending on my daily schedule and availability. Weekends are usually best. 


Topics:
-relationships
-anxiety relief
-depression
-obsessive thinking
-purpose in life
-loneliness

Please reply via email and if you care to talk and I will respond as soon as I am able. 90 percent of the time within a few minutes/hours. Take care and hope to talk with you soon. 

All the best,
Annette

To keep a long story relatively short I got my morning shift called off so I am free and looking for a smoke buddy to come over and get smoked out no strings just two people getting to know each other. I am open to it being more than platonic but I am mainly just seeking some smoke company right now.I am pretty good looking and aged on the fit scale. My roommate's will be back at some point after 1 I can meet after that but the probability I can host will be less my roommates aren't too fond of 420. Anyways if your interested no pic needed just send me your stats and I will respond with my address, I honestly am pretty high already so looking to make this as simple as humanly possible haha.

Need to get back into shape and it would be much more enjoyable with a friend for some motivation and to pass the time better. 

Im a 31 year old caucasian male, not out of shape, just need to get my wind back and strengthen up a bit. Would be nice if you were in the Foster City, San Mateo area or close to that.

I have no idea if this will work, but here goes nothing :-) I am a single mid-30s female and I am expecting a baby in the next year. Many of my friends are without kids or the ones who have them are far away. I am a straight woman, just looking to meet other moms in hopes that we can hang out with our kids on fun outings and help each other out when needed. It doesn't matter to me if you're single or in a relationship. Prefer someone relatively close by (anywhere in the east bay is great) and with young kids. I am hoping to build a nice community of mothers where we know each other and our kids grow up together. If this appeals to you, hit me up :) Thanks and have a great day!

HELLO,
....This a real post, from a real guy, with real questions.....Not desperate, just confused.....
........So, I want to know the truth about a few things I have been wondering about lately! I said, Hey let me throw it on Craigslist, because lots of people are on Craigslist and many different women get on Craigslist, so maybe I can get a collective value of opinions to go with and then I will know what the hell is going on?.....
.......My hope is women who are Single, married, separated or in a relationship will give their real opinion and be able to help out an attractive, fun and real guy who is wondering where the all the attractive, fun and real women have gone here in the Portland area
.......Okay so, what happened to all the women who are attractive, fun and real in the Portland and surrounding areas? There used to be so many! Women who loved life, lived life and did not sweat the small stuff, who were fun, adventurous, honest, real as hell and were also looking, wanting and hoping to meet and get to know men that were the same way?......Seems like most have ended up getting married or moving away. Or just turned to fake, to serious, drama filled men haters....LOL!......Seriously!!!......
.......I am a fun guy, have my shit together, attractive, love to laugh and joke around, fun as hell with alot to offer in every way. Country boy with a little city, I guess you can say a bad boy, without the bad man persona. Love life, work hard, know how to treat a women, affectionate, smart, and I have been told a kick ass guy!When it comes down to it, I am single and ready to meet someone cool, to just hang out with and get to know, no expectations, and see what could happen and where it may go!!! It used to be easy to meet women who wanted the same, and were actually real, honest and fun as hell.......
....Now it seems what we are meeting are women who are stressed, unhappy, no effort or time it takes to get to know someone, fake as hell and just not fun!...Not in any way am I saying all women we have met or that are out there, are like that or have been that way, but the percentage has been pretty high in the last few months and I and we are just wondering why???.......
......Are there any women out there that believe in friends first? Or women that are interested in good men who they can have fun with, get to know and are open to the possibilities????.........
**********************************************************************************
........So, women of any age (Age is just a number) who have an opinion, advice, a thought or feeling about any of this. Maybe women who are looking for the same and feel the same way as I and we do, but about men? Maybe women who can give the inside scoop, maybe what you see or just want to throw out their belief of what or where the real and fun women may be. Feel free to shoot a message or two! All I ask is for real women, with real opinions, that think they just may be able to help figure out what happened in the last few years here in the South Bay or every where for that matter, respond with your true, honest thoughts and opinions........
..........I am sending a recent picture with this post to just show I am a real guy and this is a real post.....
......Looking forward to hearing from all, and hell it may be a fun and adventurous way to help each other out, figure out what has changed and why it is so hard to find awesome and fun people who are looking for the same things that we all are looking for!!...............Please put your favorite drink or food in the Title so I know you are someone real, for even though there are alot of fun, great people on Craigslist, there are those fakes and not so cool people who have nothing else better to do then try to mess your day up!!................
....................Hope you had a great Saturday and the rest of the weekend!! Thank you for reading my post..........

I am not what you're looking for; you never imagined my existence.
I seem normal-ish; know how to fit in, how to be invisible, how to turn on charm to hold court, how to wear the professional masque, how to have fun, how to disappear.

I have a sense of style.
I'm not always this cold.
It takes patience to get to know me. 
But I'm not ""high-maintenance""

I like smart... too smart... the kind that never meets its match
I like clean
I like sensitive
I like beautiful
I like sweetness
I like playful

I have a penchant for the exotic, for aquiline profiles, for jazz-punk, unexpected plot twists, for meticulously planned hours and, spontaneous long voyages.

I need honourable
I need honest
I need to be seen and heard
I need mutual respect

Some kind of activity makes for a good ice-breaker:
I like live music- for deep listening, or dancing, or both
I like the beauty of wilderness, which is never pristine even if it is virginal
I like the beauty and the curious in this synthesized world of culture and art as well; I can walk around all day looking at paintings as easily as looking at trees or slugs or rocks.
I'm particular about films, and theatre, and literature; love it or hate it, it makes for a discussion springboard.

I'm not much of a drinker
I don't get sports
I hate shopping

If this sounds like it's all about me, it's because I have no idea, to whom I am speaking.
I can't show what a good listener I can be, until you say something.

Hi,

If we could meet there that's no problem! ^^ I would like to dance battle with some of you, if you wanna take a chance to battle with me!! If you could dance battle with me, that's a PLUS!! ^^ lose buy me a drink, I lose I buy you a shot! deal?! xD

Me:
I'm asian, single (not looking), live in SF Bay Area, in my late 20's, I'm pretty much down to earth kind of girl, loves to clubs (we.. not often haha only sometime/that's only a night activities), drug/drama free. I'm always random so be aware of that.

If you're interested please shoot me some email and please describe yourself, age, ethnicity? What you like to do for fun and what you do for living?

You:
If you're cool, kind heart, open minded, loves to explore, down to earth, friendly, drug/drama free, GOOD PERSONALITY & also attractive. I don't mind hanging out with you, unless you're interesting. =]

Won't be responding if you send me an one liner.. I dislike one liners.. it's just so boring to me...

I'm here to make friends, not looking for any bf or hook ups, not in the mood for any.

PS: I don't like SPAMMERS, when e-mail put your ""favorite club"" in the subject, tell me why you like that club, that way I know you're real. ^^

Looking for someone cool to go out and have some drinks with sometime. I am looking for a road dog/friend to have good times with and I'm open to gay, bi, or straight friends.

I am looking for a lessor that would like to jump in and take me for a test drive.
I have a shinny and attractive exterior, and my interior is clean and beautiful too, with really soft seats (by soft I mean very comfortable).
My engine is strong, I handle like a dream, and when you get in for a drive, you better hold on!
Once you get behind my wheel, you will feel safe and secure. My passion and responsiveness to your every move is clearly felt around every corner.

When you are behind my wheel, you will never want to stop driving. Continuous joy rides will
be a necessity for our happiness. When we are together, you will forget about how we got to our destination and will only remember the wonderful time we had as we were on our way.

The woman who wants to take this drive with me should not be a smoker, drug user (my interior is sensitive to dependent drivers) you should also fit nicely in to my warm, form fitting bucket seats because they will hold onto you firmly through our long scenic drives. 
You should also consider me as your second vehicle and enjoy driving with me often.

If you want to take a spin with me, and not just a ride, but a memorable journey, the drivers side door is open for you:)
Jump in and lets see where it takes us!

I am a husband and father who enjoys receiving massage. I admire and value the sacred space created by practitioners, to heal the body and quiet the mind. Bodywork has proven integral to my well being, as both a pleasant and practical form of facilitated meditation.

But a massage isn't something I can afford to have often. So, instead of paying to feel this way, I'd rather massage others for free. Performing bodywork lets me repay the patience, generosity, and attention that I received on the table. Moreover, I gain a very different sense of myself, which is truly a gift all its own.

My offer is simple, straight forward, and easy to attain: have a body that you want massaged. We'll coordinate schedules, then meet once, or regularly. My intention is to heal, connect with, and relieve your physical body.

I am a professional Black male, in my late thirties, of average weight and height. My personality type (ENTP) emphasizes thinking over feeling, which explains this lengthy post and my pursuit of sensate connections. My wife understands me best of course, and is my rock in this endeavor. She recognizes my need to be used, tasked, and encouraged by women. Through this ad, she is allowing you to do just that.

I've offered my time and attention via Craigslist in the past, and may provide references - if not, testimonials. I'm available for 1 to 3 hour sessions, most evenings, weekends, and Fridays. You can visit my modest Berkeley studio, or I can travel to you, within 30 minutes of Lake Merritt. I own a portable table, use draping, and have been privileged to work with various body types, abilities and conditions.

Please note that I am merely a student of touch, with no formal training. If you have any relevant ailments or medically diagnosed concerns, you are strongly advised to inform me. I can research and prepare, but ultimately trust that you know your health best. Above all else, I encourage feedback, and will dutifully adjust my stroke for your comfort.

My style is an intuitive mix of Swedish, Esalen, Lomi Lomi, and Thai stretches. I'm also familiar with the sacrum, psoas, glutes, adductors, and some lymph systems. You're welcome to inquire about your preferred modality as well - learning them expands my capacity to serve. Whatever the request or preference, I aim to deliver what you need to relax.

I welcome all inquiries. The most common one asks why I do this for free. While there is no fee, your presence and attention are invaluable. Caring for others helps me focus, open up emotionally, and simply be grateful. Giving is a chance to be present, which allows me to see my own patterns and solve my own problems, more easily. Not only is money a hurdle to having these moments, it often diminishes their value.

I hope to have written enough that you might respond with the same confidence, good faith and gratitude that I've attempted to display. Should you reply, please include a reasonable introduction, and what you can about your unique massage goals, needs, and/or concerns. Simply include your photo if you would like mine, in kind. Otherwise, expect to voice verify or meet and greet before booking. Finally, title your response ""somatic healing"", so I might weed out spam.

Thank you for reading all of this through. Be well!

So honestly how is your marriage, ever think it is not what you thought it would be? I have been pondering that question a lot and, I just don't seem to understand things. I believe in communications and being honest, and truthful. Do you ever feel that you husband or partner is not really their for you and does not really understand you or is listening to you. I am not trying to bash anybody, but I do believe that marriage is an equally partnership, and we must always be open. I am just looking to talk to others that feel the someway. Looking to find friends and people that relate to what I am thinking. I am Asian male and actually we can talk about anything this was just a thought.

Hi there,

Seems like the good friends got married, have kids and are busy. Still in my life, but can't spend much time. I would love to meet someone out and about, but it does not work that way anymore. I have never tried online dating and not interested in doing so. 

A bit about me. I am a professional person. I am athletic, and enjoy doing outdoor activities. I have too many hobbies, and can't ever enjoy all of them at once. So I can honestly say I don't get bored easily. 

Family is very important to me. I am single with no children, but family lives far. That is the hard part. That is why I would love to have a sincere, best friend. I am not looking for sex, or a place to live, but companionship.

I love animals and my faith is very important to me.

I read some of these CL posts where people list so many specifics and a resume shouting out how many great characteristics they have and why they should be hired. That is not my style.

So if anything I said sounds of interest to you, send me an email.



Cheers

So.. Here's the situation: I'm a dude lookin for some new friends. Thing is, I've never had a problem makin friends with other guys. Girls though, that's a different story. It may be possible that I've just been introduced to the wrong ones. THOSE ""friends"" normally just wanted to hang out during parties, drink all my liquor and then they'd disappear till the next party. And they'd normally want a free ride to and from the party. Not down for that. I mean, don't get me wrong, I definitely wouldn't mind having a friend that I can drink with, in fact, I enjoy drinkin with my friends, but I'm looking for friends I can also kick it with when we're NOT drinkin.

About me: Half Hispanic, half Filipino, I like movies, tv, music, art, video games, beer, hanging out, drivin, among other things.

You: Be awesome, like similar things, be around my age like somewhere around 20-30, live near my area.

Fun Fact: If you're a Legend of Zelda fan, we might be besties. If you dislike Legend of Zelda, we might be mortal enemies.

Anywayz, if you're lookin for a new friend, I'm here. Send me an email if you're interested. If you wanna just text first that's cool with me, but I would like to kick it eventually. I'd write more about myself, but I feel that's something that we could talk about when we kick it. Also, I didn't post a pic cause this is Craigslist and I think it's weird, but I'll send one if you want, and I'd want one in return. I mean, I would like to place a face to the person I'm talkin to.

Or Kik me: S_Flame

Hope to hear from you soon!

I am not a CMT, but I have many years of training and experience in several modalities 
including Swedish, deep tissue, sports massage, and Esalen.
I am offering a 60 mins free massage in SF.

You can come to my studio or I can travel to you. (Only inside SF) 

This is a strictly platonic massage, so please no weird requests.

Hi! :)

I'm a self employed fashion designer running a business from home and finding that I'm just not making enough time to get out of the house and be social. I have a great live-in boyfriend of four years, an adorable little dog, and an overall very stable and happy, drama-free life. I'm not into binge-drinking or trying to attract men, etc. I just would like a girl friend to go get a coffee and see a movie with. Maybe take a hike in the hills, check out a new cafe, go to a concert or open mic, take an art or crafting class, go dancing. Extra points if you are a Bernie supporter, a feminist, a traveller, a vegetarian, a dog lover, a political activist, a poet, an artist, or a business owner.

I'd love to get a coffee and see Whiskey Tango Foxtrot this Saturday anytime. Get in touch if that sounds fun to you. 

Thanks!

Hi there! 
I am an attractive male looking for female dance partners. I love to dance which seems to be a bit out of the norm for a guy to be the one needing it. I truly love to feel the music flow throuh my body and express it the best way I know how....... and I don't mean straight up aggressive bump and grind pelvic thrusts although there is a time and a place for that. Lol. 

I am a soulful, classy, fun, sexy, energetic, smoooooooooth, and controlled dancer. By all means I am not a professional dancer... but professional dancers are whom I'd likely vibe with the best. Hopefully that doesn't scare too many off... I just have good rhythm and soul and want to share it with someone who gets it too.

If interested in a super fun night out on the town full of no pressure, no expectation dancing... again all about the dancing.... lets connect! 

Im 32, Caucasian, attractive, fit/ toned, tattoos, respectful of boundaries, respectful of space, can take a hint, can make us both feel sexy out there... 

Will love to dance to anything and everything but likes reggae, soul, funk, blues, rnb, hip hop, top 40, electronic..... anything soulful. :)

Please tell me a bit about yourself, when you want to get out, and maybe a photo? I'll return the favor. :)

LOOKING FOR NEW FRIENDS in the Northbay. I just moved to Santa Rosa from the Eastbay-- If this all resonates with you, please write me. Blessings to all to find the friends that are best for you.

I'd love to meet people that deeply mirror enough of my path and stages of growth so we can easily understand each other, feel compassion and provide support for each other. I'm new to the SF Northbay, I have a couple friends in the Eastbay but would like friends here to share my life stories and growth and listen to your life stories and growth. I'm looking for someone similar to me---already on a spiritual heart path. I'm a regular type person yet born heart-evolved, young at heart, a Lightworker, age 60, attractive, about to begin another part of my journey, the main portion of my Divine Life Purpose work. Desire someone to share life experiences, ups and downs, on our ongoing growth paths, with compassionate healing focuses on all levels-- mental emotional physical spiritual financial but mostly like to keep things simple, and focused on the heart, with deep self compassion and compassion for others. 

I am currently preparing to do a variety of work to create a financial foundation, dogwalking, groceryshopping, while I prepare to become an Angel Therapist (helping others connect to their Angels for healing all parts of their life). I do embrace basic spiritual laws like Ask & you will receive, and pay attention to your own beliefs to find blockages to receiving,etc but I mostly keep a grounded and honest focus, although I am basically an optimist with faith I also have a simple discerning tool that regularly sees red flags in myself and life so I can help heal or release things. Also I use basic humanistic psychology to see relationship dynamics needing to be healed in the world, with others and within oneself, often originating from one's childhood family issues, etc. My view of the world is that we are all blessed by the Divine and all have access to the Divine, and we all are receiving Divine assistance to bring thru healing for humanity and the earth, one person at a time, based on freewill choices. 

I'm also aware of the Sonoma State University archives of Project Censored, and the corporate greed going on. But mostly I just like to focus on creating a simple, grounded, compassionate life for myself and close friends. And would love to have someone to go with to the park and the river, and maybe some other event we could enjoy together. I'm becoming a vegetarian soon, and I'm trying to get in shape by simple stretching, but don't do any intense strenuous activity, although I used to dance and will be doing so again. 

I am a basically compassionate person and don't harm others, and need a friend who is similar, I am not judgemental but I am getting very clear about what type of support is nourishing for me. I need a little head but a lot of heart too. I'm not very emotional exactly, but I can be passionate about social justice issues, and when my heart is open I can cry in empathy with tears. Looking for a friend in the same ballpark, so we can support each other, but also have access to our own intuitive guidance and listen to our own inner wisdom and bodywisdom. So we don't need to do much of anything but be compassionate witnesses for each other, and just both of us share and both of us listen. I'm planning on following Christiane Northrup book, Goddesses Never Age. 

Although I've been on a spiritual path, my childhood background has been to come from a more traditional background, so I had to work hard to release beliefs that interfered with my desired process, so in that way my orientation still reflects a much more grounded approach to all my work, simple, kind, loving, open, transparent, is how I approach the work and myself, so I still sometimes struggle as I'm creating a solid and fully self-loving perspective that will be perfect for me, healthy and grounded. I believe that many teachers don't realize how much they use anti-human language that disconnects them from their own feelings, authentic process, and natural comfort zone and body wisdom. I like to keep my path, my work, and my perspectives very simple and very grounded and very human oriented. If this all resonates with you simply and deeply, please write me. Looking forward to meeting you.

Hello new friends,
We are a band of friends looking to expand our social circle. We are one female and two guys (one male is married to the female). Sometimes the circle gets bigger depending on the events but that is the main core of it. We are in our 30's, drama free, no kids, active and fit, funny, and very social. We are out of Oakland, will go anywhere in the bay area that offers fun activities, good entertainment, food, or drinks or all of the above. We are down to try new things and love to travel. This has nothing to do with sex so don't even ask! This is about being strictly friends and having a fun time.
Please tell us more about you. Looking forward to getting to know you.
Sincerely,
CR, DH, SRH

Any professional dancer out there that don't mind a beginner dancing partner?

As you know, dancing makes you smarter, that's what I was led by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. Dancing reduces stress and depression, increases energy & serotonin, improves flexibility, strength, balance, endurance, strengthens bones, boosts cardiovascular health, and increases mental health.

I am interested in learning all kind of dances, Bachata, Cha Cha, Foxtrot, Merengue, Salsa, Swing, Tango. I am currently taking private lessons at Arthur Murray. 

I'm well established, I have flexible hours, athletic body type, down to earth, peaceful, and a no drama type of girl that you like to dance with. 

As for you, must be well established, excellent oral hygiene, have flexible hours, no drama, sincere and like to go club for social dances.

I am not looking for a boyfriend or a relationship, straightly a professional dancing partner.

Hope to hear from you soon!!!

So I will start off by asking please do not flag, this is not a sexual thing and I figured this is the best place to post this.

I'm seeking a certain type of cuddle buddy. I'm looking for someone who is interested in an ANR type relationship. If you don't know what that means it stands for adult nursing relationship. Its a friendship or relationship based on the intimacy and bonding of cuddling and nursing on a woman's breasts. It is not based around sexual activity. It can be the most relaxing, natural feeling cuddle session you have ever had. If done correctly and often enough you can even begin to lactate but that can be talked about further and doesn't have to be the goal of this. Please message me for further details and to get to know each other.

If it matters I'm a fit, young, attractive and clean white male.

Thanks again for understanding and not flagging

I'm a gay guy looking to get over some long-standing hangups I have about straight men and emotional intimacy between men.

I'm 32. I grew up in the midwest. I think I'm generally pretty well-adjusted. I've been with my boyfriend for 7 years and we've got a healthy, honest, and communicative relationship. Despite being comfortable with myself and who I am, I have difficulty forming close friendships with straight men. I tend to avoid being too nice or getting too close out of fear that I'll cross some boundary, make them uncomfortable, or generally that it'd be inappropriate in some way.

I want to be more comfortable being myself around straight men, expressing affection, etc. I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for, but some options:

- Someone to chat with about this stuff. Email, chat, phone or whatever.
- A guy I could talk frankly about sex with (straight sex and gay sex)
- A guy I could be casually physically affectionate with the way I am with women and other gay men.
​- A friend to hang out with, play video games, hike/backpack, watch movies with.

Hopefully this would be helpful for both of us. I'm sure there are lots of guys primarily interested in sex with women who still have hangups about male intimacy and caring, or bi-curious guys who'd like to talk things out.

Not to be too negative, but I'm NOT looking for gay guys who are closeted, guys who fetishize straightness, or guys who are only looking for sex. No offense, just not what I'm looking for.

To wrap up, this is pretty personal stuff for me. I'm kind of nervous about putting this out there, and I'm not sure if I even want to follow through. I'd probably want to email a bit before meeting up, if I even felt comfortable meeting at all. Thanks for understanding.

If you're a married man (or once were) or if you're in a long-term relationship with a woman and you'd like a discreet place to discuss your sexuality and form genuine friendships with similar men, please check out the ""Married/Once Married Men's Group"" that meets weekly at the Pacific Center in Berkeley. It's the only group of its type that meets in the Bay Area.

Although the group is primarily platonic, there have been times in the past when a long-term romance has developed between two members.

One thing the group is NOT is a place to find hook-up partners.

The group is anonymous and the confidentiality of all participants is protected. Current ""regulars"" range in age from 28 - 68 and the average number of attendees each week is nine. Meetings are every Wednesday night, from 8pm - 9:50pm. The Pacific Center is located at 2712 Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley.

I started attending more than three years ago when I was looking for feedback on coming out to my teenage kids. I didn't expect to attend more than once, but because the guys' feedback was so helpful, I returned to tell them how it went. I've been hooked ever since. I've found my tribe - there's no other social group like it. The dynamic is neither straight nor gay, it's somewhere in between.

I'm posting this information, not because the group needs more participants, but because it's a unique resource that hundreds of men have found invaluable throughout the group's 30+ year history.

I'm 41 m, originally from the east coast, moved out here a few years back. Work in sales for a large tech co. Pretty normal and easy going i enjoy working out, movies, music, sports, drives, drinks, and good conversation always goes a long way. 

Anyhow, if you are interested in talking more would love to hear back from you. Open to email/Yahoo, or even texting if we hit it off...

Hi Artistic Women of the Bay Area: 

OK, this is going to be an odd one!! Anyway, the truth is that I have always thought about posing nude for a woman artist, painter, photographer, etc. Although I've wanted to try it, I was too chicken to pull the trigger and act out on the idea. But I'm over that -- I'm ready to give it a try! 

So, if you are a female artist (professional or amateur) or art student, and if you want someone to practice with, please do let me know. I will help you out in any way I can. I'm also willing to pay you for the experience. (Is $100 fair?) 

To the extent it matters, I'm a white male who is in good shape, handsome, and fit. I'm also a very nice and friendly person, who is a business professional in his ""real life."" 

I'd take my job seriously, and do my best to be a good model for you. I mean it.

Hi there --
I'm free this afternoon and thought it would be sort of an adventure to soak in a hot tub with someone interesting from CL -- feel the same way?
This is platonic only!
I keep in shape, but I'll keep my swim trunks on!
My ideal hot-tubbing partner would be someone who loves cats, the outdoors and fresh air.
It's sucky weather out there today and I'll be available this afternoon. I'm 420 friendly and friendly in general! I'm a 'professional' who is off for the next week.

I'm going either way. I don't mind going solo, but it would be more fun to go with someone and maybe become friends(!)
sound like a plan?

I've recently had the inclination to make a new friend. A homegirl, a super rad lady friend, a straight up doll. Someone new and interesting who is capable of knocking my socks off with their awesomeness. I'm in a relationship and my ideal friend would be too.
Some affectionate ball busting and joke cracking would be our primary deal... with maybe a little flirting if the chemistry is right.

I'm extremely picky. I value individually, creativity, hard work and a stellar comedic witt. A huge plus if you walk the line between creative bohemian and jock. Any age from 20 to 30 works for me. Well that's it for now I suppose. Hope to hear from you soon, pretty lady.

I bet we both are....

And yes, we are and should both married or attached...but in need and search of more since we cant really change our current situations.... I guess we have already this in common if you are still reading this ad.

I'm not alone I bet... Life is way too short to keep losing time as we are getting older everyday...

I am hoping to find a nice and sincere woman... a wise woman...attractive too...I'm mostly attracted to light complexure women....

I workout regularly and take care of myself... So I'm hoping to find a gal that likes similar things that is in good shape and takes care of herself!

We can find ourselves in situations that seemingly have no end. My wife has become more of a roommate than anything else. Circumstances that I will not go into here prevent me from leaving. Been together for a long time and now we just pass each other in the night. There are stupid arguments, stupid fights, no ugly but dormant. It's impossible to talk. Who would understand? Who would even believe? After all, we're are perceived as always been happy....We are what everyone envision as the 'perfect' marriage.

I am looking for a confident,friends with benefits, or anything with passion. I want companionship, friendship, communication, mutual respect, trust and caring. I'm looking for someone, preferably married, who may be in a similar situation and looking for a little something more in their life. Let's be each others friend, companion, confidant and possibly lovers if it goes that far. Communication is key with me. I like to exchange cute emails and chats during the day. It's simply a lot of fun because I'm a also romantic at heart.

I'm not looking to be your new husband nor am I looking for you to be my new wife. When we can, we'll steal moments away with each other.

I'm an educated hard working professional, funny, discreet, humorous, caring, polite, respectful, laid back person that knows how to treat a lady as a lady. I'm a romantic and caring person. I like to engage in funny give and take conversations with a bit of humorous bantering. I'm a passionate person who is missing much of that now in my life. I would like to meet and be with a special friend on many levels; intellectually, compassionately, as good friends that share and confide in each other and also passionately. I'm a good listener and very sensitive to the moods and needs of those close to me. Affectionate and caring. I keep my self in decent shape. If everything works out fine it will blossom into a nice romance.

Please put the "" city that you live in"" in subject replies so I know you have read me...

I hope it's not too odd of a request but I really enjoy cuddling and being single/in an on off relationship has definitely prevented that from happening as much as I would of liked. I'm seeking more of a connection internally. To put it simply I want to lay next to you and hold you in my arms while we watch Netflix and sincerely enjoy each others company until you fall asleep in my arms. I am definitely not seeking bout sexual encounters but however if there are sparks when we touch I am open to making out,possibly more;). If your interested please understand the need for discretion is a must for me I cannot have face pics floating around but I am open to other forms of sending pics like Snapchat or Skype video chat. I'm 23, pretty attractive, hazel eyes,420 friendly,maybe we can burn before we cuddle if your into 420 as well?

Hello,

I'm bookish, a reader and thinker. I write stuff but not in an ego-driven, look-at-me way. I typically come across as quiet. I'm more frequently a pedestrian than a driver, go to libraries more often than bookstores. But I'm not seeking someone identical to myself.

""Ditch vision"" is apparently a term coined by an obscure poet (Jeremy Hooker) to refer to the predisposition to seek the miraculous and wondrous in small, mundane things. I identify with that. I guess I'm a practitioner of what you might call ""the new parochialism,"" seeking transcendence (to be transported) here at home, by what's local and specific -- within arm's reach or walking distance.

Anyway, I enjoy walking (wandering on foot), poetic reverie, philosophizing, reading out loud, and so forth. I also enjoy throwing a frisbee in a peaceful way; tennis too, possibly, though honestly it's been a while. And I run (jog) to keep fit.

If you enjoy any of the above, feel free to send me a message. Thanks.

I am at a bar drinking by myself thinking that I could go up and talk to people, but they just become the 1 night friend you know? After that you never hear from them. Sure you can meet people who stick with you, but I have yet to see that. Anyways, I'm simply looking for a kind of woman who loves to go out, who would love to go out the pier, the beach, downtown, a bar, or wherever we go and simply have a good time and chat about what revolves around our life and everything else. Just because I'm a guy doesn't always have to mean that I'm just looking to hook up. I'm simply looking for a woman to call my friend right now, and to ask her out for a fun night, that's it. I like to text, but really I'm all about meeting up for a coffee and talk in person, like it should be anyways. A little about me would be that my name is Alexander, I'm 21, I have a job as a lyft driver, I'm single, I'm Hispanic, and the rest we could talk about it in person haha. The only thing I ask from you is that you're at least above drinking age and single, I'm really not up for drama. Hope to hear from you!

Don't know why I'm posting as I know I won't get a response but here's to trying.

So I don't have much friends, not really anyone close to talk to. Although I'm in a committed relationship, I feel an empty void which ceases any motivation to do anything new. Am I just settling? 

I wish I can find a nice pen pal or even good female friend. A best friend. A gym partner to motivate health, A geeky girl for gaming entertainment, a realist to converse with. Share stories, share opinions, and most of all a guide to life. 

I don't know what I'm doing but I'm letting life respond...

I've tried other places, and dating websites to find new friends. But things never work out as they are either interested in dating, or don't believe when I say I'm looking for a friend.

Also if you're interested in chatting or miss the old instant messaging days. Message me on kik oxy1984.

FIRST TIME USER of the internet dating scene...
I do not know what to expect but here it goes!

I, myself do not have a problem meeting woman; HOWEVER, finding the right one is a different story...

I am hoping to cross paths with that special someone: capable of having an intellectual yet stimulating conversation. A fun, loving, good spirited person. A down-to-earth chick willing to explore the meaning of life and what it has to offer. A REAL LADY beautiful ""internally"" as well as ""externally."" That certain one, that I know is right_because of how it feels from the pit of my stomach.

Me: I am a hard working, success driven single dad. I do not need nor do I want from the next man. 
I believe in Old School values, whereas a lady should be treated as such. However, please come correct and thus I will do the same.

I am hoping to entertain the idea of possibly dinner, a cup of coffee/tea or perhaps a walk on the beach. I am a simple man_ that has no expectations other than to have a good time with lots of accompanied laughter.

What do you say??

Reply with today's date in the memo area. A picture would be greatly appreciated. 
Leaving a contact/phone number would probably serve us best. I prefer talking over the monotonous back and forth text and/or emails (it is more personable and less confusing).

Looking forward to talking to you soon;)

I just finished a Software Quality Assurance program and now seeking employment but after numerous phone interviews and emails, I've been told that many prefer those who have knowledge of scripting languages for automation. 

So here I am, I am seeking a friend(s), who have some free time and would like to teach me scripting languages. 

I'd love to learn any of these:
- Java
- JavaScript
- Perl
- PHP
- Python (my number one choice) 
- Ruby
- C++
- C#
- groovy 

While in school, we were introduced to Selenium IDE, Web-driver and Grid. 

You can be male or female, it does not matter. BUT please realized that this is purely platonic. I would love it if we became friends in this process. I am reaching out, and this is also my way of being social (im more of an introvert).

I've been in CA for 2.5 years and still don't know that many people. I was talking to some friends recently and they found themselves in the same boat. Well, I'm going to the St Pats parade on March 12th with a buddy of mine. If you wanna go but have no one to go with, come join us. Hell if you're a couple or know others looking to get to know new people, bring them. Gay, straight, male, female... Who cares. I just think it would be fun to have an eclectic group of friends. Come alone or drag a few with you. Never know who you'll meet. 

Me, I'm a tall, white gay man who's 35. Live in Marin. Good job. Like to 420. Single and not looking for love at the moment. But am looking to meet new people. Love hiking up steep hills on the weekend, gasping for breath the whole way. Bonfires on the beach with some beers, old classic movies played at the opera or an old theater, museums and painting, be f'ing lazy, laying in the sun at Dolores park, touring missions, walking tours. 

My buddy is straight FYI.

Hey! Looking for friends that I can share and experience great, adventurous moments with!

I love hiking, camping (only been camping where I've slept in a cabin, but would love to explore the full outdoor experience), traveling, museums, checking out and exploring nearby places and towns, going on random adventures, all and all spontaneous fun basically!

I am 25 years old, and still have a lot to explore (worldly), and it would be really nice to meet people with the same sense of adventure and zest for life as I have.
Energetic, down to earth, free, and full of life! Definitely young at heart for sure!

I love going out, however I am not that into the whole alcohol/drug scene. Don't mind if you are. This doesn't mean that I am necessarily a ""goody goody."" It just means that I'm already crazy enough on my own that I don't need any extra stimulants to keep me going and give me the sensation of having a good time lol. I need a fearless girl to my friend. Someone who is too good for bad, but too bad for good....

And for the Love of God, please be from or very close to the Santa Rosa area.
I want to meet real people.

Hey there! I'm a 26 yr old gay male living in Daly City right now. I work in tech in San Francisco. My lease ends in September and I would like to move someplace closer to / in the city, then. Posting this now since its so difficult to find a good place with nice roommates in the city.

A little bit about myself - I'm an amateur nudist, however, I'm not always naked at home. I like to be naked in my room. I'm looking for a place with like minded people so that if I want to grab something from the kitchen and get back to my room, I don't have to wear clothes for like 10 secs and then take them off. I'm okay with others being naked at home all the time. 

Besides that, I like to hike, bike, explore places, restaurants, read fiction, spend time in coffee shops. I'm very clean when it comes to cleaning up after myself and keeping the common area clean but not OCD clean. I can be as social as my roommates would like. It would be awesome to find a couple of nudists to live with. I'm looking for 1-3 roommates and hopefully not more than 2 people would share a bathroom so that we can all get to work on time. I don't have pets but I do love cats and dogs so if you have either of them or both, it won't be a problem for me.

My budget is max $1500, lesser the better! If you think we could be roommates, reply with ""Roommate in September"" in the header so that I can filter out spam.

I have to state this but I am not looking for sex, repeat I am not looking for sex so that means no fwb situation involving sex but I am however looking for a woman friend I can flirt with. Also it is a shame that I have to state this too but I am only looking for women who were born women and women who are single and not married or in a relationship. I the type of guy who will give you attention like text you out of nowhere or have fun and funny conversations and trust me if I was in your life you would be laughing whenever you talked to me or laughing about what I said the last time you talked to me.

Hello! I'm a professional photographer of over ten years, shooting mostly abandoned locations such as hospitals, jails, military facilities, railways, desert landscapes, country ranches, and historic buildings throughout California. I've also been working with models (pro and amateur) for portraits, film set previews, and storyboard projects for several years now as well.

I'm looking for a female model who can pose nude or semi-nude for my current photography project titled ""Urban Decay: Hidden Beauty Within"".

**Please Note: This is NOT an erotic project. Any/all offers will be reported and deleted immediately.**

Processed originals will be available to you at no cost (free) in exchange for your time and use. -- Great for amateurs or new models who want to build their portfolios!!

The locations I will be shooting the project in are:
- San Jose
- Morgan Hill
- Gilroy
- Saratoga
- Santa Cruz Mountains
- Seaside
- Monterey
- Treasure Island
- SF Presidio
- Marin Headlands

The majority of the shots will be in daylight, but if agreed upon, may include some nighttime moonlit exposure shoots as well (weather-dependant). -- **If you are interested and able to travel outside the bay area, I also shoot on filmset locations throughout the Mojave Preserve several times a year.

All areas where we shoot are always safe and secure, and none are within the public eye to maintain respect and privacy. You (the model) are welcome to bring a friend to the photoshoot as long as the friend does not interfere with the model or disrupt the photographer during the photoshoot.

I'm specifically looking for models with the following traits:
- Age: 18-45
- Build: skinny, thin, average
- Cup Size: A-C
- Skin Tone: light, pale, white
- Tattoos: None, some okay
- Piercings: None, some, alot, more
- Body Mods: None

We will meet for a basic interview and discussion of the project first before visiting the locations for the photo shoot. Your own transportation is required unless prior arrangements are made.

All potential models will need to sign a Model Release Form before starting work. This form is basically a written agreement stating that I have permission to photograph you and to use your image in my photography works.

Any questions or discuss the project, please ask! Please also send one head shot and one full-body shot for consideration (no erotic or porn photos please).

Hope to hear from you soon! -- Have a great day!

I travel around the peninsula often. Love San Mateo too, so it's cool if you want to hang around there.

I'm not new to the area, nor am I lacking friends. I happen to have a work schedule that allows a lot of free time on the weekdays and it's hard to find company when everyone else is working.

My interests: racket sports (tennis, badminton, ping pong), weekend cycling (not competitive), electronics, experiencing other cultures, food, beer, movies, smart people!

To be completely honest, I just want to see what it's like to meet someone online. Never done this, and I figured I should try it.

If you have some time on the weekdays (or even weekends), I'd be happy to meet over coffee (I honestly prefer beer!). Or if you just want to walk around and chat, that's cool too. I have a dog that we could walk with.

I'm an avid nudist, enjoy the outdoors, love travelling, photography, and being with like-minded people.

I have a trans-male friend that I met a few months ago and loves the nudist/naturist lifestyle. I'm looking for more trans people (male and female) to enjoy the nudist/naturist life with in a close-knit group setting. This is an excellent way to become comfortable in your own skin, and be around others who have nothing but love and respect for you and enjoy who you are, not what you have.

For me, it's being free in nature, surrounding myself with the fresh air, and taking in all that nature has to offer. It can also be a spiritual-healing moment for many who are searching for something more.

Common activities include:
- home gatherings (movies, games, food)
- outdoor activities (nature walks, nudist beaches, camping, hiking, etc)
- urban exploring (google if you do not know what this is)
- clothing-optional hot springs (tecopa, saline valley, death valley)

Please include a photo of yourself in your kitchen when you respond (weeds out spambots and pervs who can't read). I'll gladly respond in kind if true, or delete if no photo. I also request that we meet in person before joining our small group as this is a trusted circle and we only let in those who truly seek the nudist lifestyle (vs those who are in it for sex). This helps calm any jitters and allows us to be ourselves without proving anything.

Hope to hear from you soon. Cheers! :-)

You are open-minded, intelligent, active, humorous and honest.
You know how to laugh at yourself and are naturally playful.
You welcome the depth of a philosophical discussion while also embracing silly banter.
Your mind works quickly, and you are sure of who you are and what you want.

To me, your race, age, or physicality is not important. Your self-confidence is.

I am fit because I thrive on being active. I'd like to find someone who enjoys hiking or road cycling, because eventually we might want to do things together. I find that women bring a unique perspective, and I appreciate that.
I am a married dad who, like so many others, is looking for a female friend with whom I can engage in a transaction that ignites me.

Let's start the conversation in email, and if we connect, continue by meeting. If we decide eventually to meet regularly, your ability to host will be important.

I hope you are enjoying your evening. I am in search of some fellow 420 friendly people. I always enjoy meeting new people, making new friends an' exchanging stories, a new hiking/ outdoorsy/ smoking buddy(420) would be great. 

While I am not apposed to finding someone to date, that's not really my goal in life right now. I would like to expand my social circle and enjoy some good conversations with some fun and exciting people. If you are amenable, let's get a drink or a smoke (I have a great patio garden for smoking) and see what mischief life has in-store. 

Anyways, A lil a bout me:
I live in North San Jose, I am an avid gardener, I throughly enjoy getting others into gardening as well or just helping them get the hang of it, I enjoy anything in nature, hiking, biking, drives up north to the deep woods or any excuse to do a road trip, Work in the tech industry, and I throughly enjoy random adventures/acts of kindness. Oh, and I cannot take a good picture to save my life, sorry just lame like that I guess. ;)

Good evening CL ladies, 

I hope you are enjoying a pleasant day. I am in search of some new smoking buddies. I am 420/215 friendly with my Rx. Looking for some more like minded people whom enjoy smoking and good conversations. I am NOT looking for a hook up, FWB, or anything like that, strictly platonic just lie the category. I live in the Downtown San Jose area, it would be nice if you are close but cool either way. I have my own place so we can hang out there or go for a hike/drive or whatever. 

A lil about me, mid 30's, Caucasian, high tech job, I enjoy a good conversation and can hold my own on most topics, fairly well read on a variety of topics, and love to learn more. I love animals but have none. Anything to do with nature and the outdoors, hiking, long road trips to the forests up north, is in my wheelhouse. I think I am pretty funny and I throughly enjoy cracking jokes, most of my friends would agree that I am pretty funny, you'll just have to wait and see. 

You may have noticed that I didn't include a physical discription, because it really doesn't matter seeing as I don't want a date/girlfriend/or any other romantic entanglement, simply a good hearted person whom also likes to burn and relax. 

Ok, well I hope that I sparked some interest (pun intended). Drop me a note, let's see what mischief we can get ourselves into. Nonetheless, I hope you have a fun and exciting day.

Having spent a while looking for a girlfriend now... what I've learned is that it's useless to try. Not giving up on love, just the search for it. So if you were born a female, between 26ish-32ish, are not obese, are not high and enjoy doing things, going places and eating... you're perfect! What are you perfect for? That part can be hashed out over time through conversation. And yes... I'm here for a reason... I'm not asking for nor expecting nor tangentially hoping for anything beyond friendship.

For a while, I've been developing a series cannabis infused oils as external ointments, (but they are quite edible), to be used as lip-balms and or skin ointments. All of these ointments have a very mild sedative effect, but there's no way that they could considered euphoric. But recently I've developed something a lot more potent. From several reports that I've received so far it seems to supercharge the libido and kick the horny factor into overdrive.

Now I need more women to use their vaginas to advance the frontiers of hedonistic research All that you would have to do at first is try massaging a teaspoon of the salve inside your vagina and around your clitoris, (I'm assuming you'd try some under your tongue first so as to assure yourself of it's safety and well as effectiveness) and then wait about 15 minutes. Then play with yourself and/or your partner. We'll adjust the formula using the results of your test. There will be absolutely no pressure on you to have me as your sex partner. I doubt you'd find me an adequate partner anyway. I'm 63 years old, partially disabled and have a big-time heart condition. Not only am I, almost by definition a lousy fuck, but fucking would probably kill me.

You must a valid ID proving that you're 18+ years of age and have a valid medical marijuana card in order for me to give you 1/2 oz.(2~4 doses), of this lubricant. Other than that it's a free trip.... Just tell me what you think about it.

I'm trying to get a date on the internet! Yay. Unfortunately I have a rare condition that I think the doctors called something like ""Having No Friends in Real Life"" Syndrome. Fortunately, I thought of a good way to trick potential dates into believing that I have friends: get my picture taken with a random stranger.

You: a man in possession of a digital camera (or decent cameraphone) and semi-proficiency in its operation. Must be willing to pose with me in a few ""candid"" photographs, perhaps staged to appear like I have even more than one friend.

Upon receipt of these photographs I am prepared to buy you one beer at a nearby establishment of your choosing. Perhaps we will even become actual friends!

I'm really chill with everyone I just like to cuddle and chill but I have no one to do that with. The only problem is I can't host. So if you could host that will be perfect but if you can't either it's fine we could go somewhere like drive ins or just chill anywhere I don't mind haha. I will love if your btw the ages 28-35.

Hello everyone,

Not sure from where to begin. I am an middle eastern woman who was brought up in a conservative but educated family. Moved to US with 2 kids, when I was in my twenties and I always had dreams and aspirations to have a good career, dress young, look beautiful and hep and have a loving partner. But because of kids and finances I had to take a back seat in the family. 

Now I am in my mid thirties, settled, and my kids are in teens.
In real life, I am mature enough to hang out with woman of my age, on other hand I have to hang out with more mature woman close to fifties to have play dates for my kids. These woman dress old and talk old. So I feel, I am nowhere.

On other hand, my hubby is conservative man who does not know how to love, respect or treat a mother of her own kids, so our communication is limited to kids or house chores. I have lost interest in him.

When ever I tried to reach other men, they are interested in sex only.
Sex, I can always get from my hubby. 
Really, I have started hating most men and they lack empathy and just want there way out of you. 

Not sure what to do? how to track my life? Advise?

Mature, attractive, well-dressed professional gentleman with a bit of a makeup fetish seeks very attractive, fashion-forward woman who would enjoy being treated to a new lipstick or two in exchange for letting me tag along and enjoy the process of selection...

I know this is a bit of an unusual fetish but its fairly harmless and some women have even found me a rather enjoyable shopping partner with a good eye for color and shading...

I'm tall and boyish... professional and elegant in appearance... I know this isn't everyone's' cup of tea, but I have found a few women who understand and even enjoy indulging this fairly harmless fetish... interested women should respond with a picture...

First, let's agree to dispense with any pretense that you and I are seeking something purely platonic. The Strictly Platonic category is nothing more than a psychological neutral zone where we can each find a modicum of comfort in using Craigslist as a cyber-conduit. Besides, this particular category provides plausible deniability when romantic gestures are rebuked for whatever reason. We each know that platonic relationships between men and women are reserved for in-laws, colleagues at the office, and parents of your child's playmates, which in themselves have the ability to become entangled. Let's simply be honest with our purpose for using CL's Platonic section and we can move forward in liberating transparency. 

Craigslist offers a brilliant opportunity to embellish all that I have to offer a woman. It's the perfect platform to exaggerate everything that is me and no one will know the depths of fiction I descend into for the sake of anonymous replies. If one takes a moment to consider how easy it is to conjure up an idealized portrait of oneself, it's as wonderfully beautiful as it is alarming. With that in mind, I beg your indulgence as I describe more about me and offer you confessions of a Craigslist man.

I suppose it's only natural to initially get the physical description out front. Sure, I could attach a photo to this ad but that would be at clear odds with my actual physical characteristics. Stating that I'm 6'01"" and 178 lb. may cause considerable confusion and consternation when we meet at the prearranged time at Starbucks for our meet-and-greet. Of course, by the time we introduce one another, I suspect that I will have enchanted you with my charm, wit, and head-spinning knowledge of the socio-economic conditions within the Czech Republic that you will be blind to my 5'03"" and 327 lb. frame. I fully anticipate, after the initial shock wears off, that you will agree that I carry my weight exceptionally well. After the first few minutes, I confidently submit that you will not even notice which limb I have missing, my eyepatch will become less conspicuous, and my needed oxygen tube and accompanying tank will disappear as you listen with rapt attention as I drone on and on about my life. We will undoubtedly become lost in stories about myself as we sip our caramel macchiatos and pick at that wonderful Starbucks iced lemon pound cake that I insisted you purchase for us to share.

And yes, my conversation skills are limited to only things about me. Contrary to my correspondence that seemingly had me interested in you as a person, which eventually led to the Starbucks rendezvous, I will sit and self-obsessively regale you with story after story about my life, politics, failed past relationships, disagreeable personalities at work, interests, and experiences. After all, if I were to ask you anything about yourself so that I may know you better, it would unnecessarily take time away from my soliloquy concerning all things about me. As a Craigslist man, I find myself endlessly fascinating and only wish to share everything about me - however greatly exaggerated those details will be -at the expense of knowing anything about you. It's not as though my self-indulgence is a crutch used to mask my fragile ego and personality pathologies, so please forgo the temptation to employ any dime-store psychology. 

Casting a wide net is extremely important when looking for responses to a Craigslist ad. Appealing to the more shallow and superficial of women who will read this is part of my task. First, I cut and paste a photo of a car that I disingenuously claim is mine. My experience has proven that German manufactured automobiles tend to be the most well received. Thanks to Photoshop, I send off a picture of me standing next to ""my"" 2014 7-Series BMW. Again, the purpose for the deception is to acquire the proper interest needed to secure the first date at Starbucks. By the time the macchiatos are sipped to the bottom of our venti cups, there will be no chance that you will refuse to push my rusted 1973 Datsun so to help engage the starter as I drive off with white smoke belching from the broken exhaust pipe. 

Understandably, the condition and location of my residence is always of interest. Once again, I enlist the tool for easy deception - Photoshop. The picture of me standing proudly in my billiard room works perfectly. After all, if I'm well-to-do enough to have a billiard room, the reader's imagination will be swirling with calculations of the square footage that surrounds me. (I used to send out a photo of me enjoying a cocktail and lounging next to ""my"" Neptune pool, but even I found that to be a bit too pretentious) Oh, in case you are wondering, I do have a pool table and it is in a room, well, the basement. The clutter surrounding the table makes for a difficult game of 8-ball, however, once one becomes adept at avoiding side shots made difficult by the intrusion of boxes filled with 1970's porn magazines, it is manageable. The wicked stench emanating from the three unattended cat boxes is something you will adjust to eventually. (I haven't had a cat in over six years)

Inconveniently, my marital status seems to always be of interest to women who reply to my Craigslist ads. As a Craigslist man, I've learned that it's best to claim that I'm a divorced man and leave the untidy fact that my wife of 22-years sits at home with crippling clinical depression as she contends with her stage III lymphoma. Making such a disclosure does nothing to enhance my opportunity of arranging that first important meet-for-coffee date. Therefore, I go with the plausible divorced man scenario and ride it out until the eventual discovery of my deception. 

My experience has proven that a woman will inevitably ask about my occupation. More times than not, what I do for a living will be included within the first three questions asked by all women. Thanks to the internet, I've been able to research and speak convincingly about the methods and practices of being a day trader. I used to claim to being a foreign correspondent for Reuters until I ran into a woman at Walgreens with whom I had met earlier that day for coffee. I was picking up a prescription of Zoloft for my wife when that unfortunate situation occurred. ( The busses weren't running that day for my wife to run that errand so I reluctantly agreed to drive and pick-up the medication for her) Anyway, I had told her that morning that my flight to Budapest was departing in three hours. I falsely claimed that my assignment editor had just sent me a text to immediately get to Hungary and cover the migrant story. Her surprised expression was telling, so I ignored her. That unfortunate episode forced me to fabricate a new line of work to feed women's curiosity about my source of income. Being a day trader was perfect. It conveys a man possessing intellectual agility, esoteric expertise, and one willing to take calculated risks. Women eat that up faster than the iced lemon pound cake I so often enjoy when first meeting a respondent at Starbucks. Besides, I learned many many first dates ago that woman don't want to hear anything about my real work as a stock clerk at Vito's Liquor Emporium. 

Women, or so my personal history has taught, are interested in my emotional health. This is where it becomes tricky when first corresponding with a potential Starbucks date. It's not as easy as it may appear to conceal my self-loathing, tons of insecurities manifested by neglect during childhood, narcissism, inability to feel empathy, relate to other humans on any healthy level, dramatic and petulant mood swings, and intemperate behavior. I won't even begin to disclose my paralyzing fear of sex and being nude in front of a woman. As a general rule, I don't typically acknowledge my sexual dysfunctions. (With the exception of the visually and hearing impaired woman I met last month, I've never experienced more than one date with any woman, thereby rendering my sexual inadequacies a non-issue) The trouble that I have found is meeting a woman who views those little flaws for what they are: insignificant hurdles on the pathway to knowing me as a person, a man, a Craigslist man. Only then will I ever have a chance to enter into a meaningless and unhealthy relationship that can last an entire week. All I can say is thank goodness for Craigslist. Without Craigslist, my ability to contrive a wildly inaccurate, but affective, first impression would be compromised and all too transparent. 

When asked of my interests and hobbies, I come well-prepared. Reading, or so I insincerely claim, is a passion of mine. I disingenuously state that Sense and Sensibility is my all-time favorite book. What woman could possibly resist a heightened level of interest in a man who embraces Jane Austen? I've never read the book and so I steer quickly away from further discussion about it. I cite other hobbies that are designed to impress and create a flattering, but false, impression. Several of these phantom hobbies include being a self-taught flamenco guitarist, learning Russian, and taking tango lessons. The fact is that my only hobby revolves around lying prostrate on my couch as I deftly use the TV's remote control. Sports programming, loud and violent action films, and reality TV shows consume the vast majority of my viewing time. 

There you now have some of the tile pieces to the mosaic of me, along with my confessions. Whoever said that confessions are good for the soul apparently didn't possess the psychological afflictions that are firmly rooted within me - I feel no better.

Lastly, as a Craigslist man, I'll fight the temptation to corrupt this post by stating that I will now return to Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I need to cash my wife's disability check so that I may stock up on my liquor, smokes, and various snack chips before the Ice Road Truckers TV marathon. 

Sincerely,
A Craigslist Man

missing those days and the wild creative factions that occupied the era.. we were not into capitalism and greed...we had no labels attached to our sexuality... walking barefooted in parks and talking to the trees and birds and all the life forms that propagated the globe...  I'm moving into a space where the rarity of finding other arts folk with their fingers in clay or paint is pretty damned rare!  yeah, I know, a bunch of folks moved up north and got away from the madness of institutionalized humanity... getting back to the dirt of the planet and the peace that goes with it...

looking for some spirited souls to hang out, hit festivals, natural trails and gardens, galleries and coffee shops, beach walks and loud laughs before we surrender our shells and hit the cosmos again.... put on some old Dylan music,  open our minds up and laugh about where we have been and where we are going...

no abstracted minds seem to be around the local senior centers that act more like slave camps for the aging than social hangouts!!  I don't live by the common custodial rules of a culture built on lies, but I'm not quite 'off the wall'!!  I still draw and paint and make things

I'm here looking for new friends outside of my work circle, a friend to go to burner parties with and dance the night away, partner in crime if you will. This is a little unconventional for me to do something like this but I'll try and be as specific as possible and will respond back to those I feel are a match. I am an asian/white female, early 30's, live a pretty open minded lifestyle and bisexual. I would prefer to make friends with someone who understands that part of me without feeling judged. I'm not interested in making any new friends with girls who are attached or married because unfortunately all of my current friends started being homebodies because of their significant others. I'm sure there are girls who are the exception but I prefer to make single friends for now. I'm 420 friendly, very fit and environmentally conscious, an artist and musician, dancer, lover, giver, and most importantly open minded. If you can relate, write me back and let's play it by ear. I enjoy being kind to strangers and hopefully this will be the start to a great friendship.

I am just looking for a real friend and you would think that would be easy but it's not because too many women play games or lie on here. Now I am going to be straight up though I am looking for just a friend that doesn't involve sex but I would like her to be thick with a big butt. You may ask me why no sex and my answer to that is I decided to be celibate, and then you may ask why does she have to be thick with a big butt and my answer to that is because I love to flirt with a thick woman. I am looking for a woman who I can flirt with but most importantly somebody who I can connect with and communicate with, somebody who I can text and talk with who I can go places with like the Exploratorium or go bowling, shoot pool, play mini golf, and ride the BART some places to hang out with. I read a lot of ads on here so I must say that if you answer this then you must meet these criteria:
-Single
-Older than 18
-Drive
-A legit job or looking for one
-Not an escort
-Have goals and dreams in life
-Actually have time for a new friend
-Actually like black men
-Real nice
A little about me is that I am 6'2 single no kids have a job and I drive I am stocky football player build brown eyes full lips deep voice facial hair.
Oh I forgot to also mention please don't think you're thick if only women have called you thick because most of the time women don't know what thick is or having a big butt is so just for reference sake I put up pics of what men thick is a thick woman with a big butt lol.

I have an advanced college degree and love engaging conversation about lots of topics (education, learning, innovation, creativity, relationships) and love to try to understand why people do what they do -- so I love to people-watch. 

I enjoy being outdoors and exploring new beaches along the coast, and the awe-inspiring redwood groves in the mountains. I like photography and love to find cool shots wherever I go, especially ocean photography. I also like to discover new places to eat and have great conversation over food. I like to hang out at home too, and just sit back on the couch and talk about all sorts of things or just read on the couch together. I love to laugh and enjoy finding the humor in situations and life. I've also learned to respect and appreciate the difficulties and trials that come along. 

I don't drink but that doesn't stop me from going out with friends. I don't smoke and am ddf.

I'm looking for a fun, chill, nice, creative, woman who enjoys terrific engaging conversation. If you're artistic or creative, we'll have plenty to relate to each other.

Despite how I write I'm a really silly guy and don't try to take too many things too seriously because of this, plus life's short. I live in Vallejo, but that doesn't mean the woman for me has to be here as well. I don't think the woman for me has to be within a 5-mile radius and it's pretty narrow-minded to think so. I'm looking for a woman who is willing to hang out frequently, I understand not everyone would be and that's find just disregard this whole ad if this isn't you. If it is then keep reading. As far as the kind of women I like I like sweet women who have an innocent side but also a flirtatious one when need be, someone clean of course, faithful, loyal and not a liar. I'm not into married women or women who are still living with their ex or who sleep around a lot. Also if you currently have any friends with benefits I'm not interested. Physically I like a thick woman who has a very large/'huge butt, a lot of women think they do, (or try to give the illusion they do by standing sideways or sitting on a sink), but I've noticed they don't, at least not to my standard. I'm all black; I tend not to care about race too much though.

I don't think what I am asking for in a woman friend is that much but maybe it is when it comes to women nowadays because it seems like women nowadays always gotta have sex in their lives somewhere. Why is it a bad thing that I am not looking for sex? Shouldn't women be glad to find a man who doesn't want to have sex with them but actually wants to get to know them and be in their company? I know what you might be thinking but I am by no means gay I just don't have the desire for sex but I do have the desire for friendship and companionship. I don't know if it is too much to ask but it seems like but all I am looking for is a good friend who has time to spend with me doing fun and memorable things (ex: bowling, shooting pool, dancing, looking at the stars, movies, etc). I hopefully would like to meet a woman who would be my best friend, somebody who I can talk mess to but know its all for fun and not serious. Somebody who won't just disappear on me if something tragic happens in their life and know it's better to have a good friend at those times than to be alone. Also what would be great but not required is to have a friend who is kind of on the thicker side and I don't mean by women standards but by men standards and trust me those are two different standards. I say that because I would like a friend who is ok with some flirting being allowed in our friendship without you developing sexual urges because I found out most women can't.

A little about me I reside in Valleo I am 28 I am 6'2 black stocky build brown skin brown eyes full lips deep voice facial hair, I drive, I work, no kids, don't smoke, or drink, or do drugs. So if you are interested in what I have to say please feel free to reply and not the women who just want to hate or complain about what I said but real women who are interested please type ""Interested"" as your subject title when you email me thanks.

The worst part about falling backward is that we're still moving forward. An ending is a beginning. A tear is nourishing our soul so that it can grow. And Wonderland will always be a place, even if we think we'll never find it again. 

I believe that a body passes through a euphoric state before it dies. I've seen it time and again in the eyes, heard it in a voice, felt it in a hug that we don't know will be the last.

The rain was appropriate on this day. It came to me in a goodbye note. 

There comes a time when I tire of being tethered by my sins, when I give in to the captivity of fate. Death is not always the burial of a body no longer breathing. It is often a transition of our souls into a new realm. For me, it is falling out of Wonderland, leaving traces of my blood on the shards of the looking glass. As I pen my thoughts and move forward, my remembrances keep me in a bittersweet mind. 

The thing is, I like it there. It's where my compassion is rooted; I am more than just the Sad Girl who staggers away from happiness. I am a wanderer and sometimes my journey takes others away from me. It also takes me to places where few dare to go. It makes me unforgettable in a life I am prone to forget. 

""Never say never,"" the note repeated to me. Never comes from the same place as forever. Neither exist with any certainty, do they? Nor do goodbyes when one refuses to commit to it. 

That's my purgatory -- somewhere between leaving and staying.

So.. Here's the situation: I'm a dude lookin for some new friends. Thing is, I've never had a problem makin friends with other guys. Girls though, that's a different story. It may be possible that I've just been introduced to the wrong ones. THOSE ""friends"" normally just wanted to hang out during parties, drink all my liquor and then they'd disappear till the next party. And they'd normally want a free ride to and from the party. Not down for that. I mean, don't get me wrong, I definitely wouldn't mind having a friend that I can drink with, in fact, I enjoy drinkin with my friends, but I'm looking for friends I can also kick it with when we're NOT drinkin.

About me: Half Hispanic, Half Filipino, I like movies, tv, music, art, video games, beer, hanging out, drivin, among other things.

You: Be awesome, like similar things, be around my age like somewhere around 20-30, live near my area.

Fun Fact: If you're a Legend of Zelda fan, we might be besties. If you dislike Legend of Zelda, we might be mortal enemies.

Anywayz, if you're lookin for a new friend, I'm here. Send me an email if you're interested. If you wanna just text first that's cool with me, but I would like to kick it eventually. I'd write more about myself, but I feel that's something that we could talk about when we kick it. Also, I didn't post a pic cause this is Craigslist and I think it's weird, but I'll send one if you want, and I'd want one in return. I mean, I would like to place a face to the person I'm talkin to.

Or you can send me a Kik: S_Flame

Hope to hear from you soon!

We are specifically looking for players that can play either 3b, outfield, 2b, or pitcher.

We are a C-team which means that you must have played baseball and/or softball before and have experience. This is slowpitch softball. 

Let me know if you might be interested and can commit to Thursday night games at Twin Creeks in Sunnyvale. Cost for the season is $135.

you're more simple than complex
aren't too into material things
can laugh
can talk
can cry


i'm from the midwest. i'm almost 6 feet tall. basketball is my favorite sport to watch, golf my favorite to play. i'm very random, will say the most random things and am pretty outgoing. or i can just be chill. it all depends on the situation. i like hiking a lot too. or just sitting and talking....or listening because i know that the majority of females like to talk.

I am seeking platonic fatherly cuddle from someone who is emotionally secure, confident, thoughtful, and fairly established in life with his own place in which we can cuddle with. Why would you do this for me? Hmm.. probably because you know how it feels to be support-less in a man's growing up against the odds of life. Maybe you enjoy being an inspiring and supportive person in other people's lives.

I am educated and well traveled. I am always looking for fun and adventure, I enjoy walking around the city. I also like going to museums, movies, farmers markets, antiquing and great resturants.

...I'll be doing it either way. It's just so much more pleasant to do it with someone.
You see, I spend most of my free time alone. Working crazy long hours, being on call on the weekends. Chores. Responsibilities. Obligations. Having the time and energy to put into a relationship just isn't in the cards for me right now.
So what's a healthy, virile, youthful-for-his-age man to do? He can't just ""hold it"". He needs to release, mentally and physically. It's healthy. Necessary. Inevitable. So what does he do? Why, he takes matters into his own hands, of course. That's all well and good, but having some company would make the experience much more gratifying, whether you participate or just watch. Sharing the experience with another human being makes all the difference.
So, I'm going to do it anyway. Would you like to be a part of it?

The feeling of being needed but not wanted. Relied upon yet in a constant state of neglect. Forgotten about and left to survive, together, yet in a separate reality of solitude. 

The intense pain of intentionally avoided embrace, the forgotten feeling of simple touch, mutual nurturing and inner peace. Pain within the soul, more intense than any nerve ending would register. 

The simple act of exchanging a smile, a genuine hug, together on a park bench hand in hand. Never destined to lead to love, sex an urge forgotten, two people in pain, healing together, a friendship of mutual energy exchange, souls recharged.

And neither should you. The sanctity of marriage is something we've created in our minds to address what seems to be a state of disorder. Some of you know this to be true and giggle about it as you browse these personals with your ""Bestie"". 

But you return to the vicious circle, a sucker for punishment. A life of servitude with little focus on the best things in life. A constant battle to silence your intuition. 

Oh, I can almost feel some of you begin to extend your claws, poised for attack. But I'm impervious! A layer of thick skin and a suit of chain mail and fresh filters installed. I speak not to the woman reading this but her innermost ""questionable"" desires. 

I won't sit here and dictate the sort of arrangement or relationship I'm looking for. It's far too dynamic. If you are a bitch, we will feed off of that and address it aggressively. If you are sweet and submissive, we will take things slowly and enjoy terms of mutual respect. If you are lonely and in need of attention, prepare to feel wholesome but don't expect a one way street. 

So get busy! Quit spending your morning coffee browsing ads and write something meaningful instead!

Hello reader. I am looking for someone. Someone who, like me, has come to the realization, gradually and reluctantly perhaps, that while their life checks all the boxes one might hope to check and they are generally happy, they are not quite entirely fulfilled. 

They need something more. They have a tiny yet constant itch, somewhere in the back of their mind that they cant quite satisfy. The itch reminds them of a sense of excitement they had once upon a time. A sense of curiosity and intrigue that doesn't often manage to co-exist within the familiar and comfortable domain of a long and established relationship.

Just seeking to share trials and travails without judgment, make a new friend and someone who one can speak their truest thoughts, about the marathon called life.

If you're like me, you feel like an empty shell of what you once were.
Your passionate soul, whittled away by life's trials and relationships, is but a dry husk now.
Wouldn't it be nice to rediscover your sensual, playful, spontaneous side again?
It doesn't matter what your relationship status is.

It just matters that you want more.


Lets be 'human beings' and not 'human rushing to doings'.

Hey there!

Are you also involved with someone, who at one time may have been exciting but no longer is? Not just sexually (though that may be a big deal for you), but emotionally? Have you drifted apart, yet stay together for your own reasons? Would you like to commiserate sometime over coffee? 

But seriously, I'm a handsome (maybe I'm bias), tall, average-built, also involved, 40-something, looking for a similar ""ear"" to share stories and even secrets with. I'm witty, intelligent, very cordial and considerate, love probing questions, and enjoy deep conversations -- especially the most controversial subjects.

This isn't about sex (unless of course we absolutely have to) since intimacy is a very interesting thing and can only truly be enjoyed when an emotional connection is made. At least that's how I feel. Let's just leave that part out for now and see what happens . . . 

PS ... I won't hold you responsible for not liking me, physically or otherwise, especially after the critical picture swap. We are complex creatures and like what we like. The end. :) 

Did I lose you yet? If not, I am 100% real and serious. You should be, too. And bots/prostitutes: DO NOT ask me to ""verify"" myself on your ""free"" site. I've not raped or killed anyone, nor have I thought about raping or killing anyone - ever, but thank you for your efforts. You should put your sales skills to better use. Think of the possibilities . . .

You are open-minded, intelligent, active, humorous and honest.

You know how to laugh at yourself and are naturally playful.

You welcome the depth of a philosophical discussion while also embracing silly banter.

Your mind works quickly, and you are sure of who you are and what you want.

To me, your race, age, or physicality is not important. Your self-confidence is.

I am fit because I thrive on being active. I'd like to find someone who is as well. I find that men bring a unique perspective, and I appreciate that.

I am a married mom who, like so many others, is looking for a male friend with whom I can engage in a transaction that ignites me.

Let's start the conversation in email, and if we connect, continue by meeting. If we decide eventually to meet, please be in/close to the South Bay.

Hola everyone!

I'm an avid anime fan and I'm in the area of berkeley this week

I am planning to rent out a hotel room for the sake of holding an all day anime party with one person and me where we'd be down to watch anime, play board games, discuss and critique animes, and endulge in the free room service drinks that the hotel I book offers (they only offer free room service to rooms with two people or less)... So free drinks!

Animes I have on deck are :Digimon Tamers, Kill la Kill, Summer Wars. Clannad, Gate, No game no life, or whatever you'd recommend

You can also bring one friend over too so as long as they're an anime fan or love board gaming

Let's hang out and no worries you don't have to pay for the hotel room I'm booking I get a HUGE discount on it and it's so cheap anyway

You can help contribute to this party if you like, just propose it in the email, you can text me too!

friendship with the opposite sex! Harry met Sally suggested it's a slippery slope, and maybe it is, but that's what makes it ... er ... exciting. so ...

so here I am
I work long hours 
most of my colleagues are guys
lots of friends , good banter 
stress , pressure, deadlines, blah

so methinks friendship with the opposite sex may add color to the otherwise drab drab existence. no?

I enjoy serious stuff (politics, elections, primaries, philosophy, literature) and I like silly stuff (comics, cartoons, sci fi, fantasy), Jol-el, Kal-el, Donald Blake (who's he), Doctor Strange (""by the mystic mazes of madness"" lol) and the ONE RING TO RULE THEM ALL ... heck i like the outdoors. running in the rain storm, bicycling in crazy cold. and so on. how about a 50 mile bike on a Saturday morning.

Hi!
I have actually been dancing Salsa for a number of years off and on but now I am getting back into it in a more serious way. I take private lessons from some of the Bay Area's best female and male Salsa dancers but these lessons only take you so far - I think it is important to practice regularly. Sure, I go out dancing in clubs but dancing with a regular practice partner (or two) would allow me (and you, perhaps) to progress even faster. Don't hesitate because of my age - I am in great shape as a lifelong cyclist and health enthusiast (which does not prevent me from indulging in life's pleasures from time to time!). And, I have a good sense of humor, am bi-lingual (French) and in general love to have fun and enjoy life's little (and big) pleasures. Salsa music makes me want to dance, and especially the Cuban variety (Timba) - I love it. I don't understand the lyrics, of course, but I find that for dancing it doesn't matter all that much - the key is to find the downbeat, hold hands correctly, maintain your frame and keep in step while executing turns, moves and combinations (hopefully with some style), right?

I am 5'11"" tall (150 lbs) so ideally I am looking for dance practice partners a few inches shorter than me - say, 5'5"" to 5'9"" or so. Please be at least at an Intermediate level with some pretty good dancing experience already in either Cuban or LA style, which will facilitate our compatibility for practicing. For example, you should be able to execute double turns, checks, hammer locks, barrel turns and/or a number of the standard Cuban Casino routines (dedo, setenta, sombrero, sencillo, el dos, el beso), just to name a few capabilities you should already possess.

In replying to this message, please tell me a little about yourself and why you like to dance. 

Thanks for reading this and regardless, I hope you enjoy your Salsa dancing, however you choose to pursue it!

I realize this may sound like a weird post, but I have no idea where else to post it. Doesn't quite fit in casual encounters or M4W because I'm not necessarily looking to meet or establish a relationship. In any case, please bear with me and if this isn't your thing, kindly ignore it and move on.

So admittedly, I have a fetish for sheer nylon stockings and pantyhose. I don't wear them myself as that does nothing for me, but I love seeing women in them. I don't have any friends that I'm aware of that share this fetish, therefore, no one to talk to about it. Just wondering if there's a woman here on Craigslist that may share my fetish and are interested in talking about it. Again, I'm not necessarily looking to meet unless we're both compelled to do so. We can just exchange emails or chat on Kik.

The pattern of my life is not always bad, I did have chance to get the best in some aspects, but in terms of career, my pattern is unfortunately always down. I never had a boss who truly recognize my value, there were always mean and rude people at work, and they always think they can command me. I always do shitty work without getting proper credit, not able to form ally, no office buddy. Maybe I'm untactful, but I've seen people less tactful than me and they had better luck to have good boss and be happy at work. For me, go to work everyday is like go to hell, still I need it to make a living. I like to work, if I'm being appreciated, and get to show my value. Really want to meet the right one to have good friendship with and be good business partner to do something I like to do, life would be more joyful and meaningful than now.

So.. Here's the situation: I'm a dude lookin for some new friends. Thing is, I've never had a problem makin friends with other guys. Girls though, that's a different story. It may be possible that I've just been introduced to the wrong ones. THOSE ""friends"" normally just wanted to hang out during parties, drink all my liquor and then they'd disappear till the next party. And they'd normally want a free ride to and from the party. Not down for that. I mean, don't get me wrong, I definitely wouldn't mind having a friend that I can drink with, in fact, I enjoy drinkin with my friends, but I'm looking for friends I can also kick it with when we're NOT drinkin.

About me: Half Hispanic, Half Filipino, I like movies, tv, music, art, video games, beer, hanging out, drivin, among other things.

You: Be awesome, like similar things, be around my age like somewhere around 20-30, live near my area.

Fun Fact: If you're a Legend of Zelda fan, we might be besties. If you dislike Legend of Zelda, we might be mortal enemies.

Anywayz, if you're lookin for a new friend, I'm here. Send me an email if you're interested. If you wanna just text first that's cool with me, but I would like to kick it eventually. I'd write more about myself, but I feel that's something that we could talk about when we kick it. Also, I didn't post a pic cause this is Craigslist and I think it's weird, but I'll send one if you want, and I'd want one in return. I mean, I would like to place a face to the person I'm talkin to.

Or you can send me a Kik: S_Flame

Hope to hear from you soon!

Thanks for reading my ad and I am glad I caught your attention. I went back and forth with how I ought to title this ad and finally landed on advertising for a ""special discreet friendship."" This is my first foray into the world of seeking such a friendship since being married. I am simply interested in making my life a little more exciting, giving it an extra kick, having some intrigue. While I am still very much attached to my wife, the passion has somehow slipped away and my relationship has dulled over time. It is very comfortable, but not exciting. Do you feel that way? It may be that you and I just email each other some spicy titillating (although respectful) emails; it may be that we decide to discreetly meet and chat over coffee/tea, or maybe explore things further if we are both mutually inclined. There are lots of possibilities. As far as I am concerned, we can't go wrong...

I am a Caucasian man, tall, attractive, stocky, gym-goer, early fifties, advanced degrees, professional, live and work in San Francisco, clean-cut, respectful, and very discreet. I would love to hear from women -- married or single between the ages of 25 and 60 -- who, for whatever reasons, want to engage in a friendship in which all limits are respected yet at the same time exploration is in the cards (whether that be through e-mails, meet ups, etc.). I am honestly very open about how all of this might unfold. In the end, I do not wish to negatively impact my marriage and I don't want you (or your spouse/partner) hurt in any way; this is a very important value I hold dear and to which I am committed. 

I hope you are further intrigued by reading my ad and I hope to hear from you. I will reply to all who respond to my ad. Please tell me a bit about yourself (age, description, and any information about yourself that you would like to share) and what compelled you to answer my ad. What is your situation at the moment? What would you hope for out of a special friendship like this? I'll promise to get in touch with you soon.

I very much look forward to hearing from you... To know for sure that your email is not coming from a (ro)bot, please put the name of your favorite city in the subject line of your email. Thanks again and I hope to hear from you.

I also like reading, journaling, the beach, seafood, animals (especially all cats), rainbows, waterfalls, etc. I don't mind a little flirting, but a little tact would be nice.

The principles of Tantra are fundamental for a healthy, mature approach to life, and the things you will learn about yourself and your approach to intimacy will empower you to change your life for the better. Our goal is to learn, understand and experience following:

- Live authentically and true to our self 
- Live healthy and attract quality people
- Enhance self awareness
- Develop sensual sensitivity
- Manage and Heal from past trauma and abuse. Overcome internal blocks
- Retain sexual energy, channel it to pervade all areas of your life and move to higher state of consciousness

I have some experience with the practice, interested in enhancing experiences and enjoy the host of benefits for our overall well-being. I'd be interested in a partner who is patient and eager to learn about this practice. I'm clean, very respectful, and spiritual.

I'm looking for partners to practice the art of Tantra. It's the art of connection and patience that involves trust building, yoga, touching, massage and mutual gazing. 

Age, race and body composition are unimportant. What's required is a good introduction! Please be, intelligent, adventurous and conversational.

Like the title says, I am looking for a someone to just hang out with and have drinks with tonite. Not looking for sex. I have not been in a relationship for a while and I miss the feeling of affection towards the opposite sex. I am hoping we can start of with a simple drink and then spend some time chatting etc...

Are you an Indian Desi or Middle Eastern female who hates wearing underwear? Whether you are home or working in some office or going out shopping or to park etc., you basically just hate it.

I am an Indian male who is fascinated by Indian women like these. They are so bold and have no fear.

I want to talk / chat / exchange emails with an Indian desi female in the age group 20 to 45 who hates wearing underwear. It is so sexy going commando. Are there any Indian females like that in the bay area? 

Lets exchange emails an stories. I want to know how you did it, when you started it, how you feel about it etc. and much much more. Please reply to my ad and while replying change the subject to your favorite movie.

I'm a journalism student in the area, and I'm hoping to write a story about the Craigslist community and some experiences that users have had.

Have you met a friend through Craigslist? Ever met someone for an activity through a posting? Do you often post on forums or use rideshare? I'd love to talk to you about these experiences!

Whether the experience was positive or negative, I just want to meet people who have used the ""community"" section for a perspective. Age, gender, etc does not matter.

If you'd like to talk, we could meet at a café nearby or some other public place. I would take some notes, but it would mostly be a casual conversation, no interrogation. I am free throughout the week and most weekends.

Thanks for reading and I hope to meet some of you in the near future! :)

I posted a while back about looking for Catholic woman to be a Bible study partner with and someone to occasionally go to Mass together with. A very nice woman responded and we contacted each other through Craigslist. We communicated a few times. Unfortunately, we did not share contact information and the last time I tried to contact her I could not because my post time period had expired. If you are that woman please contact me!
Others can respond too. I am 68 year old single man who is a devout Catholic who is looking for a Bible study partner and someone to occasionally go to Mass together with in San Francisco. This is STRICTLY platonic. I just like woman and and am very comfortable with them.

You're attractive, mature, married, settled, outwardly content and not the type to answer an ad like this... and yet...

You wonder about a discreet friendship with a tall, handsome, married professional who shares your worldview, experience, pleasures and challenges... you wonder about getting together once a week or so to share experiences, without the expectation of anything more... you wonder about having something special and completely your own to look forward to and cherish...

I've been exploring CA for years. I've been to Death Valley eleven times and I especially, love deserts and wide open spaces.

I'm a very youthful retired late middle-aged woman (I have many friends in their 40s and 50s). Road trips for me include easy hiking and exploring local towns' thrift stores and shops. I'm quite flexible about duration of trips, from day-trips, to one or two nights or longer. My biggest problem in retirement has been finding women who have the time, money and desire to hit the road without much of an agenda. 

I have a wide range of interests and I love to laugh. I don't get my knickers in a twist over much. I'm a writer and big reader.

You must be able to pull your own weight and share expenses such as gas and lodging. 

Spontaneity and a sense of humor and curiosity are absolutely essential. 

The point of road trips is to take a break from daily life so please be able to disconnect from electronica except for basic checking in with relatives and such. I don't want to find myself staring at the top of your head as you text and photograph your food.

Let's talk and meet and see if we're on the same page. The days are getting longer and I'll soon be rarin' to go. I have a brand new Kia Rio and a GPS. It's easier if you're in or near San Francisco, but not essential.

I'm not averse to tent camping, and still have my equipment.

Anything more people seem to forget their safety checklist and drive like idiots. I'm retired military so my schedule is pretty much open. Don't have any age requirements you can be younger or older doesn't matter. Just tired of riding alone. If this is of any interest Drop me a line and we'll take it from there. Does the weather gets warmer and the days getting longer I'm looking to do some big trips opened Oregon Washington State Idaho let me know what you're interested in. Thanks for looking at the post .Joe

Hello,
I am looking to find some friends that like similar music to myself. I love music and have found it hard here in the bay area to find people who like music that I do. I am originally from Europe. I have plenty of male friends, so I would like to gain some female friends that also enjoy music like: Rammstein, Alice in Chains, Cruachan, Korpiklaani, Eisbrecher, Oomph!, Mad Season and more. Most people I have met in the bay area are into pop/hiphop/rap/indie rock type music and I do not like those styles at all. I know its a long shot, but hoping to find a person or two who would enjoy discussing, listening to our type of music, and possibly becoming friends and hanging out. 
It doesnt have to be just the bands I listed, I was just picking out some favourites and giving an example. I enjoy bands from these types: Folk, Pagan metal, metal, rock, classical, ""grunge"" era types, and more. 
About me: I am a 30 year old male, very easy going, love nature, certain sports, hiking, animals. I am originally from europe. Tall and slender-average weight if that matters at all.
I don't mind what age you are or anything like that, just looking for a female friend who enjoys the same music and style of life.

Hi - If you are a woman, unattached, over Age 50 and like what you read below, I would like to hear from you with a little background and your personal goals. Plz attach a photo before requesting mine. 

A little about me: 

Relocated to the bay area from NJ/NY, in 1979. Yes, I miss the Big Apple and hope to go back and visit. 

Mild-mannered gentleman, College-Educated, non-judgmental, non-smoker, Fit/Healthy, romantic, financially & emotionally secure. I grew up travelling throughout Europe and the Middle East, because my dad was a international bank executive tasked with helping establishing bank branches, in many major cities in Europe and the middle east. I finally landed in NJ/NY area in 1970. My college and grad schooling were in upstate NY (Troy, NY).

Started my semi retirement, in early 2014.

My friends describe me as fun to be around, respectful, well-rounded, witty, calm, honest, compassionate, kind, sensitive, romantic & affectionate.. there are few more, I hope you discover'em! (Nooooooo, I am not near perfect - nor trying to be).

The outdoors, gardening, cooking, dancing, ethnic cuisine, sunsets, music, the theatre, classic movies, travel, moonlights.... & Life are among the things I enjoy.

I am fluent in French (the language).

I am not deterred by body type, religion, skin color or ethnicity so long we connect comfortably and harmoniously. I have a catholic background, but I am not fanatic about it. Among other components, I find Balance, Kindness, Sanity & Harmony are essential in Life.

My taste in music gravitates around Jazz, Classic Rock, World music... 

I prefer a romantic candlelight dinner with music, by the fireplace, to watching TV.

Please do NOT request a photo unless you've already attached yours. 

Happy Day!

Hi,

I'm here for a conference this week and don't have any plans tonight. So I was hoping that there might be a lovely lady around my age that would be interested in seeing a movie with me tonight. 

I promise that I'm sane and fun. Just your run of the mill business professional with time on his hands in a foreign country (I'm from Canada).

I can tell you more about myself when you reply. Please tell me something about yourself and what movies you would be interested in seeing. 

Bye for now! I'll talk to you soon :-)

I know that most people only browse CL for entertainment value...to see if anything can still shock their jaded sensibilities, but there are messages of genuine substance to be discovered...even here. 

I'm looking for the woman who is unhappily married but who needs to stay married for practical reasons. The woman who lacks intimacy in and out of the bedroom. What I don't want is lunch time sex. I want a woman that has the flexibility to experience life with me outside the bedroom as well. I want someone who I think about when I wake up in the morning and when I lay down at night. I want the woman who makes my heart sing when I hear her voice on my phone or get an email from her.. 

Making love is incredible when relationships are nurtured and emotional bonds are formed. I have no plans to leave the marriage that I'm in -- it's just too complicated -- but I'm not willing to live out the rest of my life unfulfilled either. 

There must be a woman who finds herself in a similar situation -- a woman who is ready to build a long-term, secondary relationship. 
Honestly, the concept of an affair seems quite easy. Two attached people make a decision to mess around and well the rest is history. However, the more complicated question is how do those two attached people make it known that they are open to such an arrangement.

About me: 

Others would typically describe me as being laid back, very funny, considerate, respectful, spontaneous and at time shy. I like sports , reading, beach/camping, independent and mainstream films, dancing, hiking, road trips, Cooking, Cricket and good restaurants ( who doesn't). But I would trade them all for a night of warmth and cuddling at home in front of a good movie and some great take out food... Care to join...(wink)


About you: 

The woman I am looking for married like me but is starved for intimacy and ready for a sensual and cerebral adventure. I am discerning and patient; this is only worth doing if it really feels right. She has darker hair and eyes...maybe olive complexion...she might be of Latin, Mediterranean, Asian, or mixed heritage. For that matter, she could be a striking brunette of any origin....the dark features are just my preference. She is fit and feminine. Her hands are soft and graceful...they fit nicely in my large grasp. 

Naturally none of us should be into games or one-nighters! If we are on the same page about what we want, send me an email -- possibly to explore this discreet, adventurous new friendship

Hey guys, I'm Binky. I'm looking for a new friend who have the same interests as me. I love watching anime, listening to Visual kei, J-rock and J-pop music (especially Johnny's Entertainment), and love talking random things about life. It's really hard finding people who listen to Visual kei as well like I'm going to The Gazette's concert in May and got VIP but none of my friends know about them at all so I'm going alone.

I wished I could find some decent friends I feel like people don't like me I'm really a good person the people I work with always exclude me out . I'm never invited to join in unless they include everyone. They have their own click well it would be nice if I can find my own click and have fun hanging out doing things with females like getting pedicure nails hair done shopping maybe even going out to drink or getting out dressing up I have a lot of dressy clothes but no where nice to go. No parties or anything fun. Anyway I know I probably sound like a whiner but I'm just trying to find some female friends I can't make friends on Facebook although I have over 750 people I don't know locals on my Facebook. Well if you want to make a cool friend let me know

Hi.

First, this is a very peaceful, contemplative, and respectful practice of exploration. There is none of the nonsense you see on TV. The energy is very 'light', and is more about 'reverence' than anything else. Hard as it might be to believe, we have had some very unusual, and very unexpected success on a multitude of levels.

I have personally been doing this research for quite a few years now, and only been out in the field locally the last 3 to 4 years. Having headed out in the deep Marin terrain awhile back, a partner and myself discovered, quite by accident, some pretty compelling evidence of either visitations, or, outright habituation right here in the county. Having asked a few people I know I could trust, as well as using the BFRO website for historical references as to Marin events regarding possible Sasquatch incidents, there seems to be a very solid, and ongoing precedent for what we found. Unfortunately, the BFRO has taken down the references to any, and all Marin occurrences since they started the show 'Finding Bigfoot'. No surprise there, I guess. Anyway, it seems that some areas of the Marin watershed are indeed privy to visits in the same manner as is found in many parts of the greater north western states. 

My buddy John and myself are extremely grounded, fact and evidence based investigators when we have the time. Unfortunately, John has very little times these days to make these trips out to these 'Hot-Spots', as it were. Thus, I am looking for someone who has at least some knowledge of the subject, respects the subject at hand for what it is, and is also grounded, compassionate, caring, and respectful of the environment. Someone who can also remain 'Mum' on the areas in question. We do NOT seek any publicity, and prefer the findings of this research to remain within the circle of trusted people in the local community, of which there are very few thus far. I do however, share information on what we find with 2 of best investigators in the field. Again, in complete, non-public confidence.

Anyway, if you are interested in knowing more, and perhaps taking an excursion by car, or bike to some of the easier areas to explore where some great evidence has been found, then please write back to me with whatever you feel is appropriate that I should know about you. This is not an exclusive 'club' by any means. I can also assure anyone that the chances of a 'sighting' are basically zero. But, the vast area between upper Muir Woods, to the far end of Kent Lake in Lagunitas DO seem to have something very interesting going on on a fairly consistent basis. 

Please let me know your thoughts, experiences, ideas, even second-hand stories. The Sasquatch is not the only thing of a cryptid nature living in the hills of Marin as I, and many others have found out over the years. But, there is indeed some very fertile territory for new discovery along certain lines that the vast majority of people, even those interested in this subject, just know absolutely nothing about locally.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Why not?

And yes, we are and should both married or attached...but in need and search of more since we cant really change our current situations.... I guess we have already this in common if you are still reading this ad.

I'm not alone I bet... Life is way too short to keep losing time as we are getting older everyday...

I am hoping to find a nice and sincere woman... a wise woman...attractive too...

We can find ourselves in situations that seemingly have no end. My wife has become more of a roommate than anything else. Circumstances that I will not go into here prevent me from leaving. Been together for a long time and now we just pass each other in the night. There are stupid arguments, stupid fights, no ugly but dormant. 

I am looking for a confident, friends with benefits, or anything with passion. I want companionship, friendship, communication, mutual respect, trust and caring. I'm looking for someone, preferably married, who may be in a similar situation and looking for a little something more in their life. Let's be each others friend, companion, confidant and possibly lovers if it goes that far. Communication is key with me. I like to exchange cute emails and chats during the day. It's simply a lot of fun because I'm a also romantic at heart. I'm not looking to be your new husband nor am I looking for you to be my new wife. When we can, we'll steal moments away with each other.

I'm an educated hard working professional, funny, discreet, humorous, caring, polite, respectful, laid back person that knows how to treat a lady as a lady. I'm a romantic and caring person. I like to engage in funny give and take conversations with a bit of humorous bantering. I'm a passionate person who is missing much of that now in my life. I would like to meet and be with a special friend on many levels; intellectually, compassionately, as good friends that share and confide in each other and also passionately. I'm a good listener and very sensitive to the moods and needs of those close to me. Affectionate and caring. I keep my self in decent shape. If everything works out fine it will blossom into a nice romance.

Please be between the ages of 35-50, live in the Bay Area, easy going (with a sexy personality), decent shape as I am too. I am mostly open to most nationalities as long as they are respectful however I'm most attracted to Caucasian even thought I'm not.

Hello February...

I am in search of an adventurous travel companion for 2016. Someone reliable that has the means and the time to travel the world. I've been many places and want to keep it going. Close people around me have obligations that don't allow them to have as much free time as I do. Let's chat.

We can swap pix, meet, and knock out that travel bug

I'm a college educated native to the Bay Area but enjoy traveling a lot and meeting new people. I work my 40+ hours , I'll go out for drinks, I work out a lil bit, donate money and time to charities, love the outdoors, indoors, music, movies, and mayhem. I can vibe in the streets or in suites.

I am looking for a road dog to have good times with and open to gay, bi, or straight buddies. Anything from drinking and gaming pals to helping each other hunt for action and getting into trouble. I live in the East Bay, so it would be nice to have someone to hang out with and vibe. I've notoriously been a good wing man since I have no problem talking to ladies and usually go to regular bars (too bad I'm not really into women, but lately I've been curious hahaha). I could really use some guy pals though, just throwing this out there into the universe to see what comes back.

If you are interested in chatting, hit me. I won't bite.

Hello there,

I am seeking new friendship(s). Looking for someone who enjoys some of the same interests as I do and also to learn something new.

I am interested in psychology, learning music, and going to the gym. I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, going to the beach, and just walking in general. I also enjoy going to the movies or staying in, reading, and playing card games with good conversation.

E-mail me and let's connect.

How nice would it be to know you are reading my note, here and now! Pondering, as you continue to read my missive, should you reply and take the chance to go on a wonderful quest of discovery.

I am currently in search of one special attached woman to connect with on a multitude of levels beginning with open communication and intellectual exchange. While I'm not adverse to the potential of developing something more, all good things come to those who are patient.

I am a well educated, successful, world traveled, attached, caucasian professional with a dynamic personality and a warm heart. Others have said I am kind, thoughtful, attractive, a caring man.

If you are curious to walk down the path of mutual discovery, send me a note and tell me a little something about yourself. I look forward to hearing from and about you. Let the adventure begin.

Hello,

First of all, I'm not looking to hook up. I like to go riding and my girlfriend doesn't always want to go. Therefore. . .. here I am. I like to cruise for an hour or so then get a bite to eat and go back home ( sometimes hike around once getting to a spot) today I took my terrier/chihuahua but I prefer a person. I like foreign bikes. I hate American bikes. I recently traded my KZ1000 for my dream bike: a 1981 Honda Silverwing. Shaft Drive! I don't do wheelies nor can my bike perform like that. . . I did all that crazyshit when I was in my 20's If you ride with me you must wear jeans. . ... no shorts, skirts, or skimpy leggings. As much as I love to check out nice legs I don't want any unsafe motogear. I have a passenger helmet, gloves, and jacket. 
Ideally I'd like to go to Yosimite and back. . ..3 hours each way though. . .. I'd only want to go with someone that is into it. In return I want someone to participate in route planning otherwise I'd just cruise the Bay Area Spots I know. Also, if you want to learn to ride I'll show you( free of charge of course) I'd like this to be an interactive experience. Anyway if ur interested hit me up. . ... By the way the photo is of and old school moto project not my daily driver

Hello,

1st I'm not looking for a girlfriend or hookup. I like to ride my moto and my girlfriend doesn't always like to go. I usually like to go out on my days off Sunday and Monday For a coupe of hours. I am into older foreign bikes. . .. I hate American bikes. . ... If u are into that u'll be dissappointed. I like foreign bikes from late seventies to early eighties. I have a dream bike now, an original 1981 Silverwing. . . a true diehard Honda. I don't do the wheelies or stunts, nor can my bike perform like that. I just like to ride for a bit. . .. get some food and ride a bit more. also. . .. if you are looking to learn how to ride I can show u, no charge. . ...I almost forgot. . .. . . if you ride with me you must wear jeans. . .. no shorts, skirts. or skimpy pants. . .I don't consider that safe. . ... I have a passenger helmet,jacket, and gloves. . .. . . I really want to ride to Yosimite and that is 3 hours each way. I've only done that by car.
Well if this appeals to someone hit me up. . .. . ... I may ask in return that whoever wants to go does some trip research. . ... otherwise I'd just be cruising the Bay Area spots I know of.

So I'm looking for that fun partner in crime, to join me on some adventures. I am on the pulse for a lot of interesting things to do in the area, but most of my friends are not as adventurous as me, or they live out of the area. I am not really looking for anything in terms of a relationship right now but just someone fun, male or female around my age with similar interests to hang out with and have some fun adventures!

Some interesting things that I am in to:
-I am 33, living in the San Jose area but enjoy traveling up to San Francisco, LOVE hitting up Pizza Orgasmica and Smugglers Cove
-I work in the high tech industry for a well known bay area tech company so I am pretty into nerdy tech stuff, I attend the Makers Faire every year and am a four time Burning Man Vetran
-I love Disneyland, it is certainly my favorite ""weekend getaways"" and I have a season pass that I just renewed last month
-Just got into home beer making, started a home brew a few weeks back and just recently kegged it up, its a very tasty hobby
-I love live music, especially free concerts! There are a few shows I would really like to hit up in the next few months
-Been restoring a 1966 Mustang over the last few months, hoping to take it out to some car shows soon
-Just getting into DSLR photography, would love to meet someone who has experience or an interest in that too
-Enjoy all kinds of movies from indy flicks to blockbusters, but don't really ""go out"" to the movies much as I have a pretty cool set up at home (was a film/television major in college)
-Love doing outdoorsy things, like the beach or this really cool park near my house that I have been itching to go hike in!

So those are just some of the things I like, it would be cool to meet someone who has similar interests but also some cool interests of their own, I am always down to try new things, its just a lot more fun with other people!

There are times when I stop and imagine how cool it will be for me to have someone to talk to or hang out with when I'm stressed or just need an escape from my daily routine. Someone whom I could just have a glass of beer, wine, champagne (or even tea!) and talk about life, watch TV or listen to music. Enjoy each others company, and perhaps advice each from a different perspective.

Who I Am
I'm a 33 year old Hispanic, born in Mexico and raised in California. I'm a university graduate, professional business owner. I have high ambitions in my personal and professional life, and I like to stay healthy and fit. I like dressing nice, and I'm often told I'm good looking by both gay guys and female friends.

Why it'll be an escape for me
I am attached. Before you judge, please know that it's all about perspective - you are not in my shoes. I even feel a bit embarrassed to write this, not because I think I'm doing something wrong, but because I know how the average person looks at this. My relationship is good and healthy, however, we are often too busy to pay attention to each other. 

I need something more. I would love having a healthy friendship with a female I could trust. I do have friends (both guys and girls) but most of them already play a role in my circle, and are mutual friends with my significant other.

Who I can connect with
I feel like I can connect with female between the ages of 25-40. Being Mexican is a plus since I know we would have a cultural connection, however it's not required. I would love someone who is professional, healthy, non-smoker/social smoker only (420 okay), who likes to take care of herself in mind and body. 

Drama free please. I have no drama in my life and I would like to keep it that way.

I would think the person I can connect the most with is someone who is also going through the same situation - being attached but needing an escape / companion outside the daily routine. However, if this is not your situation, as long as you can understand mine and not judge, I would be okay with.

That's it!! Is it too much to ask??

If interested, please tell me about yourself and why you think we can connect. A picture would be nice :)

You have to be intelligent, educated, somewhat attractive (sorry, but not obese).
If you are mature - great!
I'm in a marriage that is dead and serves only the purpose of logistics, so this has to be discrete *for now*.

Hey there diaper dwellers! I'm an Adult Baby that recently moved to the Peninsula area feeling really lonely. I migrated here due to job relation as a graphic designer. Considering that I'm relatively new to this side of the bay, I wanted to establish some new friendships--with other ABDL's of all genders, who share my interest in Age Play and Regression. We can meet at a coffee shop or some public venue initially, and see what develops. My goal is to start a new chapter, with a new circle of friends who can relate to this obscure lifestyle.

Platonic for the fact I'm not just trying to ""hook-up"" - I'm certainly not a eunuch.
I can be brilliant and outspoken at times, but I'm most comfortable just being an ordinary, average guy. I don't go to bars or clubs because I don't much like drinking and I'd really rather just be home watching a good movie or cooking something delicious. I occasionally like to challenge the rancheria to a few hands of blackjack. 
If you're in the market for a nice guy with a car, job and his own place, please drop me a line to say hello and ask me anything you'd like to know about me. 
I'm very real, not into games, and just want to find a kindhearted lady who wants a loving relationship that lasts a lifetime. Looks and body are a distant second to your personality. I'm also somewhat of a private person and I don't feel comfortable posting pix of myself on sites such as this. That's why the side/rearview pic on my posting. I'm happy to send more pix once we've chatted a little. Please live in Santa Rosa, or nearby.

-- Somewhat brainy (interested in books, current events, art, etc.)
-- At least minimally interested in sports (playing and watching)

-- Enjoy coffee/tea

A long time appreciator of good wine and friendly conversation I've attended this event many times and without doubt it's one of the best (second only to the Dry Creek Passport event). I'm a fun, open minded, knowledgeable guy who loves to laugh, chat, read, drive, sail, create, write, produce and much more and is committed to healthy living. In other words, I'm not going to get drunk but instead talk to wine makers, hang out with interesting people and see how the previous vintage wines are coming along.

I'm seeking a fun, witty, intelligent, trim, fit, young or youthful woman who may or may not have attended this event. The information about it can be found by doing a search for ""Sonoma County Barrel Tasting 2016"" You'll notice there are two weekends so I was thinking of a Sunday only on the second weekend

I'm single, mature, fun, lots to talk about and willing to drive leaving from Marin. 

I have not purchased tickets yet and this is not an ad for sex, Sugar Daddy or anything similar. In other words you get your own ticket and we enjoy the experience as friends. I know the wine valley very well and as Rain Man would say ""I'm an excellent driver"". 

I'm tall, fit, fun, smooth head, green eyes, trim, playful, intelligent and casual. This is about friendship and enjoying great wine in one of the most beautiful wine areas anywhere.

In the last year and a half, for valid and not so valid reasons, my eating and exercise routine have gone off track in a bad way.

I need to get back into things and while I have some (tiny bit) discipline in this sort of thing, it would help tremendously to have someone over the next two months to buddy up with to keep things on track.

I don't need someone to meet and exercise with me, just someone to talk to and keep the fitness dialog front and center. Someone who might appreciate the same and we can both be accountable to each other until we get to our goals. 

I have a full time job and that keeps me busy, but will make time to set up some kind of program with you. I'm looking to start the whole 30 program on March 7th - if you're interested, I'd be happy to tell you about it.

If any of this interests you and you either want to help me out or need the same motivation, reach out and say hello.

Seeking Experienced Raquetball Partner-Player (For Periodic 1-on-1 Games @ S. Rafael YMCA)

My ability? I am experienced and fit, probably rated a 6 or 7 out of 10 by an ""innocent bystander"".....yet I am nowhere near expert level...but I am athletic, fit, quick, and competitive.

For example: Please note I often beat people in their 30s and 40s. I am 56. 

Times/days to play? I am flexible on days/times. Please tell me what times/days work for you and I'll adjust to your schedule....though my ideal weekday times: 9:30 10:30, 11:30, 12:30 & 1:30 pm, 5:30 pm & 8:30 pm ....and on weekends: 9:30 - 6:30 pm on Saturday (any of the slots work) and 9:30 - 5:30 pm on Sunday (likewise, any beginning time on the 1/2 hour works in this time range).

Thank you, Daniel

Hello,

Single, Black, , 40-years young, plus-size (/fat/BBW/thick/curvy/zaftig/rubenesque, etc. Whatever they're calling it this week. Feel free to enter your own nomenclature here) woman seeking platonic male friend. 

An off the cuff list to describe me: quirky, cool, liberal, laid back, intelligent, engaging, fiery, fun, sociable, sophisticated sassy, creative, classy and kind.

I miss having an engaging, intelligent, enjoyable male to hit the town explore and have fun with. I'll be creating a list of adventures I'd like to enjoy this year: movies, festivals, concerts, cocktails, dinners, plays, scotch tasting, the casino, camping, vineyard wine tasting, comedy club, volunteering. Play golf? Show me how. Play poker? Teach me the tricks.

We can wing one another. I'll teach you the secrets of seducing a lady. I'll wing woman you at a local dive bar. Heck, I'll even accompany and help you get into Twist. Whatever floats our boat. 

Need a Clyde to my Bonnie. Interested? Send a message.

No bank robbing, though. Promise.

Hi, I'm looking for hiking partners in the bay area. I'm open to meeting either men(I'm straight) or women. I'd do the ""meetup"" thing but they're just too crowded and very casual; having a real conversation/connection is nearly impossible.

My favorite hike's are in Mill Valley but anywhere in the north bay is great for hikes. Pacifica is also full of great hikes. The hike I find to be the most grueling is Mt Diablo, especially in the summer when it's hot out. My go-to hike is San Bruno Mt, and I can usually string those trails together for 10 miles.

As for me, I'm 35, fairly athletic, an ambivert(introvert/extrovert) if I'm going to put a label on myself; I'm friendly(people actually tell me this) and outgoing, but enjoy the peace and calm of nature. I'm a great listener, great at communication, into psychology, and the human condition. I'm well traveled and can converse with pretty much anyone who speaks my language.

My best friends are married with children so they aren't available as much as I'd like them to be, and I broke up with my girlfriend 6 months ago so I'm still figuring out how to occupy that time she filled. Not heartbroken if that's what you're thinking. Let me know if you'd like to meet, thanks

Well hello.
I'm sure there are many of you who work long hours or more than one job. Those like us have almost no time to socialize. The good thing about the internet is that you can meet anyone at anytime when it's convenient. Maybe it's my curious energy but I am excited to make a new friend thru CL, a virtual pen pal. After all I'm not looking for a GF because I don't have time to date either. Would be nice to trade a few emails over the week... and more.

Thanks!

If so, tryouts are happening tomorrow, February 28 at Balboa Park, Sundberg field (next to SFCC, 2000 San Jose Ave, San Francisco, CA 94112). If you can't make it to tryouts, please respond to this posting if you want to play and can't make the tryout. 

I manage the ""Sting"" of the 30+ age division. We are still looking for a few good players who want to play baseball. If you will be 30 years old by the end of 2016, if you love and respect the game of baseball and want to put the cleats on again, we want to hear from you. Anyone who has played organized baseball, particularly at the high school level and beyond, is encouraged to contact me for more information (ESPECIALLY pitchers and catchers!) 

FYI: anyone 21 years & older can play for a team in the Bay Area Mens Senior Baseball League (BAMBL) in the 21+, 30+, 40+ & 50+ age divisions. (Note: if you're older than a given age division, you can play in a younger division, but younger players cannot play in older divisions etc.) Please note, there are league fees involved (so we can rent fields & pay for umpires etc.) Games are on Sundays in April, through mid-September. Don't go soft(ball), play hardball this year! Email me now for more info and let's schedule a BP or throwing session!

I'm a desi man who works close to Grt Mall. I do visit there once in a while, either to just roam around, walk and window shop, or sometimes eat in food court when I'm alone. It is good to take break from work and stretch yourself.

However, it would be even better if I could meet someone who also visits Grt Mall, preferably another Indian woman! I've had many men friends, its time to gel with a woman. I am a good conversationalist, erudite, refined, classy and well traveled and well read. I would love to find an Indian woman who is bored during daytimes and visit Grt Mall, and also looking for a friend herself. 

We can have lunch together, take a walk together, get coffee, gel etc! We can be friends. Time pass during work day. Like an hour or two. Just unwind! I am seeking a daytime companionship and you too! You may be single or married doesn't matter. I'm married myself and my personal life has gone stale and I need a new friend. Your life needs a friend and distraction too. 

After some time, we can go together and window shop at either Coach or VS (you know what it is) or any other store. I might even think of spending for my lady friend.......

Why don't we connect? No harm right?

I am looking for a female friend to do things with primarily on weekends. Dinners, symphony, sightseeing, tennis, hikes, you name it. I am a widower and my teenage kids tell me ""to get a life"". I have not done anything like dating since my wife passed away 5 years ago. Besides my kids, friends are telling me essentially the same . I am a supervisor where I work and the job keeps me mentally on my toes. So sometimes I just like ""chilling"" by watching a movie so we don't nessarily have to be out on the town every weekend. I am hoping whomever I meet opens me up to new sights and activities.
I am fairly open minded and not judgemental. I can debate any topic with you as long as we stay civil and respectful. I'd like to end any discourse with a smile. After all, the purpose of having a friend is to enjoy something together not to convert a mind to your thinking.
I posted in Platonic because a lot of the m4w postings are weird, drug loving or frankly are far more into sexual activity than I 'd like to go into least initially. We can stay platonic or get more involved but the impetus for deeper physical involvement will have to come from you.
I am looking for someone over 40 though I'd take a look at a younger lady of course. If your interested send me a picture of yourself and tell me a bit what you like to do for recreation. Also, I am not interested in more commuting so please be in San Francisco or within 15 miles. I will reciprocate a face picture in kind, body picture in kind and so forth. Thank you for reading the post and I hope to hear from you even if it's for one date only.

I am need of some serious advice. This is strictly platonic. I do not seek anything else. Please do not flag this, I am really serious.

I am a 20 year old male. I have had a few serious relationships, took things slow, built a friendship and went from there. No relationship has lasted past the first few instances of sexual interaction. 

Two years ago I also developed a symptom that earlier this year was medically diagnosed as hyperspermia. 

In short, my body produces semen at an abnormal rate that makes me produce large amounts every time I ejaculate. I am serious. I don't mean that I produce ""large"" amounts as is the guy with the big inflated ego that thinks he's hot stuff. When I say I have been medically diagnosed, I am for real. I have been to the hospital (male urology dept), where I undertook a series of tests. I had to give samples twice a day, three times in a week, over 5 days. Whereas the average male produces around 1 teaspoon of semen, I consistently produced between 7 and 8 teaspoons, hence the hyperspermia diagnosis. 

In my personal life, this has been horrible. Every girl I've been with hates it. I makes messes. I overfill condoms (making dangerous messes, reproductive-wise), and have lost every relationship in the last two years. Girls think I'm a freak and I've been accused of taking drugs or supplements to make this happen. I don't.

Am I doomed? Will I never have a girl take me serious? Are all girls grossed out by this? I don't blame them. Like I said, I make a huge mess. It's embarrassing and I'm ashamed. Am I doomed? Does anyone know what I can do?

Any advice is greatly appreciated. 

Thank you,

James.

Hello,

I'm posting here in platonic because it seems a little more tame than M4W.

I'm a easy going, non judgmental, decent guy that is clean cut and would like to have a sweet Asian lady around my age to do things with.

It would be great to have a special person in my life.

It would be nice if you live around the Berkeley, Oakland, Alameda area.

Here are some of the things that would be nice to do with you;

go for a walk, bike ride
go to dinner together, make dinner together
see a movie
jazz clubs
hike in the woods
take a ride to the north coast for lunch 
work in the garden
puttering around the house
Zellerbach Hall
Point Reyes

I live a healthy lifestyle and am a very light drinker.
Love being outdoors, I'm handy

If this sounds interesting to you and you would like to know more about me.......

Always Good Luck

Hey local diaper dwellers! I'm an Adult Baby that recently moved to the Peninsula area feeling really lonely. I migrated here due to job relation as a graphic designer. Considering that I'm relatively new to this side of the bay, I wanted to establish some new friendships--with other ABDL's of all genders, who share my interest in Age Play and Regression. We can meet at a coffee shop or some public venue initially, and see what develops. My goal is to start a new chapter, with a new circle of friends who can relate to this obscure lifestyle.

Hi, 

Shall we?


And yes I'm married as well as you should be if you are reading this...but in need and search of more since i cant really change my current situations.... I guess I would like to find someone with the same needs

I'm not alone I bet... Life is way too short to keep loosing time as we are getting older everyday...

shall we?

We can find ourselves in situations that seemingly have no end. My wife has become more of a roommate than anything else. Circumstances that I will not go into here prevent me from leaving. Been together for a long time and now we just pass each other in the night. There are stupid arguments, stupid fights, no ugly but dormant. It's impossible to talk. Who would understand? Who would even believe? After all, we're the 'Perfect Couple'. We are what everyone envision as the 'perfect' marriage.

I am looking for a confident, friends with benefits, or anything with passion. I want companionship, friendship, communication, mutual respect, trust and caring. I'm looking for someone, preferably married, who may be in a similar situation and looking for a little something more in their life.

Let's be each others friend, companion, confidant and possibly lovers if it goes that far. Communication is key with me. I like to exchange cute emails and chats during the day. It's simply a lot of fun because I'm a also romantic at heart. I'm not looking to be your new husband nor am I looking for you to be my new wife. When we can, we'll steal moments away with each other.

I'm an educated hard working professional, funny, discreet, humorous, caring, polite, respectful, laid back person that knows how to treat a lady as a lady. 
body : average height : 5-10

age: 45

Imagine the possibilities...

You are in a marriage or long term situation that has lost something. . . that special connection that brought you into the marriage in the first place. You have tried so hard to connect with your spouse yet you realize you are the one doing all of the work. The intimacy is gone s you stay because of family obligations, a financial situation or because that is what you do. . ..

You are looking for someone to share your thoughts and desires of the day with -- someone who is open, honest and willing to have a real conversation - someone who will look forward to your IM or emails. Someone who can provide a special connection only two people can understand.

We will take the time to really get to know each other through conversation. We would care for each other - we might even find that we crave each other in every way possible. We won't be rushed and we won't settle and we hate hook ups. Right now we just need each other because want and need a positive relationship in our lives.

This can only happen if we find each other.

Don't like to build up stories for self, so shooting straight. I am an entrepreneur from Palo Alto, a 35-year young single dad and a happy person. But yes I do feel like spending some time with that pretty someone some time. Not looking for sex, need someone I can flirt with, talk to share anything under the sky etc etc... Not a boring guy, like driving a convertible with top down, full heat in winters, bunk work to watch a movie, in a nutshell a fun person. And yes, if things go well, I definitely miss that kiss in life.

I am a East Indian, living in 94025, like my stubble, like the simplicity in life. In short structured but not boring.

Let's plan to meet for lunch/coffee soon.

So I moved here about a week ago to live with my dad.
He's the only family member I have left and we never had a relationship growing up.
But he wanted me to come here and stay with him until.I get back on my feet and can go home to take care of my OWN kid...who I love and do everything for and call twice a day. ...anyway...

I showed my dad a photo of my son with me for the first time when I got here a day or so after arriving. 

He flipped. Called me a nigger lover and said I needed to find somewhere else to go.... Said he's glad he didn't raise me cause at least now he can't feel any blame for me being a race traitor.... Seriously. I've never heard this kind of rhetoric spewed at me before. Yes my son os mixed. His momma is black and I'm white... And my son is the most handsome little boy that ever lived so I don't care that he's darker than me...

Anyway now I have to get back to Pasadena where at least I have a few couches I can sleep on until I get some income rolling. I've tried for almost a week to do it here and find a job and a temporary place to stay but nothing has happened for me. People won't hire me on the spot and I have no clue how long this could take.

Now I'm soaking wet and really tired of hanging out in Starbucks all day to stay dry. 

I'm posting this in hopes that someone here can put me to work or something. I need to earn my ticket back to Pasadena. It's roughly 75 and I'm dwindling every day I stay here. I may have less than twenty in the bank by now.

I'll do anything for work. At home I've always worked in cLl center's but even with the absence of a man raising me I still know how to use some tools and fix some things.

Anyway. Please put me to work. Km ready to go to my friends in Pasadena and fake a shower and sleep a whole night.... Dry....

Women are empowered when they embrace, own and worship their sexuality.

The connection to our sexual selves is what turns us from females into radiant Goddesses and it is also what awakens our bodies to an array of powerful and healing sensations.

Yoni means ""sacred place"" in Sanskrit; it is another word for the female vagina.

A Yoni massage is an internal massage of the vagina that is part of the sensual Tantric massage. It is a full mind, body and spirit experience; it is empowering, healing and awakening and it is a celebration of all that we are as females.

The massage is a far more mental and spiritual experience than it is physical, therefore it is experienced differently depending on the emotional and mental connection to it at the time. It is a pleasurable gift that needs to be given very slowly as it is a deep expression of love.

Our physical, spiritual and emotional health are all connected to our sexual organs, therefore, if there are any blockages due to toxins, our Prana/Life force also known as sexual energy cannot travel freely through the body.

During a Yoni massage blockages are released, toxins are broken down and the blood flow is increased to the sexual organs. Female ejaculation often occurs during the massage, which helps to further release any negative emotions and also it clears the sacred space to allow a deeper level of sexual pleasure to enter.

Please email me your information and let's go from there. I am a 37 yr old 'normal' spiritual woman looking to expand my experiences in massage therapy and energy healing.

I am an amateur artist who draws male nudes from life.

Models tell me they enjoy the relaxed, informal session. I do everything I can to make you comfortable.

I draw quickly, so you do not have to hold a pose for long.

You do not need to have posed for an artist before.

The drawings are erotic but not pornographic.

Sometimes the model becomes aroused, but that is not a problem.

If you'd like to pose and take home your favorite of the three 9"" x 12"" pastel drawings I'll do of you, please send pics showing your face and giving an indication of your body. I do best with men of slender, regular, or muscular builds.

And maybe tell a bit about yourself, and about why you'd like to pose.

If I think I'd be able to do some good drawing with you as a model, I'll send more information about the session to you. 

(I hope to be able to say ""yes"" rather than ""no"" but as an amateur artist am somewhat limited in the types of faces and bodies I feel able to draw.)

I have a cat, so I hope you are not allergic.

I am a 34 years old, professional Italian that soon will be in SF for a month.
I will spend my nights alone, and I would love we to share the same bed to fall asleep.
Nothing sexual.
I wish you could be in my arms, we both laying down in bed, my arms wrapping your body, my head on your hair, smelling the fragrance of your skin, my lips kissing your shoulder.
We can spend all night this way, you can sleep like an angel protected into my strong arms.

Hi,
I am here in bay area for a few weeks for work. The climate is cold and wet and very much of the sorts that is making me wanting to spend the cozy times with someone in intimacy on the bed. I have never been fortunate to have such a time with anyone in my life. So when I would tell someone that I am 36 years of age, they wont believe. But there is no reason for me to lie here while posting this. I could have without any hesitation said that I have already had such times as it wouldn't matter. But it is the fact I am stating, believe it or not. However someone might wonder that why is it so. So the reason is that I am very shy by nature and hesitant in approaching any girl. Long back I approached one girl and fell in love with her, but unfortunately it did not work out, and I did not even kiss her or even hug her due to my shyness. And after that there wasn't any drive within me for a very long time about such a thing.Apart from this, I have another problem. As soon as I would spend sometime with someone and be in the friend zone with the lady, my shyness would not be able to make me ever courageous enough to ask her out and secondly, intelligence attracts me much more than physical beauty (in parameters of my own evaluation) and so once I get to know someone more and don't find them intelligent per my parameters, I tend to loose interest in even inclining myself toward her.

Anyway, the whole point of posting this ad is that I don't wish to die without experiencing that intimate encounter with a beautiful lady but at the same time considering the fact that its really hard to find such a perfect match, I don't wish to go for any sort of relational strings attached. I don't want to spend enough time with each other that it leads to any sort of judgement on each others' part as well. 

Having said that, I think its a very long shot, but I would still post here, what I am looking for. I am looking for a while lady (age does not matter but I would prefer plus or minus 10 years of my age), who is independent and can host and would like to spend some 2 -3 hours in her bedroom with me with both of us cuddling and may be this intimacy leading to some nice time together, but with no strings attached and only one time. Please don't be attached, as I am not interested in breaking someone's love nest. Given that I am not a white myself, its a further long shot. But I am 5 '10'', single with a light skin, 70 kgs in weight and not bad looking, if not too handsome. 

If there is any lady, who might find any interest in my post, I would love to hear from you. I am sorry I cannot host as I am staying in a shared accommodation. Also, even though I have a car and I can drive, I would not prefer to come by car, as that would lead to a lot of questions from my colleagues staying with me with whom I dont want to share all this stuff. So perfect setting would be, if you could meet me at some public place nearest to your place, for coffee (where I can come by BART or CALTRAIN), preferably on a weekend (sat / sun). We can talk a little bit over the coffee and you may evaluate if I am good enough to take home. If you don't like me then we can say goodbye from cafe itself, else we can have some cozy and nice time together. 

Thanks for taking time to read this. Have a great day.

I'm looking for someone who is interested in an ANR type relationship. If you don't know what that means it stands for adult nursing relationship. Its a friendship or relationship based on the intimacy and bonding of cuddling and nursing on a woman's breasts. It is not based around sexual activity. It can be the most relaxing, natural feeling cuddle session you have ever had. If done correctly and often enough you can even begin to lactate but that can be talked about further and doesn't have to be the goal of this. Please message me for further details and to get to know each other.

I feel that this type of relationship is about sharing oneself completely with the other in the most intimate, caring, and relaxing way, and building a special bond with that person. Not only is it intimate but it has mutual health benefits as well. I am single, my kids are grown and on their own. I am open to a long term relationship.

I firmly believe that ANR/ABF is the closest that two humans can be. Unlike some, I don't believe that ANR/ABF is a fetish. I believe it's a way for partners to grow and build an ever stronger, closer bond WITH each other.

I would like to find that woman, who desires the bonding that ANR/ABF creates.

You know what? Truth is the best way to deal with anything in life. It makes things easier and fair for the other person. First of all I am married but my wife hates to travel. You know what is it that I would like to do this spring? Go to sequioa, yosemite and walk! Just walk! Go to the highest point and walk. I am fit and even though I am not your perfect male body I do enjoy a good talk with an honest and fun woman. I would invite another man but seriously... Men are no fun unless I'd want to go out drinking and to tell you the truth I just don't trust other men. Women on the other hand are fun and more honest and safer. So, Thats all I want. Just a fun talk with a fun person while we travel. 

I do not want lies or deception. I feel that it doesn't do just for the other person and so I don't want to do anything done to me that can come back to me. If you are married it is ok too and I promise to keep it fun. Only fun. If you are not married then at least you know the truth and I am not hiding anything but again I care for fun times. Laugh and run and climb to the highest point of a mountain and YODEL! Or Shout! its the same thing. Want to YODEL with me? 

Thank you for understanding but I am simply being truthfull.

It's a bit different, I know, but I'm missing a dad-type person in my life. I never had one growing up and didn't think much about it, but curiously the impact of missing out on that role model is just now hitting me in my 40s. But you don't necessarily have to be older than me to fill the father role; it's in the attitude.

I'm looking for a man who is strong (mentally & physically), masculine, healthy & reasonably fit to do physical activities, 35-55, kind, educated, good-natured, has integrity, and single (my married friends have little time to get together). If you want companionship, someone you can show and teach your interests to, and you're left of center or willing to let politics alone, we may be a fit. I'm a 5'4"" guy, go to gym, active, friendly, compassionate, sometimes childlike in a good way, playful sense of humor, loyal, want to spend time with a man I can look up to and respect. 

The level of mentorship is up to you...you can be a full-on Dad type and have guidlines, a more casual big brother, or something in between. I just ask that you take the lead in what we do, as I need to relinquish planning for a change. Does not need to be romantic/sexual; being friends is fine. Open to what you like...hiking, camping, kayaking, sports, beers, wine, live music, traveling, hanging out at home--almost anything. Pass on your knowledge/skill and have someone enjoy your world with you on your terms, and let's have fun together!

Hey how are you doing I hope your new year has been good so far and if not maybe I can change that by offering you 2 choices. A: You can decide to get to know me and that would be a very smart choice on your part because not only am I tall dark and handsome but I can show you how a real friend should be treated and appreciated. I know I am a great man that will show you great times with great fun and great laughter. B: You decide not to get to know me and that would be the worst choice you would make because you will be missing out on a man unlike the others who could've kept you smiling and laughing that didn't bring you drama. So what choice do you choose?

I like a woman who is thick a nice curvy shape
A girl that has weight but most in the right place (wink)
She is looking for a friend not for a soul mate
She makes time to hang with me even with a full plate;
'm not looking for sex I'm not horny like a rabbit
But if you got a big butt at least let me grab it
Also don't be mad if it turns into a habit
But I will treat you with respect that part comes automatic;
Im not looking for a woman who only wants money or sex
I just want to spend time I don't want to spend your checks
I want a woman who won't hesitate to shoot me a text
I'm a whole different man don't compare me to your ex
I can't seem to find a nice thick woman to save my life
Because they are either gay, mean, ghetto, or someones wife
Do I have to sag my pants or flash my ice?
Or do I have to be the same color as rice?
I want a woman friend who can twerk that would be perfect
A beautiful woman not just on the surface
A woman with a warm heart not as cold as this earth is
I am a goofy guy but not a clown at the circus;
I don't want no grimy females not with the ratchet
Or straight fake women who name should be plastic
There is a difference between being mean and sarcastic
Also if you have any questions just go ahead and ask it;
Also please don't judge me by my race or my age
I am 28 and black it says at the top of the page
I'm not trying to marry you or get engaged
I just want a friend who would be down to hit up the batting cage;
Ok now that's it I am now finally done
I hope you realize if we were friends it would be a lot of fun
Take a chance in life because you only get one
If this made you laugh and smile then it only just begun

Lets keep a diary of ours thoughts and ideas on how to leave this world having made a long lasting and positive impact. Over time lets build and implement strategies to concretize the thoughts and realize those ideas. 

As I see it, we live in a world that's rampant with inequity, a world where selfish and inconsiderate people outnumber the kind and caring. A world full of people who wouldn't skip a heart beat while bulldozing anyone in their path to success. Lobbyist-puppets disguised as politicians are the norm. Armed with hidden agendas their only goal is to block all progress. Then, there are those that are hardworking. There are two types - those who work hard to ensure a few can build stockpiles of cash, and those who work hard selflessly for the welfare of others, for the betterment of this planet and to be good human beings. I want to be among the latter but I find myself increasingly becoming the former, after all I am a silicon-valley employee and that is how I earn my money! Be my support and I'll be yours while we transform ourselves into the hardworking kind of the latter type.

Even in this age of Facebook, Twitter and Youtube effecting change is a daunting task. Some people believe that technology can solve all our problems. They couldn't be more wrong. Some changes occur in a few years, some may take a decade and some others may take over a century. In my opinion, for one person to bring about change is almost impossible. Two is a team, with a few more we have a force, gather enough people and we have a revolution.

My goal is to build small-scale prototypes that produce concrete results and serve as models for larger scale implementations, which unfortunately may not be realized in my lifetime. I have some ideas of my own to share and would love to hear yours. Lets do something as a team, something to be proud of on our deathbeds. I don't seek fame or fortune, but I do seek the company of others to keep me motivated and on my toes, serving people and this planet every year, every month and every day for the rest of my life.

I moved to the Bay area over 10 years ago and left a large group of gay friends before relocating. I landed in Marin and, though it's a great place to live, have only made a handful of gay/lesbian friends in the past decade.

I am an over-educated, professional guy. Eat and live healthy, practice yoga, spiritual, very laid back, Type-B with a Type-A job and travel schedule. Very extroverted, high energy, social drinker.

My 2016 New Year's resolution is to get out and meet more gay professionals. I'm personally interested in hiking, camping, outdoor activities, social events, retreats, and in exploring other opportunities as well.

It would be nice to have a friend or two from the local area that is interested in getting out of Marin and more involved with the gay community. If that sounds like you, I'd enjoy hearing from you. Perhaps we could meet up sometime, chat, and see if we'd like to hang out this year.

It would be great to go to the movies, take scenic walks, dine out and just be spontaneous with someone who's open to living life without holding back. Ultimately I do want to meet ""the one"" and hey, if that happens here even better but that isn't at all what I'm expecting. 

I've only had one sb/sd relationship in my life and that lasted almost five years. It was mutually rewarding but like all good things it peacefully ended. As you can see I'm looking again for someone who equally loves adventure but can mix it in with a sexual arrangement. I love trying new things and it doesn't have to be all about sex but I do want that as part of the agreement. I'm sure you appreciate straightforwardness. 

I love a girl who can still wear heels when we stand next to each other. Don't count yourself out if you're petite :) I'm over 6ft, cute, tall and considered a handsome man. I'm disease free and will always try to make time for someone who's good in bed and a great friend. I'm looking for someone cute with a great personality, brain, and sense of humor! I'm looking for a long term friend with benefits, not just a one time, nsa thing. A weekly stipend is what I was thinking and I'm good for it.

If this is what you're looking for please share what your expectations for a stipend type of arrangement would be like? How many times a week do you think realistically you could meet up? Are you single? Is your place available some of the time or would we always have to come to my place? When you write feel free to ask me any questions you may have. Please tell me a bit about yourself as well as send some good pictures. I will be happy to answer anything and send pictures of myself.

When an attractive guy has an education and a good job, people ask why is he still single this late in the game? Girls ask specifically, ""What's wrong with him?"" I'll be perfectly honest. I've had back to back long term traditional relationships before having an arrangement and this is something that just works for me right now. I plan on settling down one day but the problem right now is that I work and travel a lot. 

I really, really like my job, and unfortunately it requires me to go places on short-notice. I do a lot of driving all over California and along the West. My schedule gets in the way of dating and this situation works perfectly for a student or someone who has equal needs. I don't think it would be an issue if I had a long-term girlfriend, but it's a big problem when you're trying to get past the first few dates just getting to know each other and the girl discovers that my schedule is just all over the map.

The girl I'm looking for is anywhere between 5'2''-5'9'' with blonde, brunette or red hair. She has blue, green or hazel eyes and is slim and takes care of herself. I'm open to HWP as long as you take care of yourself and stay healthy and active. I love a girly girl but also a girl who doesn't mind getting her hands dirty. I'm open to different ethnic groups. :) 

With all of this said, are you that someone who's open to a friend's-with-benefits scenario while being compensated for it? I'm pretty sexual and frankly it's difficult to find somebody who can accommodate my schedule. I think if we didn't expect a big emotional commitment from each other then maybe it would be simpler. I'm not really interested in being a ""player."" No games. To be honest, I'm not opposed if we do end up developing feelings for each other but that's down the road. Who knows what could happen....

I've experienced more in my life than most have imagined themselves getting the chance to at least try. I'm not bragging, I believe some to do with achievement, and much serendipity. Whatever the reasons, a few remain. 

Today I pondered how many rarely experience the realization of much that's on their list. So here goes perhaps another unanticipated chapter in life that happens just because. 

My posting is directed toward women because I believe my thoughts and spirit quicken more holistically with the soul of most woman. Mind and soul are critical elements that must harmonize for you and I to share in order to achieve convergence beyond even a personal level; beyond finding words for capturing tonalities of the essence of mind that escape as whimsically as they appear. 

No, I'm not a transcendental voyager, or lay claim to meanings of revelations more profound than they are real. What I believe I am blessed with is the capacity toward introspective awareness channeled through empathic sharing of the essential harmonies of life untold. In other words I often experience the deja Vu of things that may or may not occur -premonition of state without basis of their meanings. 

So if you're still with me after my ethereal journey, what my ambition here today is to engage with another toward achieving a significant experience that remain unfulfilled. Something in your bucket list that I may be so privileged to see and hear through your minds eye, that perhaps the two of us can embark on a quest to turn those thoughts into a shared and journeyed reality; a notch in your bucket list you never imagined would ever be there. Namaste!

Please share your thoughts with me!

Getting right to the point this is not facebook...so looking for just friends only here is not the #1 goal. I'm realistic so only respond to me if you can be realistic too. I know most guys online want that 'one thing' on everyone's mind. But I'm different. Honestly I want to take things to the sexual level I'm looking for with you first THEN mix friendship in, to make sure we click on that friendship level after hooking up. I do things my way, not the ""normal"" way. Try to follow along. Why meet for regular ""dates"" just to immediately assume that you don't click with someone only because you're so nervous? 

I like to have fun like most guys on these personals but I also like having deep conversations and making actual progress with someone along the way. So no I do not want what others want for their secret agendas; I want a guy that I can get to know a little first over the phone, go to your house to talk and hook up ON THE FIRST MEET, then be prepared to more than potentially have an on-going friendship with benefits if it's there. I'm more than capable of being real friends with real benefits, and am strongly looking for a guy who can be ready enough to follow my lead.

For hanging out I like movies, hiking, shopping, definitely clubbing, can do video games, walking around town, going out to local eateries to avoid fast-food and more. I'm 5'9 tall, masculine, average to thicker/stocky body build, short hair casual attire. Sometimes classy when going out but still masculine. I'm down to earth, funny, open-minded, outspoken, etc. Please be single and not currently attached to someone like your ex. Save the complications.

I do not send face pics, and I am not into judging looks or appearance. Too many people with fake pics and phony intentions, or robots who are simply pic collectors. We can talk on the phone, connect then just meet in person because I have nothing to hide so why try to stop at pictures? In fact I find that the best connections come from not having high expectations off of looks. Instead of being shallow, just be attracted to a personality, not a picture/looks. Race isn't important to me; however I do like being interracial whether it be friendship or more.... Clearly you should feel the same way. I only expect replies from guys who are open-minded about any race. In example, I love Latinos and Asians (yum) but if someone other than that is ringing my bell, then it is what it is :) For the record I'm a top looking for a submissive bttm to be down with who loves sex...and you be able host when we go further or for plan B in the car somewhere parked because I cannot host. Like under the stars chillin'.

Keeping in touch is key...We all have busy lives--you ARE NOT the only one with a busy schedule. If you say you want to meet, just fucking make the time for it and keep the plans. Or else stay the fuck offline. I cannot stress that enough. And back to pictures, it's annoying to exchange pictures with guys who can't follow through or keep the momentum going...if you're claiming to want even just a friend you should already have the time for them. By the way there's no sure way to tell if someone is a match on day 1. Real chemistry doesn't happen in 5 seconds, it happens over time after discovering there are general mutual interests. I want a guy who's prepared to meet with me a few different times before judging any chemistry.

The only real preference for FWB I have is age...I need a guy around my age who can keep up with me. So 18-29 hmu. But since it's a preference not a requirement, older guys feel free to be bold and hmu if you think we can still be good together :)

Is life is pulling you in every direction and feeling overwhelmed and need a break? What better way to plug in, recharge and balanced than by a therapeutic, nurturing and pampering massage? 

For some this time year can be extra challenging. After all the holiday season celebrations are done, the New Year expectations, family demands, work overload or just life... can leave us feeling over stressed, lonely and blue.

What I offer is a place for you to share, be heard and understood. What you want and need is number important. What you feeling matters to me. You can relax, totally receive and totally let your hair down. You can feel empowered to be selfish and for it to be only about self care and self love just for you.

I am sensitive, empathic, nurturing and 100% unconditionally giving. I have been giving massage professionally for over 20 years and take pride in providing a safe place and service that is completely about you. I love what I do and right now I am humbly offer a sliding scale for those in need. I am not your average therapist and open and willing to work out what can serve your needs best.

My goal is to help uplift your spirits, create harmony mentally, physically as well as emotionally and to always be a place you can count on to be private, secure and discrete. 

Be sincere and real. No time for games or drama. Please tell me your favorite color for a response. I sincerely welcome you to reach out and allow me the opportunity to assist you in creating harmony and balance now and in the future.

Hi. I'm an asian engineer in my mid 30s, and all my coworkers in this male dominated industry are typically just like me, that is, book smart, clean cut indian or Chinese men. 

I'd love to get to know a new friend who's the opposite of me, whom I would have never met because our social circles would never otherwise overlap. I'm looking for someone who lives a different culture and life style, which may seem mundane to you but eye-opening to me, and vice versa. After all, experiencing different life styles make this journey called life more colorful, a la foreign exchange. So, do you have tattoos? Do you speak Spanish? Are you from Taiwan? Are you blonde? 420 friendly? Do you follow a potato based diet? Whatever it is, as long as you're different than me, I think you're cool!

In full disclosure, I'm not that exotic having come here from Hong Kong for over 20 years. But I'm sure my deeply rooted asian heritage and love for dim sum would be interesting to you. After all, if you aren't Chinese, you may feel awkward going into a Chinese restaurant. Am I right or am I right? :D

If you're a writer, you know that when a specific moment engulfs you -- you just have to get the thoughts out of your head. For some of us, it's moments of sadness or loneliness, or the pain is so great that you have no choice but to write about it. I've been there ever since I was 12 so I know how it is. At least for me I couldn't go a day without writing. The pain was too deep and writing was my outlet. For the last 5 years or so I stopped writing. I decided I just didn't want to anymore and believe it or not, there wasn't ONE thing that compelled me to write. I played the piano a bit but writing was gone. . ..Until. . .My health was threatened. The possibility of breast cancer entered my life like from out of nowhere. I had to take a bunch of tests but I ended up OK. While this was happening I had to sit at the Thanksgiving table and act like life as usual when for me it wasn't. Then, my son fell after kicking a soccer ball and got really hurt. I don't want to get into all of that but basically like dominoes one thing after another has happened and keeps on happening. What do you think I started doing? Write. I haven't written as much as I would have because of my extenuating circumstances but I started to write again.

Writing heals, we all know this. Sometimes it's not about our pain -- it's constructed into a short story or something like that.

Being 45 I thought this group, would be great for those around my age. We'll have more in common, I think. But again, it's not a ""pre requisite"".

I created a Yahoo Group called ""Writing Heals"" and it would be great if you would join and give it a chance. I mean, what's the worst that can happen? Maybe you can meet some other people who are going through similar situations and this group could be about healing.

The only thing I don't want to do is LIMIT the type of writing share in this group. It could be any genre. I know for me, as a distraction, I dabble in some erotica. Maybe you did too. 

If you have any interest, 

email me at scarletblack0307 @ yahoo . com and I will send you the link to join. 

It would be an honor to get to know you.

Hello,
I hope this finds you all well. 
I am fairly new to Marin County and know very few people here. I have been hiking all over this beautiful county for the last few months, and to make it that much more enjoyable, somebody to share it with would be phenomenal !
I'm in my 50's but have the endurance of a 20 year old. I am relatively fit for my age and try to practice good health at all times. 
I hope this site works out well for my endeavors, I'm not sure where else to look.

Thanks for checking out my post and happy hiking to you !

Don

Hi! I will be in San Fran this Friday for a long weekend and am looking for someone to show me some not so touristy places. I'm doing some work in Southern California during the week. I currently live in Boston but am originally from Texas. 

I've never been to SF so I plan on doing the tourist stuff on my own, unless you want to join, I am all about it. In exchange for the kind hospitality, I will buy you a couple of drinks and even a nice dinner.

I'm 35, have a job I love, single, and am up for anything! I love being outdoors, can be quite competitive, in good shape yada yada. If you have questions drop me a line. 

Summed up version: Visiting Friday March 18, looking for someone to bar hop with! I'll buy dinner

I'm looking for someone to jam with. I've been playing acoustic guitar for a number of years and have always enjoyed playing with (and learning from) other people. Trouble is, I don't have too many local friends that like to play.

I'm in my 30's and I used to live in Nashville. I'm most influenced by Classic Country, Classic Rock, Southern Rock, Blues, Bluegrass, and a touch of 80's what-not. What kinda music do you play? I'm open to all genres and levels of experience. Please be cool with moderate drinking and smoking.

I live in downtown Campbell and can host. Once the weather warms up, my garage is sort of perfect. I'm also willing to meet somewhere public, if that makes you feel more comfortable. I look forward to hearing from someone cool. 
Thank you for being a reader.

I am relocating to New York and driving all my stuff cross country beginning on 3/21 or 3/22. I expect the trip to take 7-8 days. I have a truck and will be towing my car. My destination is Long Island. Its a one way trip.

I'll be doing all the driving and will only drive during daylight hours. I figure to find a decent cheap motel each night to crash and relax. I'm a laid back single gay guy and very drama free. It would be great to have someone along for the ride to share the experience. We can come to an arrangement for splitting costs.

The ideal guy for this adventure and for me in general is younger, 20-something, non-smoker, outgoing and easy on the eyes. Straight acting or a fem-twink doesn't matter to me as look as you are nice and genuine. If I'm going to be driving around with a stranger for a week its got to be enjoyable. What happens on the road stays on the road.

If interested please get back to me by e-mail first. Tell me about yourself and include a photo. Thanks for reading this and I hope to hear from you soon.

I'd like to meet someone who is local (Vallejo, Benicia, American Canyon), who'd enjoy having a partner to do such things was walks, local hikes, or runs (if that's your thing, it's ok if not). I am posting this in strictly platonic, as I am not seeking more than a friend. I posted m4w, as I tend to have more female than male friends. Your age (and mine) shouldn't be that much of an issue, since this is platonic.

Sometimes, having an activity partner with whom to exercise can help in motivation, and can also make one comfortable taking a local hike, or even just walking.

I live in a nice part of Vallejo. Vallejo has a few decent neighborhoods for walking/jogging (and of course some bad areas). The waterfront can be a good spot. Mare Island has several great areas, with water views (on the back side, away from all the industrial stuff). Benicia State Park is nice (I have a permit to park free there). There are some interesting hiking spots on the hills across from Lowes. And, there's a neat and large county park (with amazing views) off the 80 about a mile north of Vallejo.

If having a friend to do such things potentially sounds interesting, then drop me a line, and let's talk. I would like to meet someone who is up for doing something active a few times a week. Assuming we get along, I'd like this to be a fairly regular thing.

If we develop a friendship, it might also be nice to have someone with whom to grab coffee, attend a local arts/Farmer's Market event with occasionally, and just do friend-type things. But, if we just are exercise partners, that's fine too.

So, I'd say we talk, meet for a walk down by the ferry building, and if we feel comfortable, we can plan some other walks (or a run/hike) and go from there.

Thanks!

Ello,

I'm looking to meet some friendly open-minded people that are looking to make friends. I have a gf so I don't have any hidden agenda in case you're a female reading this and thinking, ""hah another desperate guy, does he think we're stupid?"" I'm just getting up there in age and it's hard to make friends after college ('specially for a bit of an introvert like myself), so I'm just looking to meet some people I can have engaging discussions with and be good friends with. I just don't know many people that like talking about deeper, more meaningful things in life and I'm a junky for gnawlig noa'm what I sayin? For some strange reason I genuinely like learning about other peoples' lives as well.

I have pretty diverse interests, but especially like talking about big ideas so anything along the lines of philosophy, psychology, social science, science, economics, business, intellectual big idea things! I'm a poindexter, I'm irreligious/atheist, I'm not snobby, and I try to be nonjudgmental. I also have an athletic side (martial arts, gymnastics) and can be immature at times (I play in parks and stuff). I don't watch tv or go to movies, just mainly try to be productive or keep growing in some way every day. I'm also pretty loyal to the important people in my life. 

If I sound like someone you'd get along with, feel free to drop me a message! Actually fuck that, I've poured my heart out- you better message me!

Adios muchachos.

I am just simply looking for a connection, I would like to find first a best friend and with the time a girlfriend.
Maybe I went to the wrong places to looking for that special person in my life, I dont want to think that I need to be a prick to find a girl, a friend of mine told me that sometimes women feels attracted to bad guys, maybe could be true in some cases, but thats just no me.
I am the kind of guy who will introduce myself and ask you to dance in a nice way.
So if you like good guys who has respect to their mothers, sisters, friends, family and community, I am that guy :)
I believe that all the problems in the world can be solve if we are a little bit unselfish each day, I have hope in the future.

I work with kids, I am an open minded person, I love dancing, singing, eating healthy, the movies, museums, art galleries, parks, hiking, running, soccer, exploring the city and just enjoying the simple things in life.

Can you hear that?...... Neither can I:) but I can feel it....Time is ticking away.
Are we going to wait forever to experience the feelings of passion and desire again?
Are we going to have to stick our teeth in a glass of water before we can make-out again?
Will our walkers and canes become our new sex toys that we really don't even know how to use?
Can two people even fit on one of those electric scooter chair things without it tipping over in the street?
Is there even a back seat on them for making-out?
I don't want to change my depends, before making passionate love with someone I have a deep emotional connection with.
And, I never want Bingo to be my ""big date"" night either.

My current relationship feels like canes, walkers, and teeth in a glass of water on the nightstand.

I would love to find someone special before time ticks away. Someone that I have incredible feelings for, someone that has these same type of feelings for me. 
I am a healthy white male, in great physical shape. Smart. successful, completely drug and Viagra free......and I love to have fun. 

I am looking for the right woman to spend time, and to share special moments with. 
A woman that I can share a very special friendship with, a friendship that never involves canes, walkers, or those stupid electric chair things.
Maybe we can spend some of that time that we do have left.............together.
BINGO!

The title says all about the intent of this posting. A little bit about me, I am 33 been living in these suburbs for 5 years and being single for one year. Before that I lived in SF for a long time. I do go out often, sometimes I have dinner at the bar of reasonable restaurants and other times I just hangout somewhere and watch Sharks or Giants. I am not necessarily looking to chase skirts all the time, but everything in moderation. A good company with potential for friendship who can hold his/her drink is ideal.

Hi all - 

As many times as I've tried this, I've had little luck with finding other moms who are GENUINELY interested in getting together for play dates, mom night outs, etc. And I really want to think I'm not the only mom out here who'd enjoy some other female companionship. 

A couple mom's who i aas really excited about responded to my last posting then fell off the face of the planet so hopefully whoever responds this time is really interested in a new friend...we're all busy ladies, so let's not waste each others time...anywho...

I am a 27 year old, married mommy of a 4 year old boy with baby boy #2 on the way :) I am educated, employed, opinionated, meat-eating, west coast transplant (from the east coast), honest, non-judgmental, ambitious, mouth like a sailor lol, 420 & drink friendly and tattooed. 

I'd love to plan outings and get togethers from park playdates, to fairs / festivals, groupon/ livingsocial activities, weekend trips, camping, shows, sitting at home doing nothing lol anything goes really - we're open and flexible!

I'm hoping to find at least ONE other mommy who feels the same and is willing to make time to create a TRUE & LASTING friendship!

I have an entrepeurnial spirit and it would be awesome if you did too so we could bounce ideas off each other and brainstorm? heated political debates? there is no topic that is taboo for me. In the near future, I'd also like a workout buddy to lose this baby weight - I'm most interested in boxing / kickboxing, tennis & zumba - but def open to other things...

I ask very little from mom friends but to be yourself and non-judgmental, not a flake & be willing to really make the time for a new friendship...these are the same things I'm offering - if based on my info you don't think we'd get along - then don't reply - simple as that. 

If you're attached, great! If not, that's fine too. 

If any of this sounds at all interesting to you then let me know and I'll respond asap...Hope to hear back soon!

This was an email response I sent to a former post

I've worked at the library as a tech for about 15 years. A huge part of our day is taking care of patrons, both in person and on the phone, who come from a wide demographic. I've received many letters of praise from patrons which I'd love to share with you. I also received a yearly staff recognition award from the library for my excellent customer service.

I also design and make jewelry. I sell and show my work in shops and galleries, as well as direct sales. Running my own small business has encompassed a huge variety of skills.

Over the years I've had other small businesses, both by myself and with my sister. These included a gallery/store called Atelier Posey et Susan; as well as a personal assistant/errand business called go-for-it. As a personal assistant I had a variety of clients, including a psychologist who I did light research for, and a number of individuals who hired me a few hours each week for everything from party planning, home décor, and shopping, to bushiness calls and assisting a landscape gardener.

At times I've worked with SOMAR, an artist resource center who were responsible for putting up the stages at various street fairs. Although I'm a petite 5'1"", this kind of physical work is very much within my capacity.

You can see, I've had a varied and interesting work history.

I look forward to meeting you.

Hi guys,

24 year old female here seeking a similarly-aged friend to get stoney baloney!

This is ad is in the ""strictly platonic"" section for a reason- with no intention for a hook up- but let's be honest, sometimes life is better in the company of a member of the opposite sex. I cannot currently host such a session, but am open to meeting somewhere (in nature!) and eventually getting stoned at home. Life is full of changes, and the most recent change in mine is a mass exodus of friends to other states, leaving me to burn things alone (hence the Craigslist ad).

Likes: nature, big trees, cooking, eating, bong collecting, animals, science!

Dislikes: Donald Trump & cilantro

If you feel like making a new friend, send me an email with a little blurb about yourself. This internet-socializing thing is new to me, so be prepared for a back-and-forth email exchange before meeting up :D

Have a beautiful day!

I have been browsing CL for some time, it's full of weirdos and didn't find what I am looking for. I have a feeling, like me there are many normal, respectable people here.

I've hit the age where everyone I know is married or boring, but Im on the James Bond plan, and I like to go out and get women at night. Clubs/Bars etc. 'I sometimes with go with a few buds, and sometimes alone but would we way more fun to have a buddy to go out with and chase the women. Not to mention makes it easier.. social cred.. 

About me:
age 50, 5'8 fit, white guy, clean cut. COMPLETELY STRAIGHT.. make sure you understand, Im looking for a guy BUDDY to wingman with to chase women. So you should be straight too. 

You:
Somewhat familiar with the night scene.. STRAIGHT. lol I think on CL I need to keep mentioning that. You don't have to be some ultimate gamer for women, but not weird or unkempt. 

Might not find the right friend for this on here, but thought Id give it a shot. When I go out I like to be safe, no drugs, no drinking and driving.. (drinking within reason is ok of course) just have a good time watching women, getting numbers, dancing.. and sometimes bringing them home (not easy).

Hi,

I lost my festival going buddy and the rest of my friends are more interested in the EDM or pop scene exclusively. I'm looking to go to a couple of camping festivals this summer in northern California. I would love to find someone to go with, be it a single person or a group of a people. If you are going to festivals, want to go, or have never been, but are interested, hit me up. I'll get back to you.

Hi guys!

I'm writing a sex scene between two guys in their late 30's. They've been together for a couple years, but their relationship has gotten stale, their sex life vanilla. Then, while on a trip to a cabin in the woods, they feel an incredible burst of a passion, and want to fuck immediately. They have gotten each other fully aroused with oral and are ready to go.

Would they be more likely to take a minute to go downstairs to get lube, or would they stay in the heat of the moment and use saliva?

I have not done anything like dating since my wife passed away 5 years ago. Besides my kids, friends are telling me essentially the same . I am a supervisor where I work and the job keeps me mentally on my toes. So sometimes I just like ""chilling"" by watching a movie so we don't nessarily have to be out on the town every weekend. I am hoping whomever I meet opens me up to new sights and activities.
I am fairly open minded and not judgemental. I can debate any topic with you as long as we stay civil and respectful. I'd like to end any discourse with a smile. After all, the purpose of having a friend is to enjoy something together not to convert a mind to your thinking.
I posted in Platonic because a lot of the m4w postings are weird, drug loving or frankly are far more into sexual activity than I 'd like to go into least initially. We can stay platonic or get more involved but the impetus for deeper physical involvement will have to come from you.
I am looking for someone over 40 though I'd take a look at a younger lady of course. If your interested send me a picture of yourself and tell me a bit what you like to do for recreation. Also, I am not interested in more commuting so please be in San Francisco or within 15 miles. I will reciprocate a face picture in kind, body picture in kind and so forth.

I'll be wearing my tuxedo and top hat, so you can feel free to dress up if you want.

Each attendee will probably get a package of posters; last year there were 18 in the package, the year before, there were 12.

There may be some interesting guests as well; last year Wavy Gravy showed up.

This should be a fun time for all.

If you attend with me, you will be expected to provide your transportation to and from the venue.

I am a single guy looking for a LTR, but honestly I'm just looking for someone to accompany me to the concert, so no strings attached. We don't have to go out again. I would just hate to waste the ticket and deprive someone of Yanni's awesome music. :)

I live in Hayward in a condo I just bought and the concert is in downtown San Jose at 7:30pm.

Hi -

Putting it out there to see who might be interested to join me for a ski trip to Colorado, March 24-27. Plan on leaving SFO to Denver on night of March 24, and return on Sunday night March 27. Ski area to go to could be still to be decided, but Vail is a great area and the snow is always great there. Have an Air B n B in mind, which might be a short drive to the ski area. Plan to ski Friday, Saturday, and Sunday before driving back to Denver airport to fly back to SF. We could split the travel expense, car and accommodations. If you are an intermediate to advanced skier/ snow-boarder then we could have fun skiing together and being roughly the same level. Skiing in Colorado is so much fun and the snow is awesome! Hit me up if you are interested to talk more and see if theres mutual interest....

Thanks!

Trust me...lol...I have friends but moving back to the bay area after 10 years reminds me that I should have kept up with people from High School. Oh well... Its difficult making friends at 28 but not impossible right? I have tried by going out but everyone thinks you have an agenda in a bar so here goes. 

Attractive gay male seeks Cali BFF. No restrictions on where our friendship goes not anticipation for it to go romantic, fresh off of LTR. I am open to you being straight or curious so the whole attraction thing is non-existent or limited. Im a stocky guy but working on getting my pre-east coast body back. It would be nice if you're into fitness and wellness too since its the current kick I am on. Other interest I have include academia, law, books, movies, travel, entrepreneurial endeavors (small business owner).

Hit me up, we will grab a drink and see if its worth getting more drinks.

Here to find a nice buddy to have a decent relationship.

Simple, we exchange a couple of email about us (maybe some pics) and then we decide to move on and to hang out. 
About me: 32 years old, 168 lbs, 5'11"". I am a man, who dresses like a man and likes men. 

About you: know what you want, preferable to be around my age and have some conversation to make.

Reply with your stats and a pic of you (at least) or be ignored.

Shoot me your best offer, or trade. please read everything, especially the eligibility pics.

A chance to be my guest on a trip of a lifetime. I won a skip trip to go to Tahoe, CA (Truckee,CA) on the ALICE 97.3 Sarah & Vinnie morning Radio show. I don't have any friends out here that know how to snowboard or ski. The is put on by CBS RADIO. THIS IS A 100% legitimate auction.

About me:
I'm 25, Male, pretty outgoing, Caucasian, well educated, I'm a real down-to-earth laid back guy. I'm bringing my guitar for their jam sessions, so if you know how to play, that's great. I was a snow board instructor for 3 years, so I'd like someone that could keep up.

I don't snore and I'm not picky at all, if you don't want to hang out at all that's cool too, we probably won't be in the room that much anyways.

Considering that I'm relatively new to this side of the bay, I wanted to establish some new friendships--with other ABDL's of all genders, who share my interest in Age Play and Regression. We can meet at a coffee shop or some public venue initially, and see what develops. My goal is to start a new chapter, with a new circle of friends who can relate to this obscure lifestyle.

Alright, thanks for humoring me and reading my mini rant. Now, with that out of the way, I hope you're well. Relatively funny married guy here hoping to meet someone of the opposite sex for witty banter and soap box-standing rants. Maybe not rants but how about mild flirting? 

If it makes a difference...I'm cute and in decent shape. Just looking to enjoy the types of back-and-forth dialogs that happens between two people that are enjoying the newness of a fresh discovery. How about you? 

To weed out the fakes, please put ""board"" in your subject line. Have a great day!

...and let's see how it goes. 

Let me see if I can write this without sounding creepy or weird. I'm an attached guy seeking someone that's willing to engage in some great banter and if things go as well as we hope, get together for a drink or even possibly catch a movie. If you've got a slightly adventurous side that you're willing to indulge, have a good sense of humor and don't mind hanging out with a fun and intelligent guy, then why not? 

If I was looking to ""bed"" someone, I'd be posting in a different section of Craigslist but here I am, just putting myself out there, albeit discreetly, to see if there's anyone else of the same mind. How's your weekend looking? 

Happy Friday!

Having spent a while looking for a girlfriend now... what I've learned is that it's useless to try. Not giving up on love, just the hunt for it. So if you were born a female, between 26ish-32ish, are not obese, are not high and enjoy doing things, going places and eating... you're perfect! What are you perfect for? That part can be hashed out over time through conversation. And yes... I'm here for a reason... I'm not asking for nor expecting nor tangentially hoping for anything beyond friendship.

I'm not looking for a romantic type relationship, but having a male friend I can talk to can be helpful in many ways and me being female can help you as well.

Hey there ladies!

I am a 27 year old good looking, nice, adventurous guy. My buddy and I are coming up for LA and thinking we might go to the Diplo show or we may just hang out in the bay. I am funny, outgoing and sporty. I am currently in a relationship with a girl and it is really not the best. I am just looking for someone that I can have a great sexual encounter with and if it works out than we can meet up any time I come back up in the area for work. My buddy is in the same boat as me. We are just looking for 2 girls to hang out with and keep it casual and just have some fun and blow off some steam.

If interested, please send me an email and we can go from there. I can send you my pic once you reply.

Never done anything like this before but figure its better to be upfront and get some dialogue going with a beautiful girl rather than just come out and meet her here on the spot. Atleast can talk a bit before we come up.

If you're a married man (or once were) or if you're in a long-term relationship with a woman and you'd like a discreet place to discuss your sexuality and form genuine friendships with similar men, please check out the ""Married/Once Married Men's Group"" that meets weekly at the Pacific Center in Berkeley. It's the only group of its type that meets in the Bay Area.

Although the group is primarily platonic, there have been times in the past when a long-term romance has developed between two members.

One thing the group is NOT is a place to find hook-up partners.

The group is anonymous and the confidentiality of all participants is protected. Current ""regulars"" range in age from 28 - 68 and the average number of attendees each week is nine. Meetings are every Wednesday night, from 8pm - 9:50pm. The Pacific Center is located at 2712 Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley.

I started attending more than three years ago when I was looking for feedback on coming out to my teenage kids. I didn't expect to attend more than once, but because the guys' feedback was so helpful, I returned to tell them how it went. I've been hooked ever since. I've found my tribe - there's no other social group like it. The dynamic is neither straight nor gay, it's somewhere in between.

I'm posting this information, not because the group needs more participants, but because it's a unique resource that hundreds of men have found invaluable throughout the group's 30+ year history.

Hey there!

Are you also involved with someone, who at one time may have been exciting but no longer is? Not just sexually (though that may be a big deal for you), but emotionally? Have you drifted apart, yet stay together for your own reasons? Would you like to commiserate sometime over coffee?

But seriously, I'm a handsome (maybe I'm bias), tall, average-built, also involved, 40-something, looking for a similar ""ear"" to share stories and even closely guarded secrets. I'm witty, intelligent, very cordial and considerate, love probing questions, and enjoy deep conversations - especially the most controversial subjects (with the most intellectually stimulating woman).

This isn't about sex (unless of course we absolutely have to) since intimacy is a very interesting thing and can only truly be enjoyed when an emotional connection is made. At least that's how I feel. Let's just leave that part out for now and see what happens.

PS ... I won't hold you responsible for not liking me, physically or otherwise, especially after the critical picture swap. And please don't pretend to if you don't. We are complex creatures and like what we like. The end. :)

Did I lose you yet? If not, I am 100% real and serious. You should be, too. And bots/prostitutes: DO NOT ask me to ""verify"" myself on your ""free"" site. I've not raped or killed anyone, nor have I thought about raping or killing anyone - ever, ha!, but thank you for your efforts. You should put your sales skills to better use. Think of the possibilities . . . :)

I'll be waiting,

Hi,

I am at the very beginning of forming a Secular Gay Brotherhood. This would be a co-operative, or commune if you like, of gay men interested in living together in community, bonding through a shared philosophy of naturism, education and philanthropy. I always envisioned some form of a phallic worship ritual and/or shrine, but that isn't required.

The group would be very similar to an all male religious group, like a monastery or priory, but would be secular in nature. 

There is an opportunity to obtain a vacant campus of buildings formerly used as a detention and education center for delinquent boys. 

I am seeking committed men serious about forming an active group to devise a business plan, explore funding opportunities, including crowd funding, and move forward to establish the Brotherhood formerly and make a competitive bid on the listed property.

In-kind help and donated services in the areas of: legal, business, accounting and tax, fundraising/development, advertising/promotion and tech/online/social media services are needed.

Please contact me with your thoughts on the project and I'll forward the property details and plans for you to review. 

Thank you!

In Brotherhood,

Max

P.S. Where else should this information be posted?

First off let me start by saying that I am a heterosexual male. However I do have a fetish for male pubic hair. I think it started when I was a teenager and me and my friends will compare to see who had the most pubes at that time. Ever since then I've always associated pubic hair with masculinity and being a man and something to be proud of. It seems like nowadays Women have suggested that man be clean-shaven, basically bald. I've tried it and I hated it LOL. I'm just looking for other guys who feel the same way that I do and would be interested in talking about it and trading pictures of our pubes. Maybe even meeting up and showing each other and even touching but that's as far as I would be comfortable going with another guy. Hit me up if interested.

""People say I'm crazy, doing what I'm doing. Well, they give me all kinds of advice, designed to enlighten me...""

Ever feel like everyone just wants a piece of you, but never the whole you? So, you part yourself out, until you feel like a puzzle, but always missing that one piece. 

I'm here for friendship. Not a hookup, affair, a relationship, or ""fun"" superficial or pervy banter. I don't expect you to spill your details in the first minute - I certainly won't, although I'm a better listener than a talker. Don't even know if we'd ever meet; I won't make promises if you don't. It's not my primary goal, nor an impossibility. I prefer online chatting or texting versus emails if we find there's a friendly vibe.

... maybe we'd like to know each other. If any of this resonates with you, give it a shot. Don't be a cliche, sending your phone number with a one liner and think that will get a response. And Is it apparent that I don't go for platitudes and raging optimism?

Don't know why I'm posting as I know I won't get a response but here's to trying.

So I don't have much friends, not really anyone close to talk to. Although I'm in a committed relationship, I feel an empty void which ceases any motivation to do anything new. Am I just settling? 

I wish I can find a nice pen pal or even good female friend. A best friend. A gym partner to motivate health, A geeky girl for gaming entertainment, a realist to converse with. Share stories, share opinions, and most of all a guide to life. 

I don't know what I'm doing but I'm letting life respond...

I've tried other places, and dating websites to find new friends. But things never work out as they are either interested in dating, or don't believe when I say I'm looking for a friend.

Also if you're interested in chatting or miss the old instant messaging days. Message me on kik oxy1984.

Looking for a woman to share erotic stories and conversation with. Not looking to ever meet. I'm age 50 and looking for someone at least age 40 who has been around a little like me. I have a quite the imagination plus some past acquaintances that lend to some great stories. Here is just one of many:

Shelly and I met on Craig's List. I was not pushy, asked lots of questions about what she was looking for and took notes. Yes notes. We exchanged pictures, texted over a period of weeks and even talked on the phone a couple of times. By the time we met for dinner we knew each other fairly well. We had a nice dinner and afterwards walked on the beach and talked about the naughty things we could not talk about in the restaurant. I asked her what she wore to bed and what underwear she was wearing right now. We progressed to if she masturbated and how often? I then asked about the main subject that brought us togather, what was her previous submissive experience? What did she like, not like, and what else she has thought about? 
We sat down on a bench, I put my arm around her and I asked her if she felt comfortable with me. She said yes. I then asked if she trusted me and would be willing to start discovering each other in a Dom/sub relationship. She said yes again. I placed my hand on her thigh and gently ran it up and down the lengh. As I did it I slowly moved my fingers a little closer and closer to her inner thigh. Adding just a little more pressure to her inner thigh, I leaned over, nuzzled my lips to her ear, and softly whispered ""open your legs"". She let out a gasp as she parted her legs and I could feel her heart beat. I was excited as well as the hair stood up on the back of my neck. I knew we were in for some fun times.

She was so excited that night she broke her rule and invited me back to her place. We had incredible normal sex as I explored her body and mind, testing to see what she liked and didn't. I watched her face and body and listened to her every sound for feedback. This was the ""getting to know her"" sex.

I touched every part of her body and checked with her to see if I was in the right spot. ""Do you like it here or maybej here? What about here? Oh, you like that don't you? Huh, do you? You want more""? She got real excited when I talked to her. She would gasp, breathe hard, arch her back, and make melodic moans. All fueling my fire to keep pleasing her. She was so excited her nipples were rock hard the entire time and we went again and again. I lost track of how many times I made her orgasm.

Afterward she lay in my arms as we talked as I stroked her body. I asked her what she liked most and made some suggestions of things we could try. I told her I would send her a list so she can let me know what she may be interested in. It's about 50 questions, but told her to just do a little at a time and send me what she answered. The list covered everything from anal to spanking to role play. Communication is the key to incredible sex, and even better kinky sex.
To me a woman having an orgasm is the most beautiful and amazing thing a man can do for her and himself. I feel so much like a man at that moment. Like I just brought home the winters meat supply and I am returning to my woman to celebrate. We don't hunt anymore, but I believe those instincts are still inside men trying to get out. I'm all for equality for women, but for me the bedroom is still mine
.
There are more episodes to this relationship and other stories if you are interested.

Every time I wake up - I'm astonished
I resurface from a dream I was lost in
I'm always remembered even if my visions aren't
They remember me - as insignificant as I am, they wake me
You are not finished, the world is waiting
I curl in the fetal position yearning to return to it
Back to that same dream where I was free 
Embracing all the people I will never meet
I never want to wake up, I'm begging please
I am more me when I am gone from this
Unresponsive, unaware of my history
I can jump off the mightiest building 
and enter into another dimension
And whatever pain there feels amazing
Like another heart is forming in my chest
trying to make room for its sheer depth
Dripping gorgeous words they once said
echoing across infinity and back to me
Burning through all my nerve endings 
peeling back old layers of toxicity
Bending me with all their many questions
probing me until I vanish in a moment
A wisdom beyond the worlds comprehension
Guiding me home to a place Ill never live in
The answer on my very lips, drifting
right before I speak it I'm awakened
Reality reminds me of the hell I've created
and truth eludes me for yet another decade
But the feeling remains and my heart is patient
It knows what my mind can never quite get
I'm a machine and my buttons get pressed
My heart is tender but my soul is resilient
My thoughts go rancid, leaking like a faucet
tossing garbage and the garbage mans dead
taking over my body, like a cancer it spreads
until I collapse in a heap on my bed
Begging for sleep to hide me from this mess
Then I remembered a little voice said
Light up the world with what little you have 
The darkness craves to be contended with
You can rise up with all your strength
if you stop trying your fears to escape
But you are asleep even when you're awake
That vision you have you keep dreaming away...


This time when I slept I dreamt of turmoil
I experienced the pain of the entire world
all contained in this one body of mine
Someone asked me, Would you prefer to die? 
make it disappear in the blink of an eye?
but know this first before you choose -
that the entire world will die with you
I started speaking before I even knew


I'm strong because I know the weakness of darkness
for I was the dark and of that I was conscious
Exposure it feared, like a dream to eyes opened
running away from my undivided focus
To love it until its no longer pent up
opening floodgates before it self destructs
in flames it erupts so light can be found
An infinite fire that can never go out
burning in my heart and other ones around
who also feel things most don't talk about
So lets speak the words most wont dare to say
lets build an army and put on a brave face 
lets light up the world, lets give them a taste
Succulent flavors and heavenly seasonings
A decadent banquet with all the trimmings
A feast of hearts from all the courageous
Feeding the dark all the light we can give it
Until every soul is filled up to the brim
This is my calling, this is my mission
Looking to find those who feel the same thing
Those mad enough to want to make a difference
Even if you're just a boy or a girl
Let us go and light up the world

Hello, plain and simple, i'm looking for a woman who will dominate me. I'd love to find someone who will have me worship their ass, feet, body and whatever else they want me to do for however long they want. I can't do any penetration, I am new to any type of femdom so i am not comfortable with that... yet, i may be as time passes and my comfort level grows. Other than that, i am pretty much open to anything. I am 21 years old, 165 pounds, and fairly well muscled for my size. I have medium length hair and we'll trimmed facial hair. I will gladly shave for you if you wish. I look forward to servicing any woman who will have me. Unfortunately i cannot host any activities I may perform for you as I have 5 roommates and would not want them interfering with my duties. However i can travel most places in the east bay ranging from Concord to SF, pretty much anywhere Bart can reach, and will be eager to get to you if you will have me. I am new to this sort of stuff so it would be nice if someone was kind enough to help me get introduced to it. That is also why I am not posting any pictures of me, however, if you are serious about me servicing you I will send you some. Thank you for taking the time to read this, you are beautiful and a goddess. My number is

""Old"", wise, erudite, communicative guy whose heart's true desire is NOT ""strictly platonic"", but who knows better than to spend time looking for the near impossible, seeks stimulating wide ranging correspondence with a woman who'd enjoy the same.

No topical boundaries, no ideological rigmarole, no snooty attitude, and no lack of humor... just deep as well as light conversation about anything and everything under the sun and beyond... the more esoteric the better. It's an outlet, mental exercise, mutual education, a chance for contact in a world where contact of any kind is becoming more and more difficult and risky.

If you require anonymity that's fine -- although I don't. My objective is simply discourse, amusement, and stimulation. If anything more comes of it, it will be because we both agree that it's there to explore. This is not a ploy to find someone to date. You should share my lack of concern about age, appearance, location, relationship status, or any other physical details. I'm interested in a meeting of minds.

My life has many dimensions. I get plenty of physical and mental exercise, but it's typically solitary. This ad isn't likely to change that, but perhaps we'll feel a connection through ideas and words.

Be creative... be poetic... be sincere... be determined to express yourself freely.

Send me a note... I'll know from the word count whether we have potential.

cheers, blessings, peace, namaste, and whatever makes your life better!

This is for all fitness levels. I am VERY new to the world of running, I'm an ex-weightlifter who can't do that anymore so I thought I'd start this group. I also happen to be single, so why not combine the two.

We can meet once or twice a week, maybe more down the line. We can go running in hills, walking down Iron Horse Trail or even hiking. I'm hoping this takes off, and any ideas would be much appreciated.

I've been married long enough to know that I want to stay married and that I've got a pretty good thing. I've also been married long enough that we've become good roommates and stopped being lovers. I'd like a little more than a pretty good thing.
Maybe it's just wishful thinking, but I would love it if there were some woman out there who was in the same situation. Do you want to stay with your husband, but the sex is gone? Is your husband completely on autopilot and doesn't care? You don't want to leave, but you want more physically and/or emotionally?
I'm looking for someone to accept what I can provide and to provide what I desire. Physically, I miss kissing a woman. Not just kissing, but making out like a teenager. I'm very oral and would love to find a woman who also misses this. I miss kissing the mouth of a woman, feeling the warmth and softness of your lips, continuing down your neck and stomach, inhaling your scent, tasting the wetness between your thighs, and feeling you writhe and push yourself into my mouth.
I'm completely open on age and race. If you've been married long enough to be interested in my post, you probably no longer look like a Hollywood sex symbol. That's OK. You may have had a kid or gained a little weight. There isn't any such thing as perfection. I love real women's bodies, not airbrushed fantasies. Tall, short, slender, full-figured, younger, older, there's something I love about them all. I go to the gym a few times a week, but I don't live there. I've been told I'm good looking, but I don't expect to be on the cover of GQ any time soon.
As I say, maybe my desire is just wishful thinking and forever resigned to remain a fantasy. But if there are any women in the area who feel the same way, I'd love to hear from you. Given the discretion required by our situations, you don't have to send me a picture. Besides, I'd rather you tell me about yourself and what you miss.

If you read this far, why were you interested in my post? Please type ""BMW"" in your subject line, this will weed out all the spam.

I'm looking for a few more friends in the city. I have some good friends on the peninsula, but would like to have people with whom the planning can be a little more spur of the moment. 

I enjoy going out for coffee or happy hour, cooking and eating, and thrifting (both at places like Crossroads as well as Goodwill or Thrift Town). It would be great to find somebody who wanted to hike sometimes or take bike rides. Although I own a decent bike I'm not an especially skilled cyclist, I just enjoy it as a way of getting around and seeing things, but if there were someone who wanted to do longer rides, I could be into that. You don't have to ride a bike at all, though, that's just one idea. 

Anyway, I'm open to any fun activities, and I get along with a lot of different types of people. It's just nice to have someone to meet up with sometimes. Send me an email if you think we might get along and we can go get coffee or something!

Hi

I have this natural curiosity in people that seems to be insatiable. I crave learning all of the details about someone that make them who they are. My curiosity is usually focused on all the weird little quarks that make people unique...

Normally I would just head out into the world and try to meet new people, but I have a couple of things that are really hindering this. I'm usually super busy and I am partnered. This brings me to CL.

My schedule is very erratic, so I am hoping to find someone new (maybe you!) who would like to hang out at spontaneous times throughout the day. Maybe we grab lunch or coffee, or maybe just relax somewhere and talk. Ideally I would like there to be some attraction, and I would like to play with the idea of getting to know each other physically, but without crossing any extreme lines (remember Im partnered).

About you: Please be intelligent, interesting, fun, and open minded. Please also be somewhat close to my age range (22-44) Lately I am particularly interested in women of Asian decent, so bonus points if that's you. I am both generally attracted to them, and curious about cultural differences, but I am open to all races.

About me: I am just your tall dark and handsome type (JK). I'm intelligent, and fun loving. I'm both introverted and outgoing. Most people say that they have never met anyone like me before. Most women find me very attractive. I am tall, lean/muscular, with long dark hair and light eyes. I'm also white if that makes a difference to you.

I can't wait to hear from you!

Hi, I'm looking for hiking partners in the bay area. I'm open to meeting either men(I'm straight) or women. I'd do the ""meetup"" thing but they're just too crowded and very casual; having a real conversation/connection is nearly impossible.

My favorite hike's are in Mill Valley but anywhere in the north bay is great for hikes. Pacifica is also full of great hikes. The hike I find to be the most grueling is Mt Diablo, especially in the summer when it's hot out. My go-to hike is San Bruno Mt, and I can usually string those trails together for 10 miles.

As for me, I'm 35, fairly athletic, an ambivert(introvert/extrovert) if I'm going to put a label on myself; I'm friendly(people actually tell me this) and outgoing, but enjoy the peace and calm of nature. I'm a great listener, great at communication, into psychology, and the human condition. I'm well traveled and can converse with pretty much anyone who speaks my language.

My best friends are married with children so they aren't available as much as I'd like them to be, and I broke up with my girlfriend 6 months ago so I'm still figuring out how to occupy that time she filled. Not heartbroken if that's what you're thinking. Let me know if you'd like to meet, thanks

Are you a married woman feeling neglected at home? Feeling like an object? No excitement at all. Living your marriage as a roommate situation? Do you miss being asked how are you feeling? Maybe you have kids and that's the reason why you need to stay married and yet miss the attention of someone. Some one who wants to know what you're thinking, some one who will send you a random message just to let you know they are thinking about you. Someone who might be willing to sneak out of work to go and have a cup of coffee or lunch from time to time. 

I am looking for a non-traditional relationship. I am looking for a special friendship with a married woman with whom we can take the time to actually get to know each other. We could talk about an infinite amount of topics ranging from the ones that are very important to you to those who are just trivial and for sure a bit flirty. I am a safe, clean, married guy . My goal is for us to become special friends and we can define that meaning as time goes on. 

im very easy going, fit, I've been told I'm not bad looking but if you ask me I'm just an average guy. 

You: please be between 36 to 48years old. Give or take a couple of years.. I'm in my early 40s but I've been told I look as if I was in my 30s
This is not purely physical, I'm looking more for chemistry and compatibility.

Hey there! I am looking for new friends and/or walking buddies in the Santa Teresa neighborhood (or close to it -- Los Huecos Drive at Chesbro Avenue). On weekdays I get home from work between 1600 and 1700. On weekends I'm either playing softball or going on adventures with my roommates. I am close with my roommates, but they don't get home until after 2100 on weekdays. I have to get up at 0400 and therefore I am in bed long before they get home. In consequence I spend most weekday afternoons on my own and I would like to make new friends in my area to hang out with during that time (M-F, 1600-2000). I also need to start losing weight and I am going to start by walking around my neighborhood when I get home from work; at least 30 minutes a day. I would love to have company on such walks; have someone to talk to about my day and vice versa. If you are interested or have any questions, please feel free to shoot me an email. Thanks and have a great day!

I am well versed with yoni massage and tantric massage and can make you cum with my massage and also using my talented tongue that knows it way around the pussy to make you cum nice and good!!!

Hey there!

Are you also involved with someone, who at one time may have been exciting but no longer is? Not just sexually (though that may be a big deal for you), but emotionally? Have you drifted apart, yet stay together for your own reasons? Would you like to commiserate sometime over coffee?

But seriously, I'm a handsome (maybe I'm bias), tall, average-built, also involved, 40-something, looking for a similar ""ear"" to share stories and even closely guarded secrets. I'm witty, intelligent, very cordial and considerate, love probing questions, and enjoy deep conversations - especially the most controversial subjects (with the most intellectually stimulating woman).

This isn't about sex (unless of course we absolutely have to) since intimacy is a very interesting thing and can only truly be enjoyed when an emotional connection is made. At least that's how I feel. Let's just leave that part out for now and see what happens.

PS ... I won't hold you responsible for not liking me, physically or otherwise, especially after the critical picture swap. And please don't pretend to if you don't. We are complex creatures and like what we like. The end. :)

Did I lose you yet? If not, I am 100% real and serious. You should be, too. And bots/prostitutes: DO NOT ask me to ""verify"" myself on your ""free"" site. I've not raped or killed anyone, nor have I thought about raping or killing anyone - ever, ha!, but thank you for your efforts. You should put your sales skills to better use. Think of the possibilities . . . :)

I'll be waiting,

I have gone my whole life without a female friend. sure, i have the occasional female friend i talk to every once in a while that i went to college with, but none that i talk to on a regular basis. i've always been a guys guy, sports, the constant bs-ing with each other, you know, the crap that guys do when they're together. i always enjoy the company of females and their perspective on life. so why not start now and try to become friends.

you're more simple than complex
aren't too into material things
can laugh
can talk
can cry


i'm from the midwest. i'm almost 6 feet tall. basketball is my favorite sport to watch, golf my favorite to play. i'm very random, will say the most random things and am pretty outgoing. or i can just be chill. it all depends on the situation. i like hiking a lot too. or just sitting and talking....or listening because i know that the majority of females like to talk. 
so if any females out there find this appealing and want a good guy friend, hit me back and we can start chatting!

i am not an only child
my favorite color is green
i am ambidextrous
i've been to more of the united states than probably everyone you know

Good morning! First off thanks for readi my post 

I'm seeking to develop a long term friendship with one person. Someone I can trust, laugh with, and have great conversations. Seeking someone who can be a confidant. Talk about anything and everything. Share frustrations about daily life whether it be work or family. Be silly, escape from everyday routine life. Be ourselves and not what we need to be for everyone else. Share secrets thoughts dreams fantasies what ever. Have fun. Add some excitement to our lives. Not looking to change status or cause drama. I'm happy for the most part on my marriage just feel like a few things missing. Me : sincere witty funny smart ass sarcastic sense of humor. Latino light skinned clean cut look. If any of this resonates or can relate. Well you've read this far. So why not throw caution into the wind so to speak and start s fun exciting friendship with me : )

I do like to bike. My main workout is pull-ups and the occasionally push-ups. Once in a while, I'll juggle 5-lb tone balls. I could play ping-pong for hours until my arms gets tired.

So any woman(butch, stud, straight, etc) in their 20s-40s want to introduce me to an exhaustive sport.
(I guess dancing is consider a sport). 
I could settle for a pong partner. I'm just starting table tennis club play and probably (ITTF 250).

I'm straight and don't smoke. Drink occasionally.

BTW, you don't need to disclose your sexual preference. Mysteries are more interesting.

I could meet in the City or around Berkeley.

Issues discussed in the group include clarifying one's life goals; relationships with friends, family, and partners; finding meaning and connection; and the many other challenges of aging. The age range of the current group members is broad, from the late 50s through the 70s. The group meets every Thursday evening from 7:00 to 8:30 pm, in my office on Clement Street. There is a monthly fee.

My friend bought me a ticket to see Glassjaw and Coheed & Cambria next Wednesday as a birthday gift and I'm planning on going alone. If you're also going alone, maybe we can partner up and keep each other company between sets/tell jokes. I don't smoke weed, so you don't have to worry about me bumming your pot. We can meet in San Fran before the show. 
I'M NOT DRIVING. I'M TAKING GREYHOUND. So if you're looking for a ride, I'm not the person.

I find cooking for one to be difficult. Many days I plan on cooking when I get home, but when I actually get home, I just throw something easy together. It's not cooking and it's not the most healthful way to go. I wonder if there is someone in Petaluma, where I live, that might want to be a cooking buddy. We could give each other a reason to actually cook dinner. Ideally you are a woman, but if you're a man and this sounds like something to explore, by all means, let's see if we are compatible. around 6-6:30.

Hey local diaper dwellers! I'm an Adult Baby that recently moved to the Peninsula area feeling really lonely. I migrated here due to job relation as a graphic designer. Considering that I'm relatively new to this side of the bay, I wanted to establish some new friendships--with other ABDL's of all genders, who share my interest in Age Play and Regression. We can meet at a coffee shop or some public venue initially, and see what develops. My goal is to start a new chapter, with a new circle of friends who can relate to this obscure lifestyle.

Hello! I just moved here with my boyfriend for his job about three months ago. I work from home and I haven't really had the chance to click with many people in the Martinez area :) I would love to meet you if you think we'd get along! Male or female, doesn't matter. Coupled up or not, doesn't matter either. 21+ please for age but don't really have an upper age limit if we have a lot in common. I seem to get along with people in their 50s often for some reason. I have a strong preference for someone close to me so that travel is not an issue (I bike/walk most places); I'm in Martinez. I have a very flexible schedule so it'd be especially great if you could do things during the day but not a big deal if you can't.

Things I think are fun: 
*Board games! Would love a regular group to do this with. 
*Hiking
*Running (although I'm pretty slow), Walking, whatever, I am open to new exercise activities, I think soon I will start a martial art class. If there is something you like I will likely be willing to try it. I have a free weights set if you wanna lift together.
*I like to cook vegan/vegetarian foods (I make a bomb homemade pizza)
*Watching NFL Games (Go Broncos! but I MIGHT be converted to slotting another team into the #2 slot)
*Hanging out at the Waterfront with coffee
*Cue & Brew coin pool
*Trivia nights
*Netflix binges
*Mystery Shopping

I'm not big on spending a lot of money so I don't tend to go to restaurants, bars, salons, that sort of thing very often at all. If there's something you are passionate about I am open to learning about it.

I guess that's a good start! If that sounds good let me know!

I am a desi working male in south bay....

I am looking for a very specific indian lady for friendship. If you are bored from your daily grind and mundane working life and need a new desi male for good conversation and friendship with new experiences and a different twist, I would be the person you would be friends with.

If you are looking for a friendship, which is based on ""barter"" system, then please consider me. I would be very much willing to get you a dress or two from a store (if you are running short of chash), or get you lingerie or panties/bra from Victoria Secret or similar store. You are willing to consider a fun friendship. 

What am I seeking? Well, not exactly what you think, but close to.

How about trading cooking recipes with me? How about cooking me a sample of any famous or favorite dish that you are good at cooking? May be I can learn few things. I am reasonably good at cooking, but always looking for new cuisine. May be Indian, may be non-Indian. can you barter this kind of trade with me? If you want to make it slightly more fun, then you might consider some non-sexual kind of fun too!

See thing is, I'm attached and will need to stay alone for few months while spouse is out of country and looking for a very fun way to get to know a new woman and make friends with!

We can talk about different bartering scenarios if you wish.
After all the ""Benefit"" in ""Friends with benefit"" always comes with some kind of trade offs.

Hence, clothes for cooking, or clothes for mild-fun, or clothes for some other kind of benefit, would be good!

Or how about clothes for massage?
Or cooking for massage?
(I give great full body massage!)....

I'm a handsome desi man, good looking, fit and trim, in good shape and take good care of myself!

Hi!
I am looking to restart my healing practice - to that end I would like to find some other like-minded person or persons to exchange healing/bodywork. If we click I see this work as an ongoing thing extending over 2 or 3 months or more. Some of the areas I have worked and trained in are: Chi Nei Tsang massage, Chi-kung, Reiki, Conscious Breathing/rebirthing, and Cranialsacral therapy. I have done years of support groups, classes and seminars in these healing modalities and others. I also recently completed one and a half years of service and retreat at Vajrapani Institute near Santa Cruz. 
I currently live and work in Napa, CA. I am 61 years old, male, committed to a spiritual path. Integrity, honesty, compassion, service, sense of humor are a few words to give you an idea of how I'd like to approach working with others in the healing field. If this sounds good to you I'd love hear back and see if we might be a fit.

I didn't know where to post this because we are looking for something different, as you will see. 

We are two bicycle riders from the East Bay who plan on riding across the USA, from Santa Monica to St. Petersburg, Florida, starting in June 2016 and ending mid to late August. 

We are looking for a driver for a support vehicle and the driver can bring a friend for company/as a chaperone. We will pay all expenses for both of you, including air fare, lodging and food during the trip. 

We will drive to Los Angeles where we can stay for a couple of days to sight see if you would like (I have a large condo there). We then start our ride toward Palm Springs and on to the Grand Canyon (a wonder of the world and photos really do not do it justice). From there we will travel through such places as Flagstaff and Sedona, Arizona, Albuquerque, New Mexico (with its Native American culture), Santa Fe (one of the art capitals of the world), Carlsbad Caverns, Austin (probably the most progressive city in Texas), San Antonio (home of the Alamo and its river walk which doesn't rival Venice but is nonetheless fun), Baton Rouge, New Orleans (home of Cajun cooking and Mardi Gras) and finally St. Augustine (the oldest continuously occupied European settlement in the US). We will spend rest and visiting days in the more interesting places so it won't be just a ""drive by"" experience.

There will be boring stretches of vast expanses, but more importantly, you will have the chance to see more small town ""Americana"" than most Americans get to see while experiencing Tex-Mex food, parts of the ""Old West,"" Louisiana, Florida and much more. We will take a different route driving back across the country to see different places, probably including Las Vegas. 

Because the two of us will be riding our bikes going to Florida, your driving will only be from 50 miles to at most 115 miles per day, with some days off for our rest and to visit places of interest. We would like you to do laundry once a week or so while we are riding as well as some food shopping and preparation (lunches, such as sandwiches) and help with planning our lodging and stops.

You need to be good natured, responsible, easy to get along with, be drug free and, of course, have a valid driver's license with no major violations. This is perfect for a college student, a recent graduate who doesn't yet have a job or possibly a teacher who wants to spend vacation time exploring.

In the photo with the view in the background, I am 2nd from the right and Nick is 4th from the right. In the photo in front of a building, Nick is 3rd from the right (in the yellow) and I am immediately to his right, with the ""Garneau"" top. On the bikes, Nick is in the middle, I am on the left.

We are 2 responsible professional men who live in the East Bay (Nick in Pleasant Hill, me in Orinda). I don't know that it is relevant, but Nick is single and I am in a ltr. 

Let us know if you are interested.

Thank you, and here is to the adventure of a life time,

Rick

So I could totally go to a bar and I could go up and talk to people, but they just become the 1 night friend you know? After that you never hear from them. Sure you can meet people who stick with you, but I have yet to see that. Anyways, I'm simply looking for a kind of woman who loves to go out, who would love to go out the pier, the beach, downtown, a bar, or wherever we go and simply have a good time and chat about what revolves around our life and everything else. Just because I'm a guy doesn't always have to mean that I'm just looking to hook up. I'm simply looking for a woman to call my friend right now, and to ask her out for a fun night, that's it. I like to text, but really I'm all about meeting up for a coffee and talk in person, like it should be anyways. A little about me would be that my name is Alexander, I'm 21, I have a job as a lyft driver, I'm single, I'm Hispanic, and the rest we could talk about it in person haha. The only thing I ask from you is that you're at least above drinking age and single, I'm really not up for drama. Hope to hear from you!

You and I are both a little lonely. I know, its hard to swallow but truth is we have trouble connecting day to day. I'm not insulting or judging, just trying to have a different and honest interaction. I feel vulnerable admitting it, but I know if someone reaches out, they will be genuine, and something like that is nice. We both have that knowledge of one another. I'm not desperate and I'm not searching for 'the one'. I have a good life which lacks that inescapable something.

I love words and the positive impact they can have on our minds. I don't have ANY hidden agendas and I won't judge you and only ask the same in return...this is simply a way for me to escape for a little while. I'd prefer to converse with someone my own age, mostly due to the amount of pop culture references I will likely be sprinkling into our correspondence. We don't have to write every day. I'm not always available and I'm not expecting you to be either.

As an aside: We're trying to put forth the very best qualities (both personality-wise and physical appearance) of ourselves or perhaps trying to shine up those we think will appeal to others. Trying to conform to some un-achievable archetype that doesn't really exist. We all have flaws and quirks that make us unique - and I think we should embrace and own them. Yes?

While meeting in person is not always plausible, it doesn't preclude us from sharing a photo or two for curiosities sake - but we don't have to do that either. Sometimes the mystery is the best part.

Read this somewhere and found it so appropriate:

I don't know why I chose this road
as blind success turns to folly 
as doubt and fear become commonplace 
the stout hearted become circumspect
the truth of lies so freely told;
we friends are made of liars and cheats 
no safety in the hearts of friends
no truth from lips so stained with tears.

A little about myself. I'm a 21 year old professional who moved here last July for work. I used to do gymnastics in college, but I've noticed the lazy adult life has taken a big toll on my flexibility. That's why I'm on a stretching rampage as of late.

Hey there!

Are you also involved with someone, who at one time may have been exciting but no longer is? Not just sexually (though that may be a big deal for you), but emotionally? Have you drifted apart, yet stay together for your own reasons? Would you like to commiserate sometime over coffee?

But seriously, I'm a handsome (maybe I'm bias), tall, average-built, also involved, 40-something, looking for a similar ""ear"" to share stories and even closely guarded secrets. I'm witty, intelligent, very cordial and considerate, love probing questions, and enjoy deep conversations - especially the most controversial subjects (with the most intellectually stimulating woman).

This isn't about sex (unless of course we absolutely have to) since intimacy is a very interesting thing and can only truly be enjoyed when an emotional connection is made. At least that's how I feel. Let's just leave that part out for now and see what happens.

Hey there!

Are you also involved with someone, who at one time may have been exciting but no longer is? Not just sexually (though that may be a big deal for you), but emotionally? Have you drifted apart, yet stay together for your own reasons? Would you like to commiserate sometime over coffee?

But seriously, I'm a handsome (maybe I'm bias), tall, average-built, also involved, 40-something, looking for a similar ""ear"" to share stories and even secrets with. I'm witty, intelligent, very cordial and considerate, love probing questions, and enjoy deep conversations -- especially the most controversial subjects.

This isn't about sex (unless of course we absolutely have to) since intimacy is a very interesting thing and can only truly be enjoyed when an emotional connection is made. At least that's how I feel. Let's just leave that part out for now and see what happens . . .

PS ... I won't hold you responsible for not liking me, physically or otherwise, especially after the critical picture swap. We are complex creatures and like what we like. The end. :)

I know the title sounds dramatic, but the reality is that while I'm mostly healed from my childhood sexual and physical abuse emotionally, yet I'm still at a point where I find it very hard to be intimate and connect with women in a dating context. I've had 3 short relationships in the past 10 years and been alone the rest of the time. When single, I don't date casually or ""hook up"", which means I go long periods of time without any kind of physical contact and comfort. Lately I'm really missing the emotional support it provides and because of how busy I am with some new work endeavors, I have no time to date. So if I could find a kind, generous girl to be a good friend and non-sexual cuddle buddy it would really give me something I've been sorely lacking and missing and would provide emotional/physical support as pursue my new career goals. Also, please don't judge this, but I would prefer an Asian or Indian woman simply because I've spent a lot of time in that part of the world and feel more at peace there and thus I've found a greater ability to detach from the normal associations of my past abuse in intimate/physical contact with Asian/Indian women.

Lakes, mountains, oceans, stars, and more lakes and mountains! My name is Gene, and I am 56 years old. I have a little dog named Buddy, of which I am a single parent. I don't want to be. I don't know how this might work out, but I want to relocate from California to Colorado to Woodland Park near Colorado Springs to be involved with the Charis Bible College people. I don't exactly have a lot of clean and sober days racked up, but I am getting much closer. I am hard on myself though because I think i am doing wrong to take my seizure meds ( I haven't had a seizure in a long time). I am into the revolution of Grace as shared by Pastor Joseph Prince, but moving to Singapore, would be nice, but complicated. Woodland Park Colorado is a spiritual greenhouse. Thanks for reading this, and email me back if any of this makes good sense. I want to enjoy God's creation before its too late, but not alone or just me and Buddy. Sincerely, Gene

By going on this site you are brave, I guess, we both are. I thought a long time about it but I realized that in life you should live it to the fullest possible with no regrets. What do you think? I am a discreet, married, white male, athletic build, professional, with a sense of humor and adventure. Of course why else would I be doing this? lol!. I am happy with my life, but maybe too greedy...want a bit more from what life has been able to give...explorative conversation and what a new person can bring out in me and in themselves as well. I know that what you can't get from this profile is to anticipate how two people might interact together once they make contact -- that is more about ""chemistry"", don't you think? You have to spark that with someone, get to know them, feel a sense of connection. Our communication may be no more than email conversation, but then again it could lead to something more. I am not looking for a lot of people roaming through my life and you probably aren't either, we are busy in life and need to be selective and discerning. So a journey starts with the first step. . .this is mine. . .will you take the first step with me??

I am fortunate enough to be able to take time off from my career now and be able to explore/develop the ""non-career"" part of me. Unfortunately, most of my friends are still working, so I have plenty of time during the workday to do things (and get into mischief)! 

I am looking for (an) activity partner(s) to do things with during the weekday - maybe a hike, have coffee, lunch, take a short drive to the coast, wineries (if they are open during weekdays), golf, run, chat, etc. Pretty much open to possibilities - I guess ultimately, make (a) friend(s) along the way!

A little bit about myself - late 40's, reasonably but not ""run a marathon"" fit, interested in diverse cultures, multilingual, likes trying out new foods, socially & technically aware, a little on the ""nerdy/geekish"" side, an introvert that has learned to be an extrovert when needed, finding me reading a book with a glass of good wine is a lot more likely than finding me drinking at a club or party! Oh, by the way, an Asian who does not smoke (cigs or otherwise), if that matters! 

Thanks for reading thus far! If you think you would like to make a new friend, shoot me an email with some description of yourself - who knows if we will click or not, but it will be ""not"" if we don't take the first step!

Cheers!

I only want to be submissive, sex is not needed, though sensuality, eroticism, nudity is.

You do not need experience, just the desire to dominate and control. I can consider providing some compensation for your time if we get together, but not looking for the boring loser skank pro's.

I can host in my private, beautiful, safe, comfortable home in the City.

You must be serious which means we will need to exchange phone numbers - no time-wasting emails. If you are the typical c/l flake, teeny bopper playing online, keep looking, i don't want to waste time with socially dysfunctional children. We will need to exchange phone numbers, and direct email addresses (not filtered thru cl).

So. What's the deal with this post then? The deal is there is something about stockings that is just completely delicious to me. I'm not talking about pantyhose or tights. I'm talking about thigh high stockings (with or without garter straps).

But having spent some time here I realize that this post is a total shot in the dark. The only time I see posts about lingerie like this it's dudes looking for women or other guys who are into it.

Sooooooooo... My goal here is to find a woman that is into this sort of lingerie too. A woman that is willing to share her thoughts. Baring that a woman that is curious as to why us men are so into lingerie ;)

This is NOT about meeting someone, or even an ""in"" to get, um, in your pants. I am single but just want to babble online.

Wish me luck. I'm going to need it!

Seekin someone in the same boat or similar situation. Someone who is interested in developing a long term friendship and wanting a confidant to share with. Married for over 15 yrs with kids.

Would like to enjoy emailing someone on a daily basis. Share thoughts laughter confide in frustrations that we can't really talk to with friends and family. Help escape from everyday life and throw caution to the wind. Let our hair down so to speak. Make a good friend.

Do you enjoy photography?
Do you love helping others?
Do you love San Francisco?
A plus if you own a DSLR camera!?

I'm desperately seeking employment and I have an idea on how to publish myself in different social medias to land that job. BUT I need a photographer to take photos of me at different tourist locations throughout San Francisco. We would probably need 2 full days (Saturday, Sunday). I'm very low on funds, but I can pay for lunch.

I've received many responses from males, I appreciate that, but I I feel more comfortable interacting with a woman on this project.

I would be forever grateful if you're out there and are willing to help me!

It would be best if she likes all things that have to do with all of the things that have nothing to do with anything. The best fit would be someone who takes the same drug I take, and understands that sometimes people just need a friend. A guy friend simply will not do, as I am

Hi - thanks for stopping by! 

So, I've wanted to try this for a while but have been very hesitant and feel funny about it. I basically want to explore what it's like to be painted/drawn by a FEMALE while in the nude. I'm not looking for anything sexual, just wanting to try this experience I've been thinking about. 

This might not sound like a big deal to a lot of people, but it kind of is to me. I don't have much experience with nude art... And my experience being nude in front of people is basically nil (with the exception of being in the gym showers). So, I'd really like to explore this with an artist who would also enjoy it. We would have to be very comfortable - developing a trusting friendship. I'm not sure what I'll feel when I 'drop the robe' so to speak... it could be embarrassment or shame. I might feel aroused. I might just feel indifferent. So I'd like to find someone who will make this a comfortable and fun experience. 

I'll be happy to buy dinner and drinks... I just need you to supply the artist's skill set :)

Again, I'm a SWM, athletically built, and clean-cut looking... pretty normal overall (except for this desire to be painted/drawn completely naked).

I'm looking to make friends with a woman who tends towards being dominant in life, relationships, career. An intelligent, fun, powerful woman. Maybe a tomboy, into sports, or just a straight up boss!
You have that mom sensibility, responsible, yet stern.

Age, race, orientation doesn't matter.

I'm a friendly, educated guy in his early 30s, just looking to make friends. I tend to be more on the passive/submissive side of life- often that ends up leading to me getting stepped all over, which I'm trying to work on. I just prefer strong women, someone I can chat with, give and get honest advice from, share stories, etc.

I can trade pics if you'd like. Looking to chat a little first before deciding if meeting up would be fun.

Hey there diaper dwellers! I'm an Adult Baby that recently moved to the Peninsula area feeling really lonely. I migrated here due to job relation as a graphic designer. Considering that I'm relatively new to this side of the bay, I wanted to establish some new friendships--with other ABDL's of all genders, who share my interest in Age Play and Regression. We can meet at a coffee shop or some public venue initially, and see what develops. My goal is to start a new chapter, with a new circle of friends who can relate to this obscure lifestyle. A huge plus if you're into video games, music, animation, or anything that pertains to geek culture.

Looking for someone fun and engaging to either text, email, talk or meet with...you choose what you're comfortable with.

I just need to expand my circle of friends and get some new singles in my life.

I'm a laid back, easy going guy looking for the same thing in a girl. No expectations...friends first and if something happens, fine..if not, that's okay too.

Let's keep it in the 25-35 range if at all possible and take it from there.

So if you want a cool guy friend in your circle, put your favorite drink/cocktail in the subject line and let's start this conversation!

This man would probably connect best with a woman between 35 and 55. Somewhat flexible though on age. He would like to talk to a woman who needs a man that will truly listen. Not act or pretend to listen, but really be fully present with her. He is not a counselor and will not analyze her.This is a man, though, that wants to show that he cares. This man is comfortable with himself. This man will love to laugh. Nothing beats a good laugh sometimes! He knows how to break the tension. He will not have expectations, but he is willing to email of course or is open to texting, talking on the phone or meeting up. Maybe she wants him to be the one to talk. If she wants to listen more, or let him share what's going on with him, he will be more than happy to open up. This man knows he has a lot to offer, so he doesn't have an agenda. This man is compassionate, intuitive, open minded, self-aware, savvy, perceptive, and smart. It's not difficult for him to show that he can be fun and has a playful side. This man is single with no kids. This man is open to either chatting casually, friendship or dating or some level of relationship. This man does not have an agenda. This man truly seeks a connection with a woman. Does this sound like a man you might also connect well with? If these words speak to you, he hopes to hear from you soon!

I've been exploring CA for years. I've been to Death Valley eleven times and I especially, love deserts and wide open spaces.

I'm a very youthful retired late middle-aged woman (I have many friends in their 30s and 40s). Road trips for me include easy hiking and exploring local towns' thrift stores and shops. I'm quite flexible about duration of trips. My biggest problem in retirement has been finding women who have the time, money and desire to hit the road without much of an agenda. 

I have a wide range of interests and am generally conceded to be very funny. I don't get my knickers in a twist over much. I'm a writer and big reader so I take my laptop and write when there's downtime.

You must be able to pull your own weight and share expenses such as gas and lodging. 

Spontaneity and a sense of humor and curiosity are absolutely essential. 

The point of road trips is to take a break from daily life so please be able to disconnect from electronica except for basic checking in with relatives and such. I don't want to find myself staring at the top of your head as you text and photograph your food.

Let's talk and meet and see if we're on the same page. The days are getting longer and I'll soon be rarin' to go. I have a brand new Kia Rio and a GPS. It's easier if you're in or near San Francisco, but not essential.

I'm not averse to tent camping, and still have my equipment.

I'm in my fifties, clean-cut white collar professional type, fit and height-weight proportionate, non-smoker, intelligent, educated, fun, funny, respectful, laid-back, passionate. I'm married (wife hasn't been into this for years, alas) so discretion is important. If you are a woman in your twenties to early fifties and this appeals to me, email me back with your description and what you like about this idea! I would prefer someone fairly close, who is able to meet during the work day or right after work. Oh, and please put your city in the subject line so I know you're not a spambot. Thanks.

Hello Craigslist,
I have been fascinated by Korean music and Korean dramas for some time now. I have tried to learn Korean on my own, but it is going very slowly. If you know Korean, or are studying it yourself, and want to fan boy out to K-Pop and Korean drama together while we/I learn, let me know! Who knows, something could spark from it at as well.

I bet we both are....

And yes, we are and should both married or attached...but in need and search of more since we cant really change our current situations.... I guess we have already this in common if you are still reading this ad.

I'm not alone I bet... Life is way too short to keep losing time as we are getting older everyday...

I am hoping to find a nice and sincere woman... a wise woman...attractive too...I'm mostly attracted to light complexure women....

I workout regularly and take care of myself... So I'm hoping to find a gal that likes similar things that is in good shape and takes care of herself!

We can find ourselves in situations that seemingly have no end. My wife has become more of a roommate than anything else. Circumstances that I will not go into here prevent me from leaving. Been together for a long time and now we just pass each other in the night. There are stupid arguments, stupid fights, no ugly but dormant. It's impossible to talk. Who would understand? Who would even believe? After all, we're are perceived as always been happy....We are what everyone envision as the 'perfect' marriage.

I am looking for a confident,friends with benefits, or anything with passion. I want companionship, friendship, communication, mutual respect, trust and caring. I'm looking for someone, preferably married, who may be in a similar situation and looking for a little something more in their life. Let's be each others friend, companion, confidant and possibly lovers if it goes that far. Communication is key with me. I like to exchange cute emails and chats during the day. It's simply a lot of fun because I'm a also romantic at heart.

I'm not looking to be your new husband nor am I looking for you to be my new wife. When we can, we'll steal moments away with each other.

I'm an educated hard working professional, funny, discreet, humorous, caring, polite, respectful, laid back person that knows how to treat a lady as a lady. I'm a romantic and caring person. I like to engage in funny give and take conversations with a bit of humorous bantering. I'm a passionate person who is missing much of that now in my life. I would like to meet and be with a special friend on many levels; intellectually, compassionately, as good friends that share and confide in each other and also passionately. I'm a good listener and very sensitive to the moods and needs of those close to me. Affectionate and caring. I keep my self in decent shape. If everything works out fine it will blossom into a nice romance.

Please put the "" city that you live in"" in subject replies so I know you have read me...

Hello,

Single, Black, , 40-years young, plus-size (/fat/BBW/thick/curvy/zaftig/rubenesque, etc. Whatever they're calling it this week. Feel free to enter your own nomenclature here) woman seeking platonic male friend.

An off the cuff list to describe me: quirky, cool, liberal, laid back, intelligent, engaging, fiery, fun, sociable, sophisticated sassy, creative, classy and kind.

I miss having an engaging, intelligent, enjoyable male to hit the town explore and have fun with. I'll be creating a list of adventures I'd like to enjoy this year: movies, festivals, concerts, cocktails, dinners, plays, scotch tasting, the casino, camping, vineyard wine tasting, comedy club, volunteering. Play golf? Show me how. Play poker? Teach me the tricks.

We can wing one another. I'll teach you the secrets of seducing a lady. I'll wing woman you at a local dive bar. Heck, I'll even accompany and help you get into Twist. Whatever floats our boat.

Need a Clyde to my Bonnie. Interested? Send a message.

No bank robbing, though. Promise.

So tired of flakey people who don't follow through with plans. I just want a friend to spend time with, doing fun things together but also supporting each other through rough times. Lately I feel like nothing is going right, everything is going wrong, and I have no one to talk to because the people I thought were my friends are nowhere to be found. I'd give anything just to have someone to talk to right now. I enjoy all kinds of different activities but I get so tired of having to do everything alone. I'm an introvert and I don't feel comfortable in large groups. I just need one friend that I can count on. We'll get together maybe twice a week, and the rest of the time we can communicate by text.

So I know most guys are only interested in sex, so if you are one of them you don't need to respond. I am not looking for sex, or sexual touches, or sexual anything. I am interested in cuddling, just cuddling. I like to cuddle after a hard day at work, on rainy days, cuddle and watch movies, cuddle and talk, cuddle on the beach. I just like to cuddle. There is something very relaxing and therapeutic about being held that as a single girl I miss. 

So a little about me: Im 25, half black half white, think zebra but less cool. I work in San Jose as a teacher but live in Capitola. I'm single and just in case you think you can turn the cuddling into something more, just know that I am looking for the one, with marriage and traveling, and kids within 5 years. So if you are ready for all of that then I might give you a shot, but only the one is getting in my pants, and even he will have to work for it. 

About you: You also enjoy cuddling and are hygienic!!!! This is important, you must smell good! Sorry, no smokers. You like watching movies and talking. You should also be fairly sane, and preferably not a murderer. And also willing to meet up for coffee or drinks or something so that I can determine if you are sane and not a murderer. 

I think thats about it. Reply if your interested. Oh, send a pic and I'll send mine, no nudes.

I'm looking for a woman that is interested in, has the time and desire, and is receptive to a friendship. If you are intelligent, very attractive, in excellent physical shape, educated, mentally and emotionally stable, good sense of humor, in or very close to SF, and over 40, between about 5'1"" - 5'5"", then you may be what I am seeking.

I have all the toys but am presently missing someone to share them with!

Looking for some or possibly many of the following qualities: friend, dining partner, entertainment friend, muse, part-time office assistant, and/or confidant. I am also not opposed to a LTR if the chemistry is right.

Serious only need apply. I'm a serious, genuine and for real SWM living in San Francisco; intelligent, very successful & wealthy, good personality and sense of humor, good shape, beautiful home, known art collector, stable, considerate, Jewish (non-practicing though), mature.

I do not send out photos nor waste time with back and forth email, but will speak with you to discuss details on the phone.

Don't respond in your heading what I've listed for my heading, a sure sign of spam. And tell me about yourself with specifics, not the standard spam patter. Also, be available, able to talk, and if it gets there, able to come to San Francisco on a regular basis.

Very Shy guy here looking for someone to hang out with or just chat with from time to time.
About myself, I'm a kid at heart. Very shy and reserved, loving, smart, funny, compassionate, and very nerdy at times. I'm looking for someone who likes those characters in a guy. Or at least doesn't mine them. 
I enjoy movies, video game, music, walking, art, drawing, and computers. I like to take long walks, I enjoy listening to the rain. 
I'm looking for someone who would like to just relax and hang out together. Talk, and simply have a good time. Someone kind and caring, not too controlling, and neat about themselves.

Hello craigslist ladies! 

Is it just me or is it really hard to make friends in this city? 

I've had the worst luck with friends here, and after finally having a solid small group of close friends they all moved away last year! And not like close far away mainly across the country and out of the country :/ It's a bummer because I am not someone who makes best friends overnight, I take my time to warm up then become loyal for life...just ask my cat haha 



I love traveling, love the desert and having adventures big or small, love photography and animals and having some drinks and hiking (those two things can be separate though! Haha) 

I'm not picky about being into the same music or style, what's important to me is someone that is just overall a good person, similar sense of humor and truly just wants a friendship! Also around my age would be cool too 



So here I am! :) Cheers!

Hi CL!
I'm a bored college student wanting to get out of my dorm, even in the rain. I really want to see a movie today, maybe Zootopia? I love animated movies like that. Maybe we grab a bite to eat after?

Not looking for anything other than catching a movie and hopefully making a new friend! I always need more. I'm 420 friendly if that matters at all! Hope to see you later today :) 

Send me an email and we'll figure it out! Down to snapchat too just so we don't wander aimlessly and walk up to random people trying to figure out who's who!

Oh and age doesn't really matter to me.

Hi, 

I'm looking for someone who would enjoy going on hikes, or walks on weekends. I live in San Bruno but I like to explore the city and surrounding areas. Some of my favorites are:

-Stow lake in GG park (they also have roller disco on weekends nearby there! I have yet to learn to roller blade)
-Pacifica, the pier and Mori Point
-Mission peak (I haven't been in a long while)
-Thorton State Beach
-Ocean beach and lands end
-Sawyer Camp Trail
-Fort Funston

you get the idea...

I would prefer someone around my age 39, but I'm open. 

We can exchange pics if that matters and if we hit it off even better. 
I am just looking for a walking buddy at this point, and preferably a female because I
have questions ;P 
Being able to converse about a wide range or topics would be ideal and preferred as well. 

I'm easy going, and patient and hope you are too. 

Hope to hear from someone!

Thanks

Hello, I'm a woman in my 30s who collects barbie dolls and similar sized friends, and I'm looking to connect with other doll collectors in my area. 

It would be fun to share the hobby with someone else who appreciates it. Ideally we could get together a group. 

Also if you just want to hang and ""play barbies"" that is cool too, and/or take photos/make videos for various media (tumblr, instagram, youtube, etc).

Basically just fun with dolls with friends. Contact me if you're interested. This is posted in women but anyone is welcome.

Hi, I am an 27 Asian female artist. I am creative, and witty and very attractive, also I am kind of corky. I know I am confident but I recently got out of a long term relationship and which made me realized I don't have any friends or at least the ones that I could take risks with or know how to give dating advice. 

So far my current best friend isn't much of a wing-woman or the adventurous type and she is also settle in as well.

I want to meet a new BFF that I could exchange fashion tips and dating advice and also have a good time with me as well. We could go shopping, dancing or just somethings creative. I am looking a partner in crime.

If you are interested please sent me a massage and a quick description of yourself. A photo will be a plus as well.

Ill be honest with you. Im litterally a steal, why Im resorting to craigslist, I havent the slightest clue.
Very moraly sound. Very hard working. Drink on occasion, smoke the gonja almost never (but weed smokers dont bother me none,) smoke cigarettes even less. Arguably the greatest sense of humor. Extensively trained in the art of cuddling via big fluffy dog. Love dogs and really all animals but I have a sweet spot for my baby boy akita (akita is a type of dog, not a childs name.) I work out, and actively play many sports. I have been told a handful of times that im handsome or so I hope. Im here and you should shoot me an email if you have a great sense of humor, or think we have anything in comon.

Hola chiquitas,

I'm a 27 year old single lady in SF (haaaaaay!) looking to make more friends in the area. I've lived here a year and have made pretty rad friends, but I'm looking to make a close group of friends with similar interests who are down for whatever whenever! (No I don't mean sexually).

I'm looking for the kind of friends who you can call on a weeknight to go out drinking and dancing and they are there no questions asked, shakin what our mamas gave us on the dance floor on a Wednesday night. Or just someone you can call when you're bored on a rainy day and want to stay inside and watch Broad City and eat junk food together. Or grab a 12-pack of beers and take a random trip to the beach together. 

Basically I'm looking for ride-or-die betches in the city who aren't obsessed with being in a relationship, are adventurous, goofy, and are actually good, loyal friends. 

If that sounds like you, EMAIL ME PRONTO. If it doesn't, keep on steppin. Ain't nobody got time fa dat.

I am looking for a female friend to do things with primarily on weekends. Dinners, symphony, sightseeing, tennis, hikes, you name it. I am a widower and my teenage kids tell me ""to get a life"". I have not done anything like dating since my wife passed away 5 years ago. Besides my kids, friends are telling me essentially the same . I am a supervisor where I work and the job keeps me mentally on my toes. So sometimes I just like ""chilling"" by watching a movie so we don't nessarily have to be out on the town every weekend. I am hoping whomever I meet opens me up to new sights and activities.
I am fairly open minded and not judgemental. I can debate any topic with you as long as we stay civil and respectful. I'd like to end any discourse with a smile. After all, the purpose of having a friend is to enjoy something together not to convert a mind to your thinking.
I posted in Platonic because a lot of the m4w postings are weird, drug loving or frankly are far more into sexual activity than I 'd like to go into least initially. We can stay platonic or get more involved but the impetus for deeper physical involvement will have to come from you.
I am looking for someone over 40 though I'd take a look at a younger lady of course. If your interested send me a picture of yourself and tell me a bit what you like to do for recreation. Also, I am not interested in more commuting so please be in San Francisco or within 15 miles. I will reciprocate a face picture in kind, body picture in kind and so forth. Thank you for reading the post and I hope to hear from you even if it's for one date only.

Maybe you've thought about moving to the PNW, or maybe you're just bored and want a new friend to exchange emails with. Whatever the case may be, I'm available for email or chat. Please only respond if you're going to take the time to write a decent response; no one-liners please. I appreciate well-written letters and I tend to get along with creative/intellectual types. I have been missing that type of connection lately.

So, being that I live in Seattle, you may have me somewhat figured out. I smoke weed, I drink coffee, I work in technology, and I'm progressive. I have LGBT friends and family. So, we may not mesh well if you're religious or conservative, though I'm open for debating stuff if that's your thing.

I work in IT for a popular retail company. As I mentioned, I work a night shift which leaves me fairly isolated, however I only work 3-4 nights a week, so that's nice because it allows me time to work on music and do other productive things like play video games and watch movies. I like working nights, being awake at night. It's peaceful and sort of like a whole different world. I do stay up until around noon, so it's not like I don't get to see daylight ever, but this schedule does not seem conducive to making new friends.

I play and record guitar, bass, synths, drums, and vocals. I don't have a band right now, but I'm hoping to put one together soon, and I'm hoping that playing my music live will help with meeting people. My music is sort of indie rock with some electronica. My musical tastes range from jazz like Ella Fitzgerald and Miles Davis, to bands like Tool and Radiohead. I was raised on The Beatles, Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Abba, classic rock. One of my favorite 'contemporary' bands is Pinback.

I like getting out and about when I can. There are so many great, beautiful places around Seattle to explore, hike, go camping, etc. I also enjoy traveling when I get the chance. I have been to Canada and Scotland and I'd like to visit many more places, take your pick.

I'm getting back into shape and I feel pretty good about it. I have a home gym where I work out about every other day. I'm also eating healthier; lots of vegetables and fewer carbs/sugar. I'm growing my own garden this year, too, so I'm excited about that.

So, yeah, that's a little about me, now how about you? Feel free to ask me anything, too. I look forward to hearing from you (ʘ‿ʘ)

I'll brave the weather to pick up some ice cream (what a guy)! Put your favorite flavor in the heading!

It's raining and dismal out tonight -- a perfect night to cuddle and read Rumi. Do you have a book to share?
I'm really easy going, cat friendly, keep up with the news/politics/arts. I keep fit too!
You'd like me if you enjoy reading, discussing the book or the film or the NF video. I always need to dissect what I've just taken in.
I'm in SF, near the panhandle. I sort of like the fact that it's been wet out -- I can read or do things indoors without feeling guilty! Like the laundry!
I'd love to meet up. I'm not a bar person or major drinker. I like to be around quiet cerebral people most of the time - like tonight! 
So what are you up to?

-Respond with a quick bio of who are, and what you have to offer our kegger
-Include picture of you and your crew in your best pose
-Include your phone number so we can text you the coordinates (if you pass the screening)

See you tonight,

Hi there,

With spring time around the corner, I have decided to look for someone who is interested in playing tennis once or twice a week. I have not played tennis in a long time, therefore if you are an advanced player, chances are I will only slow you down. I am more interested in ok players who want to improve or someone who, just like me, hasn't play in a while and wants to get better.
About me: early 30's, educated, down to earth, positive, christian, with morals and values.
Please, don't bother to reply if you are interested in any other things, but TENNIS!

thanks and looking forwards to our tennis match!

I bet we both are....

And yes, we are and should both married or attached...but in need and search of more since we cant really change our current situations.... I guess we have already this in common if you are still reading this ad.

I'm not alone I bet... Life is way too short to keep losing time as we are getting older everyday...

I am hoping to find a nice and sincere woman... a wise woman...attractive too...I'm mostly attracted to light complexure women....

I workout regularly and take care of myself... So I'm hoping to find a gal that likes similar things that is in good shape and takes care of herself!

We can find ourselves in situations that seemingly have no end. My wife has become more of a roommate than anything else. Circumstances that I will not go into here prevent me from leaving. Been together for a long time and now we just pass each other in the night. There are stupid arguments, stupid fights, no ugly but dormant. It's impossible to talk. Who would understand? Who would even believe? After all, we're are perceived as always been happy....We are what everyone envision as the 'perfect' marriage.

I am looking for a confident,friends with benefits, or anything with passion. I want companionship, friendship, communication, mutual respect, trust and caring. I'm looking for someone, preferably married, who may be in a similar situation and looking for a little something more in their life. Let's be each others friend, companion, confidant and possibly lovers if it goes that far. Communication is key with me. I like to exchange cute emails and chats during the day. It's simply a lot of fun because I'm a also romantic at heart.

I'm not looking to be your new husband nor am I looking for you to be my new wife. When we can, we'll steal moments away with each other.

I'm an educated hard working professional, funny, discreet, humorous, caring, polite, respectful, laid back person that knows how to treat a lady as a lady. I'm a romantic and caring person. I like to engage in funny give and take conversations with a bit of humorous bantering. I'm a passionate person who is missing much of that now in my life. I would like to meet and be with a special friend on many levels; intellectually, compassionately, as good friends that share and confide in each other and also passionately. I'm a good listener and very sensitive to the moods and needs of those close to me. Affectionate and caring. I keep my self in decent shape. If everything works out fine it will blossom into a nice romance.

Please put the "" city that you live in"" in subject replies so I know you have read me...

I love the herb. It's so relaxing. With so much shit in the world, it's a much appreciated vice.

I'm looking for a stoner girl who wants to hang out. We can go to pika pika in Japantown or get some pho downtown.

Im funny, educated, employed, and super fun to be around. I can hold just about any type of conversation, and treat people with respect.

Thanks for reading my ad and I am glad I caught your attention. I went back and forth with how I ought to title this ad and finally landed on advertising for a ""special discreet friendship."" This is my first foray into the world of seeking such a friendship since being married. I am simply interested in making my life a little more exciting, giving it an extra kick, having some intrigue. While I am still very much attached to my wife, the passion has somehow slipped away and my relationship has dulled over time. It is very comfortable, but not exciting. Do you feel that way? It may be that you and I just email each other some spicy titillating (although respectful) emails; it may be that we decide to discreetly meet and chat over coffee/tea, or maybe explore things further if we are both mutually inclined. There are lots of possibilities. As far as I am concerned, we can't go wrong...

I am a Caucasian man, tall, attractive, stocky, gym-goer, early fifties, advanced degrees, professional, live and work in San Francisco, clean-cut, respectful, and very discreet. I would love to hear from women -- married or single between the ages of 25 and 60 -- who, for whatever reasons, want to engage in a friendship in which all limits are respected yet at the same time exploration is in the cards (whether that be through e-mails, meet ups, etc.). I am honestly very open about how all of this might unfold. In the end, I do not wish to negatively impact my marriage and I don't want you (or your spouse/partner) hurt in any way; this is a very important value I hold dear and to which I am committed. 

I hope you are further intrigued by reading my ad and I hope to hear from you. I will reply to all who respond to my ad. Please tell me a bit about yourself (age, description, and any information about yourself that you would like to share) and what compelled you to answer my ad. What is your situation at the moment? What would you hope for out of a special friendship like this? I'll promise to get in touch with you soon.

I very much look forward to hearing from you... To know for sure that your email is not coming from a (ro)bot, please put the name of your favorite city in the subject line of your email. Thanks again and I hope to hear from you.

In the end, I do not wish to negatively impact my marriage and I don't want you (or your spouse/partner) hurt in any way; this is a very important value I hold dear and to which I am committed. 

I hope you are further intrigued by reading my ad and I hope to hear from you. I will reply to all who respond to my ad. Please tell me a bit about yourself (age, description, and any information about yourself that you would like to share) and what compelled you to answer my ad. What is your situation at the moment? What would you hope for out of a special friendship like this? I'll promise to get in touch with you soon.

I very much look forward to hearing from you... To know for sure that your email is not coming from a (ro)bot, please put the name of your favorite city in the subject line of your email. Thanks again and I hope to hear from you.
