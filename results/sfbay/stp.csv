Latina, 41 in search of my Super Nerdy (White) Hero

The things I would like out of this special friendship are, someone that I can connect with physically as well as intellectually. Someone I can have deep meaningful conversations to the lightest with! :) Someone to laugh and cry with. Share everything and anything, at full trust! Our secrets and only ours! Like special friends, soul mates... We can hangout, go out for lunch or dinner, have picnics, go for walks, hikes, travel/seek adventure, people watch, go to movies, or stay in, cook for each other, or together, teach me how to play videos games if you are a gamer?? =D haha. Put a flower in your head..or two! :) Be silly or cheesy together... cuddle, love each other. Simply just be together whenever we feel like, whenever life allows us to. I would like to find someone that I can care for and love, and in return do the the same for me. My heart is big and I would like to share it with someone special. It can be whatever we want it to be, as long as it is something meaningful.

I have been described by men as beautiful, cute, sexy, fun, funny, sweet and caring. To describe myself, I am caring, compassionate, passionate, hopeless romantic, sentimental, silly at times, but know when to be serious. I am a strong woman who can be vulnerable at times and I am not ashamed to say so. I have my flaws and I am very aware of them. They have helped me to learn and grow, better myself. They have made me the strong woman I am today, more and more each day. I am, simply put, a bubbly introvert.

I am attracted to younger men and they have always been attracted to me. We have always felt comfortable with each other, a special connection. I have been told I make them feel free, unleashed! And I too have always felt the same.

My preference is between the ages of mid 30's to early 40's. I am attracted to slender build (average, depending on what you define average as. Haha), shy, introverted (I find this trait rather sweet, cute, attractive!), white/Caucasian guys, fair skinned with light eyes. Green, blue... No tattoos (well actually...It depends. How big are we talking and how many??). I am sorry, but it's what I like, and I have a right to my preference. It is what it is! As you have a right to yours!

I have never seen a job take so long.

And the place sucks while it is being worked on (no pun intended).

I mean steamworks has really gone downhill, the guys there are not as good as it used to be, and it's just not fun.

I have been so disappointed the last few times I went with the renovation going on. Now the steam room is closed too; at lease it was OK to go in there even if the other areas were not as good as usual.

Do you have a secluded garden pool or even better pool and hot tub. that we could all nude sunbathe, skinny dip, and perhaps if the mood is right and strikes us have some hot sex. Perhaps you just enjoy watching and the company and friendship and perhaps if we're all attracted join in with us. We are open minded to same room (or outdoor pool area), soft or full swap and my gf is bi so girl on girl is possible and actually hoped for too. I am 5'11"" great shape white male and she is a sexy island/Asian. We can share (face & body) pics with you and we've posted just a few body pics here. If you have a pool and this sounds fun and interesting to you please write us back with your ideas or fantasies about this and hopefully an invitation for us. We like fun, laid back, non-pushy people. If you are 420 friendly and in the lifestyle we want to hear from you. We are open to if you have a community pool we can all hang at and then a condo or apartment where we can go and have fun and get naked too. Ideally we are looking for another couple or single lady but will also consider a guy too.

Going to EDC this year. Going for all 3 days. Looking for a travel and party buddy. Went to Beyond Wonderland in L.A. and it was a blast but the experience is so much better with company. Not sure if flying or driving. Road trips are so much fun, music, 420 and the open road. Maybe split the room cost. Let's have fun and become good friends, maybe if I'm lucky you'll be cute and we can make a LT connection.

Good afternoon happy Thursday !! If you like me and would enjoy having a friend to share things, thoughts, frustrations. Have some one to vent to about work family friends or just feeling down and need an ear or shoulder. Having a confidant, someone non judgemental. Talk about things you really can't or don't want to share with people you see on a daily basis or hurt someone's feeling. Add some fun excitement during the day just be yourself and not be who you need or have to be. Be silly and escape from everyday responsibilities we have to deal with day on day out. I'm hoping to develop a long term friendship with a lie minded person. Have someone I can confide and trust. 44 married Latino pretty easy going laid back. Witty, sincere, smart ass. Love to chat and have cool conversations during the day. I'm great at keeping secrets and able to share my own secrets with some one I trully trust

Sometimes it's good to just throw caution into the wind so to speak and have that good friend no one knows about. : ) if your up for it I would love to hear from you

Looking to build friendships with like-minded people. I reiterate: friendship only.

So, what's like-minded? My goal is to live a balanced life and enjoy my time here. I'm 36 (have been told I look much younger, yet act much older....sometimes....). Kind of a nonconformist, but totally accept the reality of social norms. A maker to the core and a perpetual student it would seem. Fun-loving as long as it's positive and uplifting. Pretty down to earth and casual. Introverted, but I love spending time with good people.

Love music, comedy, craft beer, $20 hamburgers (lol...), dives and holes in the wall, day trips, lectures, textiles, yarn, and cooking (every now and then). Interested in becoming healthier physically and spiritually (working on developing regular mediation/movement practice), spending more time out in nature, raising my consciousness in general.

I know that most people only browse CL for entertainment value...to see if anything can still shock their jaded sensibilities, but there are messages of genuine substance to be discovered...even here. 

I'm looking for the woman who is unhappily married but who needs to stay married for practical reasons. The woman who lacks intimacy in and out of the bedroom. What I don't want is lunch time sex. I want a woman that has the flexibility to experience life with me outside the bedroom as well. I want someone who I think about when I wake up in the morning and when I lay down at night. I want the woman who makes my heart sing when I hear her voice on my phone or get an email from her.. 

Making love is incredible when relationships are nurtured and emotional bonds are formed. I have no plans to leave the marriage that I'm in -- it's just too complicated -- but I'm not willing to live out the rest of my life unfulfilled either. 

There must be a woman who finds herself in a similar situation -- a woman who is ready to build a long-term, secondary relationship. 
Honestly, the concept of an affair seems quite easy. Two attached people make a decision to mess around and well the rest is history. However, the more complicated question is how do those two attached people make it known that they are open to such an arrangement.

About me: 

Others would typically describe me as being laid back, very funny, considerate, respectful, spontaneous and at time shy. I like sports , reading, beach/camping, independent and mainstream films, dancing, hiking, road trips, Cooking, Cricket and good restaurants ( who doesn't). But I would trade them all for a night of warmth and cuddling at home in front of a good movie and some great take out food... Care to join...(wink)


About you: 

The woman I am looking for married like me but is starved for intimacy and ready for a sensual and cerebral adventure. I am discerning and patient; this is only worth doing if it really feels right. She has darker hair and eyes...maybe olive complexion...she might be of Latin, Mediterranean, Asian, or mixed heritage. For that matter, she could be a striking brunette of any origin....the dark features are just my preference. She is fit and feminine. Her hands are soft and graceful...they fit nicely in my large grasp. 

Naturally none of us should be into games or one-nighters! If we are on the same page about what we want, send me an email -- possibly to explore this discreet, adventurous new friendship

I just got tested for the Meyers Briggs. I think the Meyers Briggs might be a bit out of date. Though if it is of any interest to you I'm ENTJ https://www.personalitypage.com/ENTJ.html
I associate myself from the lines of Vulcan from Star Trek.

When responding, I would appreciate if you can send a few info about you and what time you are able to meet me at the cafe. Thanks for being mindful of the time of agreement, as I will make reservations.

More info about me
• tea of choice: chai tea if it's available
• previous conventions attended: Developersfest, Pantheacon (I am not religious, I attended for the bellyjam) 
• previous food outing: French restaurant
• previous road trip: wine tasting / wine checking Healdsburg (I don't drink, I went w/ my honey)
• previous interesting food interaction: I shucked cacao beans
• previous game played: The Legend of Zelda
• previous shared thought: Stop acting so small. You are the universe in ecstatic motion.
• previous growth thought: developing my maturity: I apologized to valued friends, even though I was not in the wrong, there was proof. Valued friends are more important vs being adamant.

The Dowager Countess of Grantham from Downton Abbey says it best, ""If I withdrew my friendship from everyone who had spoken ill of me, my address book would be empty.""

This can be a 1 time meet up, and then we go our separate ways, or this could a few times meet up, or this could be a long term friendship. Either way I am glad you choose to spend a few hours with me at a tea hangout.

Namaste!

Looking to build friendships with like-minded women. I reiterate: friendship only.

So, what's like-minded? My goal is to live a balanced life and enjoy my time here. I'm single (well, widowed actually). I'm 36 (have been told I look much younger, yet act much older....sometimes....). Kind of a nonconformist, but totally accept the reality of social norms. A maker to the core and a perpetual student it would seem. Fun-loving as long as it's positive and uplifting. Pretty down to earth and casual. Introverted, but I love spending time with good people.

Love music, comedy, craft beer, $20 hamburgers (lol...), dives and holes in the wall, day trips, lectures, textiles, yarn, and cooking (every now and then). Interested in becoming healthier physically and spiritually (working on developing regular mediation/movement practice), spending more time out in nature, raising my consciousness in general. 

Drop me a line if you think we might be good partners in crime :)

A long time appreciator of good wine and friendly conversation I've attended this event many times and without doubt it's one of the best (second only to the Dry Creek Passport event that is). I'm a fun, open minded, knowledgeable guy who loves to laugh, chat, read, drive, sail, create, write, produce and much more and is committed to healthy living. In other words, I'm not going to get drunk but instead talk to wine makers, hang out with interesting people and see how the previous vintage wines are coming along.

I'm seeking a fun, witty, intelligent, trim, fit, young woman (late 20's - 30's) who may or may not have attended this event. The information about it can be found by doing a search for ""Sonoma County Barrel Tasting 2016"" You'll notice there are two weekends so I was thinking of a Sunday only on the second weekend

I'm single, fun, lots to talk about and willing to drive leaving from Marin. 

I have not purchased tickets yet and this is not an ad for sex, Sugar Daddy or anything similar. In other words you get your own ticket and we drive and have fun together. I know the territory very well and as Rain Man would say ""I'm an excellent driver"" too. 

I'm tall, fit, fun, smooth head, green eyes, trim, playful, intelligent and casual. This is about friendship and enjoying great wine in one of the most beautiful wine areas anywhere.

SPAMMERS: I will only respond to messages that say ""Barrel Tasting"" in the subject

A man named jed A poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed,

I used to watch the Beverly hillbillies reruns after school. life was good at home , but not at school where I was bullied and it wasn't a big deal like it is today.I remember my dad not liking me becuz I was fat, they divorced when I was in fourth grade My mom was super nice and I acted out and she didn't know why. I didn't tell her how miserable I was back then. Bless her heart. she is a great mom and I love her. I now take care of her since she has become handicapped and ill.
Im scared, I know she won't be with me for a long time. I hurt so much inside. I can't break down and show my weakness. I have to be strong for people that depend on me.
I already know I need to see someone , Im not looking for that answer,I do get exercise, I used to be a buffed guy 3 years ago, but no gym for me right now. can't take on any bills at all, having someone to talk with would be nice. I don't have many friends anymore. Guess Im just lame . I no longer have a lust for life do to all the financial crisis I am in. they say misery loves company. does anyone relate ? or I am a lost cause? I don't care if I get rude answers or spam. its easy to delete and go to the next.
I am in a reality of my own doing. I think its stupid to profess your a real person .even spam and scams are written by real people. ugh..
is anyone there? hello? can you hear me?
I don't think I am fat slob, but I can tell people are not as nice or friendly because of the extra lbs I have, I get told I look mean or look like a cop. I'm withdrawn and numb. not mean or violent. 
a distraction from my world is what I seek.

Its been awhile since I have attempted to make new friends. Somewhere along the line I have lost contact with my core friends. life happens. 
I would say there so many good reasons to establish a friendship, As we all do. I used to be so sure of what I wanted and a good judge of people. 
I work on a computer all day and since I'm self employed I can make time to check in and see how your day is or whatever topic we are on. 
Now for that gray area..if your definitely set on never ever meeting , Sharing a real pic or having a drink together at some point, we are not a match. 
just think it would be cool to have someone to talk with at the very least. Life has taken a couple unexpected turns on me. dealing with it and wondering how other people make it. 
I go to bed late , can chat or read you a bedtime story.. I am legit. Why would someone put up a platonic ad and be deceptive? well send me a message and let me know whats on your mind?

I've recently had the inclination to make a new friend. A homegirl, a super rad lady friend, a straight up doll. Someone new and interesting who is capable of knocking my socks off with their awesomeness. I'm in a relationship and my ideal friend would be too.
Some affectionate ball busting and joke cracking would be our primary deal... with maybe a little flirting if the chemistry is right.

I'm extremely picky. I value individually, creativity, hard work and a stellar comedic witt. A huge plus if you walk the line between creative bohemian and jock. Any age from 20 to 30 works for me. Well that's it for now I suppose. Hope to hear from you soon, pretty lady.

Ah yes. I can see it now -- the flow of email messages into my Inbox (cowardly masked by CL of course) telling me I am a fool. Or too wordy. Or misguided. 

But I am going to write this post and ignore the naysayers and cynics. Of course they exist in this cesspool. But relationships are all the more valuable, more meaningful and loved when one chances upon a diamond in the rough when rowing in the cesspool.

ISO a kind, attentive, romantic and adventurous woman who wants to start as friends and then move on to something more meaningful as if we are simpatico. I respect my own time so very assiduously, and hope that you are much the same. For it would mean that you are perceptive, worldly, empathetic and can hold your own without being judgmental of others. That's a rare bird.

But I have a thing for rare birds. Write and tell me your tale.

If anyone asks I'll deny it, because, you know, I am a guy and all. But I'm a wee bit lonely. And discouraged. Which makes me the guy for you! Actually, this IS in the ""strictly platonic"" category, and if I know anything about Craigslist, it's that everyone here adheres to the designated categories. So I'm not looking, per se, merely casually, slyly perusing under the universal safe word ""platonic."" Or maybe I'm not doing that at all. Maybe I'm a hapless wonder who can recite every line from ""Princess Bride"" and really think the Bay area is everything wonderful and beautiful.

If you're still reading, congratulations on being literate (I'm all about positive reinforcement ;) ). If you're entertained, you're welcome. 

I used to think I was the eternal optimist. It turns out, the longer I'm in this place in life, the shorter eternity gets.

Hello. I guess I should qualify the title to this post. I need help relocating ( this is for someone who is getting prepared for eternity, and would relocate if it would help) to Woodland Park, near Colorado Springs, CO., to live and travel on the Gospel Truth Rd. that leads to Charis Bible College and a community of believers who are awesome. I am 56 years old now, and moved to Santa Rosa for a reason that is past for a long time now and I need to move on. If I have to go alone, I will, but prefer to go with someone, as I am tired doing life by myself, although I do have a little dog named Buddy. My plan is to go in the Spring, or to just start preparing. Maybe you know of a friend or family member who would be into this? I have plenty of references, and a 2004 Toyota Corolla to get us there. And some money saved to relocate with. I am going knowing that I will receive healing there, as they have a big healing ministry you can watch live every Thursday at 12:00 our time live streaming at www.awmi.net You can check it out if you are not already familiar with Andrew Wommack ministries. Just go to Events, which will bring up a menu then click on LIVE then just watch. If must get healed, or else. The time comes when it gets down to the wire, and even if these are not the last days for the world, its my last days ( and yours) and I don't want to wonder where I will spend eternity, because we are all leaving in a wood box, or by fire. Please, Lord, let someone else be of the same mind. God Bless you. By the way, I am an ex Deadhead from living in Santa Cruz in 1979-80 just to let you know I am not a christian born into a pastor's family, but got saved in spite of the family into which I was born. But when I or we leave, I am throwing away all my Grateful Dead tapes ( I only have one anymore), and beginning fresh. I was saved in Australia in 1982, but backslid when I went to college, so I am a prodigal son on his way home from living feeding the pigs. Thanks for reading this. Have a great day! Sincerely, Gene

Why not?

And yes, we are and should both married or attached...but in need and search of more since we cant really change our current situations.... I guess we have already this in common if you are still reading this ad.

I'm not alone I bet... Life is way too short to keep losing time as we are getting older everyday...

I am hoping to find a nice and sincere woman... a wise woman...attractive too...

We can find ourselves in situations that seemingly have no end. My wife has become more of a roommate than anything else. Circumstances that I will not go into here prevent me from leaving. Been together for a long time and now we just pass each other in the night. There are stupid arguments, stupid fights, no ugly but dormant. 

I am looking for a confident, friends with benefits, or anything with passion. I want companionship, friendship, communication, mutual respect, trust and caring. I'm looking for someone, preferably married, who may be in a similar situation and looking for a little something more in their life. Let's be each others friend, companion, confidant and possibly lovers if it goes that far. Communication is key with me. I like to exchange cute emails and chats during the day. It's simply a lot of fun because I'm a also romantic at heart. I'm not looking to be your new husband nor am I looking for you to be my new wife. When we can, we'll steal moments away with each other.

I'm an educated hard working professional, funny, discreet, humorous, caring, polite, respectful, laid back person that knows how to treat a lady as a lady. I'm a romantic and caring person. I like to engage in funny give and take conversations with a bit of humorous bantering. I'm a passionate person who is missing much of that now in my life. I would like to meet and be with a special friend on many levels; intellectually, compassionately, as good friends that share and confide in each other and also passionately. I'm a good listener and very sensitive to the moods and needs of those close to me. Affectionate and caring. I keep my self in decent shape. If everything works out fine it will blossom into a nice romance.

Please be between the ages of 35-50, live in the Bay Area, easy going (with a sexy personality), decent shape as I am too. I am mostly open to most nationalities as long as they are respectful however I'm most attracted to Caucasian even thought I'm not. 

Please put "" just us"" in subject replies so I know you have read me...

Hi,

I'm a married man, not looking for anything physical rather, I'm looking for a woman, that would like to have conversations. Conversations about marriage roles, and whether or not I'm wrong in my thinking of how me, as a husband should be treated by his wife and vice versa. I consider myself a great provider, husband, partner, and father, yet, I feel that I don't get treated as such in some situations. Would love the point of view of a woman (who is blunt and honest), about how she would react if put in the situation of being my wife. 

This is not only a one sided conversation. I would be glad to play the other role and offer up advice as well, or if you just want to have someone to chat with, that's cool too. All and all, I would like this to be a fun and laid back experience that we both benefit from. Let's chat via, google hangouts or some other means of instant messaging. If you would like to exchange FB info or something similar, we can lead up to it.

The principles of Tantra are fundamental for a healthy, mature approach to life, and the things you will learn about yourself and your approach to intimacy will empower you to change your life for the better. Our goal is to learn, understand and experience following:

- Live authentically and true to our self 
- Live healthy and attract quality people
- Enhance self awareness
- Develop sensual sensitivity
- Manage and Heal from past trauma and abuse. Overcome internal blocks
- Retain sexual energy, channel it to pervade all areas of your life and move to higher state of consciousness

I have some experience with the practice, interested in enhancing experiences and enjoy the host of benefits for our overall well-being. I'd be interested in a partner who is patient and eager to learn about this practice. I'm clean, very respectful, and spiritual.

I'm looking for partners to practice the art of Tantra. It's the art of connection and patience that involves trust building, yoga, touching, massage and mutual gazing. 

Age, race and body composition are unimportant. What's required is a good introduction! Please be, intelligent, adventurous and conversational.

I have no idea if this will work, but here goes nothing :-) I am a single mid-30s female and I am expecting a baby in the next year. Many of my friends are without kids or the ones who have them are far away. I am a straight woman, just looking to meet other moms in hopes that we can hang out with our kids on fun outings and help each other out when needed. It doesn't matter to me if you're single or in a relationship. Prefer someone relatively close by (anywhere in the east bay is great) and with young kids. I am hoping to build a nice community of mothers where we know each other and our kids grow up together. If this appeals to you, hit me up :) Thanks and have a great day!

I have 2-tickets (good seats-1st balcony). The friend I was going with, got a better offer. So, I need someone to take their place. I know it is last minute, so I am not selling the ticket and no strings would be attached (like the ad says, strictly platonic).

You can go with me for free (I 'may' want 1-drink, though). The concert starts at 730pm and will end around 10pm. You would be free to leave at any time (if you really can't stand to be with me after we meet?).

I can tell you I am 60-years old, white/bald, 5'9"" tall and 190lbs. I love music of all kinds and I'm an overall good-guy. You must be female (any age, preferably close to mine?). I don't care about your ethnic background, as long as you love music (preferably R&R because 'Satch' plays predominately R&R).

Get back to me as soon as possible. I will choose based on my gut feelings about you, so give me some feedback. Thanking all, in advance.

Really not looking for anything sexual, just friends who like to hang out, do activities, even go to places nude.

How come most of the nudists are of a certain age and certain body type? Are there any guys my age (40's) or even younger (30's/20's) who like/want to explore nudism?

Decent looking, Filipino guy here, easy going, carefree, go to the gym, have an average body, but that shouldn't be a hang up when you're just hanging out right?

Oh and if you're going to lecture me about what being a nudist is, don't.. go post your own ad or even better mind your own business. Thanks for reading.

Enough of that I will get into more detail when we talk. Anyway I want a woman to be a good listener and be a best friend for me. We can talk on the phone and see each other as friends to a social drink or a place when we both are available I would like to meet and talk to a married woman that is also in a same relationship/marriage as me. I am a good listener and also I try to make things right on whatever your going thru I am a sweetheart that has a heart and that has alot of respect to woman trust me you will get to know me on how I really am, I am no creep nor am I wierd. I have a good career and we can get into details when we talk.

Honestly I want out of this marriage and I will tell you why when we talk. I want a good a friend to start things off slow. I even want a woman to guide me on how to cope with what I am going thru. Honestly I am a good guy and I will show you that I promise. Message me friend :-)

This is a little unconventional for me to do something like this but I'll try and be as specific as possible and will respond back to those I feel are a match. I am an asian/white female, early 30's, live a pretty open minded lifestyle and bisexual. I would prefer to make friends with someone who understands that part of me without feeling judged. I'm not interested in making any new friends with girls who are attached or married because unfortunately all of my current friends started being homebodies because of their significant others. I'm sure there are girls who are the exception but I prefer to make single friends for now. I'm 420 friendly, very fit and environmentally conscious, an artist and musician, dancer, lover, giver, and most importantly open minded. If you can relate, write me back and let's play it by ear. I enjoy being kind to strangers and hopefully this will be the start to a great friendship.

If anyone sees this and knows her, it would be awesome to know how she is. I am not some weird stalker. She was the first person to tell me I was gay.
My name is Dan Blair & we hung out with Mike Sherman.

The best friendship I ever had was with a married woman. She was not getting support in her marriage. Of course we didn't see each other as often as we would have liked, but its not the quantity of time that's important, what's important is the quality of time. 

I want a connection again. I'm looking to form a connection. We feel a connection whether we are sharing happy things in our lives or sad things. I am a good listener and all ears :)

Hi! This is what platonic means:

Etymology
Variant of Platonic, which see. The sense ""non-sexual"" dates to the 17th century in English, and to the 15th century in Latin; see platonic love for details.

Pronunciation
(UK) IPA(key): /pləˈtɒnɪk/
(US) IPA(key): /pləˈtɔnɪk/
Adjective
platonic ‎(comparative more platonic, superlative most platonic)

Not sexual in nature; being or exhibiting platonic love.
They are good friends, but their relationship is strictly platonic.
Alternative letter-case form of Platonic (of or relating to the philosophical views of Plato and his successors).

If you can't figure that out, please stop reading!

I am HAPPILY MARRIED

I am UGLY and FAT!

I am a pedestrian. (I don't drive, which makes me a burden on society, of course.)

I enjoy classic board games, card games, story telling, and vintage entertainment.

(Might as well get all the boring stuff explained.)

you're more simple than complex
aren't too into material things
can laugh
can talk
can cry


i'm from the midwest. i'm almost 6 feet tall. basketball is my favorite sport to watch, golf my favorite to play. i'm very random, will say the most random things and am pretty outgoing. or i can just be chill. it all depends on the situation. i like hiking a lot too. or just sitting and talking....or listening because i know that the majority of females like to talk. 
so if any females out there find this appealing and want a good guy friend, hit me back and we can start chatting!

Winter is here and it's time to go exploring. I have a good amount of friends, my problem is they are mostly men, and i'd like to change that. The few female friends i do have are married/have kids/moved far away. It is time for me to meet a new great friend to have on my side. As for me i'm single, no kids and have a flexible schedule so i can get up and have fun at a moments notice. I'm fun, sarcastic, laid back but outgoing, social and easy to get along with (yup, all the cliches). I'm looking for more than just an ""acquaintance"" or ""party friend."" I'd like a close friend that is as fun and laid back as me. Some things i love: reading, cooking (i tend to make my friends gain a few pounds, i apologize in advance), dancing all night followed up by some late night Denny's, concerts, festivals, plays, workout, hike. I BBQ on almost a weekly basis with friends and every Sunday when The Walking Dead is on I have a Walking Dead get together which consists of pizza, alcohol, Walking Dead discussion followed up by a trip to the bar after the show. I also used to do that for True Blood, but the season is over. Anyway, i'm ready to get this party started! Email me if you feel we will click and you can get out more than ""Once in awhile."" I'm not looking for someone ""casual."" More a friend that i can rely on, and that can rely on me for anything and also to have some fun and amazing nights out with. I'm checking out a bar in my area tonight. Maybe you can come??!! All i ask is that you be as fun and laid back as me, and please be mobile.
Gay men are welcomed to email me!

So honestly how is your marriage, ever think it is not what you thought it would be? I have been pondering that question a lot and, I just don't seem to understand things. I believe in communications and being honest, and truthful. Do you ever feel that you husband or partner is not really their for you and does not really understand you or is listening to you. I am not trying to bash anybody, but I do believe that marriage is an equally partnership, and we must always be open. I am just looking to talk to others that feel the someway.

Hi, I am a married man and I am looking for a woman who would like to write with me on occasion. 

Sometimes it is just nice to get a different POV from someone of the opposite gender other than a spouse.

We can write about jobs, family, fun activities, whatever.

I would prefer that we share at least some commonalities. I am college educated, a professional, in my early fifties. I have traveled extensively and I keep up to date on most current events.

Please do not respond if you don't know the difference between your and you're; their, there, and they're. You get what I'm mean.

Why don't we just start with an introduction. Tell me why you chose my post to reply to,what you are looking for and a little about yourself.

Thank you.

I am a husband and father who enjoys receiving massage. I admire and value the sacred space created by practitioners, to heal the body and quiet the mind. Bodywork has proven integral to my well being, as both a pleasant and practical form of facilitated meditation.

But a massage isn't something I can afford to have often. So, instead of paying to feel this way, I'd rather massage others for free. Performing bodywork lets me repay the patience, generosity, and attention that I received on the table. Moreover, I gain a very different sense of myself, which is truly a gift all its own.

My offer is simple, straight forward, and easy to attain: have a body that you want massaged. We'll coordinate schedules, then meet once, or regularly. My intention is to heal, connect with, and relieve your physical body.

I am a professional Black male, in my late thirties, of average weight and height. My personality type (ENTP) emphasizes thinking over feeling, which explains this lengthy post and my pursuit of sensate connections. My wife understands me best of course, and is my rock in this endeavor. She recognizes my need to be used, tasked, and encouraged by women. Through this ad, she is allowing you to do just that.

I've offered my time and attention via Craigslist in the past, and may provide references - if not, testimonials. I'm available for 1 to 3 hour sessions, most evenings, weekends, and Fridays. You can visit my modest Berkeley studio, or I can travel to you, within 30 minutes of Lake Merritt. I own a portable table, use draping, and have been privileged to work with various body types, abilities and conditions.

Please note that I am merely a student of touch, with no formal training. If you have any relevant ailments or medically diagnosed concerns, you are strongly advised to inform me. I can research and prepare, but ultimately trust that you know your health best. Above all else, I encourage feedback, and will dutifully adjust my stroke for your comfort.

My style is an intuitive mix of Swedish, Esalen, Lomi Lomi, and Thai stretches. I'm also familiar with the sacrum, psoas, glutes, adductors, and some lymph systems. You're welcome to inquire about your preferred modality as well - learning them expands my capacity to serve. Whatever the request or preference, I aim to deliver what you need to relax.

I welcome all inquiries. The most common one asks why I do this for free. While there is no fee, your presence and attention are invaluable. Caring for others helps me focus, open up emotionally, and simply be grateful. Giving is a chance to be present, which allows me to see my own patterns and solve my own problems, more easily. Not only is money a hurdle to having these moments, it often diminishes their value.

I hope to have written enough that you might respond with the same confidence, good faith and gratitude that I've attempted to display. Should you reply, please include a reasonable introduction, and what you can about your unique massage goals, needs, and/or concerns. Simply include your photo if you would like mine, in kind. Otherwise, expect to voice verify or meet and greet before booking. Finally, title your response ""somatic healing"", so I might weed out spam.

Thank you for reading all of this through. Be well!

I know this is a long shot but it is craigslist so you never know. I am planning on taking some time off work next week (Tues through Thurs) . I just want to go do something fun and would love some company. I am posting this on SP because it doesn't have to involve sex. I just like to talk and chat and maybe go to dinner etc.

So this is what I was thinking, I got my convertible ready and gas'd up!

Option 1 :

Reno - I got free rooms at Eldarado, we can get 2 beds, 

Option 2:
Coastal Drive - Maybe go near Hertz Castle?

I am open to other ideas too. If you are interested, please send me your stats and I will send you mine. We can meet first for coffee to make sure that we are comfortable with each other.

I don't care if you are married or not, young or old, just as long as you can let loose and have some fun.

What do ya think?

You would think the spouse is the one who will help you get through these years of questioning, career changes, being a parent, or just trying to make sense of your place in the world. But sometimes that's not the case. Conversations with your lover can just go in circles, be mundane, turn into arguments, lead to more frustration, and just leave you with more questions than answers. So I'm looking for another female friend, to talk with, walk with, meet and smile and laugh about the situations we find ourselves in, whether you're attached or single. No one has to know about us, it'll just be you and me making a connection and staying in touch, because I'm not really connected with all the people I used to know and everyone's gone their separate ways. I've made very few new friends, mostly coworkers, and some stay in touch and some don't. Hopefully you're local to San Jose and staying around for the long term. I really need a consistent friend, and I'm not anticipating anything romantic, although you never know what may happen and where life might find us a few years down the road. So if you feel what I'm feeling in you're close to my age, and think you can relate, let me know.

I'm twenty eight, no kids, never married I like to play sports, listen to music, watch movies etc. . . Despite how I write I'm a really silly guy and don't try to take too many things too seriously because of this, plus life's short. I live in Vallejo, but that doesn't mean the woman for me has to be here as well. I don't think the woman for me has to be within a 5-mile radius and it's pretty narrow-minded to think so. I'm looking for a woman who is willing to hang out frequently, I understand not everyone would be and that's find just disregard this whole ad if this isn't you. If it is then keep reading. As far as the kind of women I like I like sweet women who have an innocent side but also a flirtatious one when need be, someone clean of course, faithful, loyal and not a liar. I'm not into married women or women who are still living with their ex or who sleep around a lot. Also if you currently have any friends with benefits I'm not interested. Physically I like a thick woman who has a very large/'huge butt, a lot of women think they do, (or try to give the illusion they do by standing sideways or sitting on a sink), but I've noticed they don't, at least not to my standard. I'm all black; I tend not to care about race too much though.

I don't think what I am asking for in a woman friend is that much but maybe it is when it comes to women nowadays because it seems like women nowadays always gotta have sex in their lives somewhere. Why is it a bad thing that I am not looking for sex? Shouldn't women be glad to find a man who doesn't want to have sex with them but actually wants to get to know them and be in their company? I know what you might be thinking but I am by no means gay I just don't have the desire for sex but I do have the desire for friendship and companionship. I don't know if it is too much to ask but it seems like but all I am looking for is a good friend who has time to spend with me doing fun and memorable things (ex: bowling, shooting pool, dancing, looking at the stars, movies, etc). I hopefully would like to meet a woman who would be my best friend, somebody who I can talk mess to but know its all for fun and not serious. Somebody who won't just disappear on me if something tragic happens in their life and know it's better to have a good friend at those times than to be alone. Also what would be great but not required is to have a friend who is kind of on the thicker side and I don't mean by women standards but by men standards and trust me those are two different standards. I say that because I would like a friend who is ok with some flirting being allowed in our friendship without you developing sexual urges because I found out most women can't.

A little about me I reside in Valleo I am 28 I am 6'2 black stocky build brown skin brown eyes full lips deep voice facial hair, I drive, I work, no kids, don't smoke, or drink, or do drugs. So if you are interested in what I have to say please feel free to reply and not the women who just want to hate or complain about what I said but real women who are interested please type ""Interested"" as your subject title when you email me thanks.

You are open-minded, intelligent, active, humorous and honest.
You know how to laugh at yourself and are naturally playful.
You welcome the depth of a philosophical discussion while also embracing silly banter.
Your mind works quickly, and you are sure of who you are and what you want.

To me, your race, age, or physicality is not important. Your self-confidence is.

I am fit because I thrive on being active. I'd like to find someone who enjoys hiking or road cycling, because eventually we might want to do things together. I find that women bring a unique perspective, and I appreciate that.

It would be great to go to the movies, take scenic walks, dine out and just be spontaneous with someone who's open to living life without holding back. Ultimately I do want to meet ""the one"" and hey, if that happens here even better but that isn't at all what I'm expecting. 

I've only had one sb/sd relationship in my life and that lasted almost five years. It was mutually rewarding but like all good things it peacefully ended. As you can see I'm looking again for someone who equally loves adventure but can mix it in with a sexual arrangement. I love trying new things and it doesn't have to be all about sex but I do want that as part of the agreement. I'm sure you appreciate straightforwardness. 

I love a girl who can still wear heels when we stand next to each other. Don't count yourself out if you're petite :) I'm over 6ft, cute, tall and considered a handsome man. I'm disease free and will always try to make time for someone who's good in bed and a great friend. I'm looking for someone cute with a great personality, brain, and sense of humor! I'm looking for a long term friend with benefits, not just a one time, nsa thing. A weekly stipend is what I was thinking and I'm good for it.

If this is what you're looking for please share what your expectations for a stipend type of arrangement would be like? How many times a week do you think realistically you could meet up? Are you single? Is your place available some of the time or would we always have to come to my place? When you write feel free to ask me any questions you may have. Please tell me a bit about yourself as well as send some good pictures. I will be happy to answer anything and send pictures of myself.

When an attractive guy has an education and a good job, people ask why is he still single this late in the game? Girls ask specifically, ""What's wrong with him?"" I'll be perfectly honest. I've had back to back long term traditional relationships before having an arrangement and this is something that just works for me right now. I plan on settling down one day but the problem right now is that I work and travel a lot. 

I really, really like my job, and unfortunately it requires me to go places on short-notice. I do a lot of driving all over California and along the West. My schedule gets in the way of dating and this situation works perfectly for a student or someone who has equal needs. I don't think it would be an issue if I had a long-term girlfriend, but it's a big problem when you're trying to get past the first few dates just getting to know each other and the girl discovers that my schedule is just all over the map.

The girl I'm looking for is anywhere between 5'2''-5'9'' with blonde, brunette or red hair. She has blue, green or hazel eyes and is slim and takes care of herself. I'm open to HWP as long as you take care of yourself and stay healthy and active. I love a girly girl but also a girl who doesn't mind getting her hands dirty. I'm open to different ethnic groups. :) 

With all of this said, are you that someone who's open to a friend's-with-benefits scenario while being compensated for it? I'm pretty sexual and frankly it's difficult to find somebody who can accommodate my schedule. I think if we didn't expect a big emotional commitment from each other then maybe it would be simpler. I'm not really interested in being a ""player."" No games. To be honest, I'm not opposed if we do end up developing feelings for each other but that's down the road. Who knows what could happen....

We play at Twin Creeks in Sunnyvale on Thursday nights on a gay league. You definitely do not have to be gay.....it's about 50% straight...BUT...you have to be gay friendly. 

It's a really fun league with a great group of players. Our team is looking for a few players (men or woman) to join us for the Spring League which starts April 7th. Games range from 6:40pm to 9pm. They are 55 minutes long.

We are a C-team which means that you must have played baseball and/or softball before and have some experience. This is slowpitch softball. We play to have fun and of course compete;)

Let me know if you might be interested and can commit to Thursday night games at Twin Creeks in Sunnyvale. Summer league is $135. There are no gate fees.

If interested send me an email with a little information/background.

I am a desi working male in south bay....

I am looking for a very specific indian lady for friendship. If you are bored from your daily grind and mundane working life and need a new desi male for good conversation and friendship with new experiences and a different twist, I would be the person you would be friends with.

If you are looking for a friendship, which is based on ""barter"" system, then please consider me. I would be very much willing to get you a dress or two from a store (if you are running short of chash), or get you lingerie or panties/bra from Victoria Secret or similar store. You are willing to consider a fun friendship. 

What am I seeking? Well, not exactly what you think, but close to.

How about trading cooking recipes with me? How about cooking me a sample of any famous or favorite dish that you are good at cooking? May be I can learn few things. I am reasonably good at cooking, but always looking for new cuisine. May be Indian, may be non-Indian. can you barter this kind of trade with me? If you want to make it slightly more fun, then you might consider some non-sexual kind of fun too!

See thing is, I'm attached and will need to stay alone for few months while spouse is out of country and looking for a very fun way to get to know a new woman and make friends with!

We can talk about different bartering scenarios if you wish.
After all the ""Benefit"" in ""Friends with benefit"" always comes with some kind of trade offs.

Hence, clothes for cooking, or clothes for mild-fun, or clothes for some other kind of benefit, would be good!

Or how about clothes for massage?
Or cooking for massage?
(I give great full body massage!)....

I'm a handsome desi man, good looking, fit and trim, in good shape and take good care of myself!

Regards

So.. Here's the situation: I'm a dude lookin for some new friends. Thing is, I've never had a problem makin friends with other guys. Girls though, that's a different story. It may be possible that I've just been introduced to the wrong ones. THOSE ""friends"" normally just wanted to hang out during parties, drink all my liquor and then they'd disappear till the next party. And they'd normally want a free ride to and from the party. Not down for that. I mean, don't get me wrong, I definitely wouldn't mind having a friend that I can drink with, in fact, I enjoy drinkin with my friends, but I'm looking for friends I can also kick it with when we're NOT drinkin.

About me: Half Hispanic, half Filipino, I like movies, tv, music, art, video games, beer, hanging out, drivin, among other things.

You: Be awesome, like similar things, be around my age like somewhere around 20-30, live near my area.

Fun Fact: If you're a Legend of Zelda fan, we might be besties. If you dislike Legend of Zelda, we might be mortal enemies.

Anywayz, if you're lookin for a new friend, I'm here. Send me an email if you're interested. If you wanna just text first that's cool with me, but I would like to kick it eventually. I'd write more about myself, but I feel that's something that we could talk about when we kick it. Also, I didn't post a pic cause this is Craigslist and I think it's weird, but I'll send one if you want, and I'd want one in return. I mean, I would like to place a face to the person I'm talkin to.

Or Kik me: S_Flame

Hope to hear from you soon!

If your response is too short, bromidic, or dumb, it'll be appropriately tossed. I hope this plan works well for you: We exchange 2-3 emales, I submit my phone #, you call, I reveal my precise address. If you are my type, you won't be pusillanimous about phoning. Let us simplify this tender rendezvous, eh? We meet at my hacienda...not at a cacophonous, players' cafe' that sells transparent cafe' with ersatz cream.

When we get better acquainted, & b4 we meet, I'll send my photo. I prefer men who are light-complexioned & hairy. However, this posting is about imminent friendship, & so your surface is not important to me unless it's unclean & emits vapors. Who knows who Mrs. Taggart is? Win a prize if you guess correctly.

As for sex, though I am not looking, I may not be opposed to it either. Anyway, what I am looking for is a friendship, someone to get to know.

Hi there! 
I am an attractive male looking for female dance partners. I love to dance which seems to be a bit out of the norm for a guy to be the one needing it. I truly love to feel the music flow throuh my body and express it the best way I know how....... and I don't mean straight up aggressive bump and grind pelvic thrusts although there is a time and a place for that. Lol. 

I am a soulful, classy, fun, sexy, energetic, smoooooooooth, and controlled dancer. By all means I am not a professional dancer... but professional dancers are whom I'd likely vibe with the best. Hopefully that doesn't scare too many off... I just have good rhythm and soul and want to share it with someone who gets it too.

If interested in a super fun night out on the town full of no pressure, no expectation dancing... again all about the dancing.... lets connect! 

Im 32, Caucasian, attractive, fit/ toned, tattoos, respectful of boundaries, respectful of space, can take a hint, can make us both feel sexy out there... 

Will love to dance to anything and everything but likes reggae, soul, funk, blues, rnb, hip hop, top 40, electronic..... anything soulful. :)

Please tell me a bit about yourself, when you want to get out, and maybe a photo? I'll return the favor. :)

I'm a 31 year old (single, white, if that matters) guy who lives a busy (work)life. I'm a heavy set guy (284lbs, 6'1"") and I have been gaining weight a lot lately due to inactivity and unhealthy eating habits. I live in the city and I work in tech industry as a software engineer. I really love my job and that kinda makes me a bit of a workaholic. I don't have much of a life outside of work which often manifests as me staying at the office at late hours. When I'm not working I like to read books(mostly sci-fi), watch tv shows, go to movies, play xbox, catch up on science and technology. When I manage to take time off from work, I really like going for walks around the city and hike the coastal trails.

I'm looking for someone who is in a similar life situation. Basically if any of the following applies:
- busy life and struggles to keep weight down
- makes excuses for not exercising
- really want to get healthy but need a push and someone to motivate you
- are already healthy and/or fit, but would like someone to work on and motivate

I don't care if you're married, in a relationship or single. I would really like to stress that I am not looking for a romantic relationship of any kind and I am not hoping this to develop into anything more than a friendship. No ""casual"" encounters or anything like that. One thing I do ask is that if you are in a relationship or in a marriage and your partner tends to be jealous kind, I'd ask you to skip this ad. I am all about no drama, and I do not want to spend time making excuses or doing things in secret because of your partner.

What I am looking for is an activity partner for walking, hiking, gym and/or just exploring the city. Basically I would like to find someone I could make plans with to go for walks and have an excuse to not stay at work so late. :)

Just send me a mail and we can get to know each other a little better and go for a coffee or something. I'm not a creep and I'd also like to verify that you're not one, so meeting in a public place first would be ideal.

While I find self-identifications like ""intellectual"" to be smug, pretentious and mostly ill-fitting for someone like me, it nonetheless seemed like a catchy subject title that might attract a less perverted, more refined cross-section of people. 

Having briefly perused the personals on here on both the mens' and womens' sides, I am not writing this post with a wide-eyed hope for a multitude of promising responses. But I do hope that among the numerous responses I will receive from the multitudes of swine (who will no doubt attach gratuitous genitalia pictures,) and from hostile misanthropic jerks with a penchant for writing scathing insults, that a few pearls might emerge. What constitutes a pearl among swine? I am not sure. If I am pearl myself, I certainly feel lackluster.

So about me...I am a university student in my twenties, and I suffer from a chronic depression with some rather debilitating stripes. I do not have any problems identifying the indispensable good and positive growth that has come out of my experience with academia, but the bad (the elitism, the enormously sensitive egos of some academics, the condescension, the competition, the demoralizing criticism, and the sometimes poor regard for ethical, fair treatment), has left me disillusioned. I sometimes wonder if I will continue onto graduate school or not. At this point, I have far from realized career ambitions that I entertain with fluctuating hope. The future feels dauntingly precarious, and I am not very good at smiling into the uncertain abyss and welcoming the unexpected tide.

My depression includes hours of wallowing, sulking and brooding. I often lay around draping blankets over myself producing a cavernous effect and ruminating over the pain I have, focusing closely on the pain so that interjections of hope and positive thinking are reduced to sounding like irritating whispers. I often dwell over haunting memories of social humiliation, events of social humiliation that could have been avoided had I been more prudent and reserved about the things I chose to say and write. I do, it seems, have a history of social error associated with a poor regard for diplomatic politics or a poor regard for knowing which battles to pick, and not letting go of my anger, and instead saying and/or writing all the wrong things to express my anger. I sometimes construct ""what if"" hypotheticals and imagine the favorable outcomes that might have occured had I behaved properly and not committed the social errors. My depression also includes a rather self-loathing, hopeless internal monologue marked by variations of saying to myself: ""I am ugly. I am in adequate. I am not intelligent enough. I am a failure. Life is pointless. Why do I bother?"" I do not entertain existential questions about the meaning of life with a gallant curiosity, but rather a morbid defeatism. To many it is not troubling that life is inherently meaningless and that one needs to give it meaning, but to me this meaning assignment feels contrived and artificial. I'd much rather life have meaning independent of the meaning I could ever assign to it, and that some higher power (not necessarily a supernatural deity) could spell things out for me. This is a very common sentiment, I know. Feel free to yawn or scowl at how terribly banal my troubles are.

In spite of this debiliating depression, I guess I am moderately-high functioning. I am functional enough to perform decently to quite well on my my coursework, and attend courses on school days. I am functional enough to entertain fluctuating hopes and ambitions. I am functional enough to sometimes look for inspiration and a spark to carry on. I am functional enough to see if I can be more resilient. I am functional enough to write this ad, (though taking the time to post something like this in a place like this probably speaks more to dysfunction.)

So I am reaching my quivering hand into this cyber cesspool in hopes that I might find someone similar, someone who has been in this cavern, or who is still there, or who has emerged and has been on a mostly upwards trajectory since. My hope is that after exchanging many detailed, introspective, psycho-analytic, thoughtful letters and discussions with a like-minded person, that I might find something short of catharsis if not a greater, less fluctuating will to live. My hope is also to derive meaning and self-importance from being valued similarly in someone else's life -- if not valued as a pillar of support to someone, then as an indispensibly special person to them. And finally, my hope is to build a connection that makes me eventually feel strong enough to not feel I have to lean on others. I would like to be strong enough to one day stand on my own feet.

There are certain personality/mental types I particularly favor: I like someone who has a dominant, assertive personality, but a dominant personality who does not lead with a controlling and/or arrogant foot, but who leads rather with a firm confidence as well as a compassionate regard for my views and preferences. I favor someone who is very reassuring and who won't grow tired or conspicuously annoyed with giving me assurances. I like someone who won't consider dealing with my depression to be a task or burden. (At worst, you may find dealing with my depression an ethical duty, but it best I would hope you derive some happiness and self-importance from it.) I like someone who is good at reading non-verbals (since I can be a timid, awkward communicator) and someone who can be forward and caring enough in their communication style to help me communicate better. I like a very conciliatory person who won't receive my grievances in defensive anger and criticism and who is instead constructive enough to listen to them, not walk away, and try to mend the rupture and reconcile. I like someone who appreciates very candid psychological admissions and who can reciprocate in such candid discussions and eventually not hold anything back about his life. I like someone who can stomach and respond compassionately to graphic detail regarding morbid ideation instead of recoiling in repulsion and abandoning me. I favor someone who will not flake and have unexplained absences, and someone who is intent on building an enduring connection and who has enough time and sense of commitment to keep in regular touch.

While psychologically, emotionally intimate discussions can set the scene for a budding romance, I imagine an amorous connection could potentially impede or complicate my aim for managing my depression (as well as your aim for managing depression, if that is your aim.) But I am open, in due time, to warm embraces and platonic affectionate gestures. I think this is an important barrier and that we should honor it for the sake of our health and for the sake of ensuring an enduring connection.

After exchanging thoughtful letters, texts and phone calls, I imagine these sorts of outings: taking BART from city to city and getting off at your favorite stops where you will lead the way, catching a good movie at a movie theatre, drinking hot tea while walking around a lake at night, lying down on the grass or sitting on a bench and sharing our ruminations and dreams, me resting my head on your shoulder as you comment elaboratively and sometimes humorously on the people who walk by, going on long bike rides at night with music with you leading the way and caring for me if I clumsily get injured, engaging in unabashed voyeurism at quirky venues or in general, looking at antique furniture together (which you will know more about than me), going to museums (which you will be better at talking your way through), reading to one another, sitting and listening to music together (preferring melancholy scores over sulking excessively with the painful tracks of The Smiths, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Elliott Smith, Joni Mitchell and Radiohead etc.,) me spending a weekend at your far from bio-hazardous relatively clean place where we watch movies together, eat well, rearrange your living space if you find that fitting and have staring contests cut by interludes of shouting non sequiturs and obnoxious giggling if not flatulence. Finally, I imagine coming out of our time spent together feeling uplifted, stronger, hopeful, needed and important. I imagine feeling that I have secured a long-term comrade and confidant. But maybe that is an all too loaded, idealistic and thus dangerous expectation to have. Perhaps I ought to look forward to what pleasant time someone can offer while they can offer it and appreciatively live in the moment and condition myself to expect less since one of my self-help aims is learning to be less needy and dependent and expectant. 

I thought I would end this ad (which will no doubt attract gratuitous genitalia photos and insults like ""You think you have it so bad, huh?"" or ""You sound so pretentious and demanding!"" or unsolicited trite advice like ""Just get out more! Be positive!""), by listing some academic interests/pursuits: journalism, social welfare, sociology (an intersectional perspective that accounts for race, class, sexuality and other social stigma), doing archival/historical research, rhetoric/argumentation, social activist efforts, ethnic and gender studies, African diaspora studies, history (early to present U.S., medieval to modern Europe, South Asia and the Middle East, th ancient Near East, etc.,) political science (early to present party ideology and party politics, voter habits, race and gender in party politics), critiquing idealogues and pop culture, film studies, comparative literature (deconstruction, literary theory, semiotics, the activity of interpretation/comparing interpretation methods, assessing which and why what literary interpretations are more optimal than others, comparing Enlightenment era thinkers, etc.), philosophy (have been largely unsuccessful with Kant, Wittgenstein, Frege and many others,) etc.

Well, fellow depression-survivor, I look forward to hearing from you. Feel free to write at length -- I do appreciate detail and a thoughtfulness for crafting prose, be it a less controlled prose style reminiscent of the melodramatic introspection of Virginia Woolf or Proust, or the more controlled, snide, economical command for epigram of Oscar Wilde, mixed in with the somehow endearing bitterness of Allen Ginsberg. I like many types of writing and writers, (so long as you do not seem too eerily close to Nolan's protagonist from ""Following."") In your response, please tell me your age, what you do (work, school, etc), what your daily routine is like, how much free time you have in your schedule for keeping in touch (I favor regular texting at the very least and weekly if not bi-monthly outings), what area you live in, whether or not you like going on long drives, what your interests/hobbies are, what is the nature of your depression, what treatments you have already tried and what you hope to change, what you hope to get out of our correspondence, why you choose to live, etc.

Hi everyone! 

I am diving in the craigslist waters searching for my awesome mermaid loving, unicorn tribe of amazing people!

I am a free spirit, creative, non judgmental, educated, compassionate, outgoing, adventurous woman. I love exploring, traveling, great food, photography, writing, art, museums, galleries, comedy shows, being at the ocean and spending time with my loved ones. I can easily dress up for a night out on the town or dress down and go to a bar or go to watch a live game.I am very adaptable and fit in with most groups very nicely.

I have a very loving, sweet, genuine nature. I am part unicorn, part mermaid, part ganja goddess. I am an advocate, supporter and writer regarding cannabis. I have chronic pain and cannabis has helped save my life and it is important for my friends and partner to be completely accepting an understanding of that and my passion for attending festivals and cannabis related events.

I currently live in Santa Rosa and I am a pinup model by the name of Red Velvet. I am with a group called The Classic Bombshell Beauties and we raise money for our local veterans. I am trying to move to San Francisco within one month. 

I'm looking to make friends all over San Francisco and just put inner Richmond because I have a love of Ocean Beach and I am truly hoping to live around that area but that is still an uncertainty at this point.

I am looking for friends who will love, appreciate and be genuinely interested in making real and lasting friendships.
I am looking for people who are mindful, non judgmental, outgoing, respectful, kind, loyal and genuine. I would love to meet friends who enjoy adventures, traveling, festivals, exploring the city, creating shenanigans, starting wild random groups, having game night's, going to the farmers market and then cooking together and watching fun reruns of old school shows together. People who love life, exploring the world around us and showing compassion to others. I love art and I would love for my friends to join me in that! 

I look forward to meeting you all and creating long-lasting friendships and terrific memories!

Hey how are you doing I hope your Holidays were good and I am just posting an ad on here because I am looking to change things for the New Year and that means I am trying to gain a new friend for the New Year. I am looking for somebody who is real coo and laid back and I mean somebody who likes to laugh as well as laugh at themselves. For some reason people seem to think that nowadays when somebody says to Netflix and chill is something sexual but with me it means just that because there is a lot of good movies and shows on Netflix. I have to state this but I am not looking for sex, repeat I am not looking for sex so that means no fwb situation involving sex but I am however looking for a woman friend I can flirt with. Also it is a shame that I have to state this too but I am only looking for women who were born women and women who are single and not married or in a relationship. I the type of guy who will give you attention like text you out of nowhere or have fun and funny conversations and trust me if I was in your life you would be laughing whenever you talked to me or laughing about what I said the last time you talked to me. 

I am 6'2 stocky thick build brown chocolate skin brown eyes full lips deep voice facial hair big hands and feet no tattoos only my ears pierced. I don't sag my pants and I always wear a belt and I always like to smell good whenever I leave the house. I don't discriminate on anybody so I like all races of women and I don't care about age as long as you're over 18. I am trying to bring happiness to your life and I am not going to give you any money, use you or abuse you in any way, I just want you to be yourself and I just want to see that beautiful smile. So if that all sounds well and good than please respond with ""2016"" as your subject title when you reply.

Ladies I know every time you search online you always see guys looking for sex and I know that gets annoying. I hope you're like me and think to yourself why can't I find a good friend without sex being involved? I feel the same way because I am looking for a woman who not trying to have sex but wants to have a good friend to be on their side. I am looking for attention and flirtation instead of sex, I want fun times and good memories. I want to find a friend who I can go and visit new places with and just have a good time. I already have a few places that I looked up that I would love to visit but the thing is visiting new places by yourself is really boring but going with a friend makes things more fun and exciting. I would love a woman friend who is outgoing and not too closed in or shy but not too outrageous either. Like I said I love attention so a woman texting me all the time or send me pictures is not a problem to me and it never has been, because I figure I pay for mine phone monthly I might as well use it right? When I say flirtatious I am talking about I want a woman friend who doesn't mind a little play wrestling or play fight or hitting each other with pillows or somebody who wouldn't get made if I grabbed or slapped her butt out of nowhere. I also have to say please have a car and be mobile and of course please be single and if you have kids I don't have a problem with that but make sure you have time in your life before you message me. So if this sounds like something you're into please reply with (adventure) as your subject title in your response please and thank you

I'm very trustworthy, cleared a Background check with no problems last Summer. I have a FICA score of about 830. I pay all my bills on time. I'm frugal. I enjoy cooking, walking, listening, and have a fairly mild manner most of the time. I do not smoke, no drugs, and seldom drink.

I do not live in San Jose at this time. But, with Medi-Care A & B kicking in soon, I have to be near a Kaiser or I lose my medical benefits! Thus, why I'm seeking a Senior person who might enjoy sharing their house/apt.with another Senior person [me!]. I am retired and live on a modest monthly pension. I'm pretty handy and can help you around your place. I even do yard work. 

I assure you that my intentions are more for friendship/companionship/partnership* with someone my age. So, if interested, email me and then we will take it from there. Thanks..... 
*I am not looking for a free ride situation! I am willing to pay a small rent fee.

ONLY SENIOR AGED PERSONS NEED REPLY...that means YOU are 60yrs old or older!

I know that most people only browse CL for entertainment value...to see if anything can still shock their jaded sensibilities, but there are messages of genuine substance to be discovered...even here. 

I'm looking for the woman who is unhappily married but who needs to stay married for practical reasons. The woman who lacks intimacy in and out of the bedroom. What I don't want is lunch time sex. I want a woman that has the flexibility to experience life with me outside the bedroom as well. I want someone who I think about when I wake up in the morning and when I lay down at night. I want the woman who makes my heart sing when I hear her voice on my phone or get an email from her.. 

Making love is incredible when relationships are nurtured and emotional bonds are formed. I have no plans to leave the marriage that I'm in -- it's just too complicated -- but I'm not willing to live out the rest of my life unfulfilled either. 

There must be a woman who finds herself in a similar situation -- a woman who is ready to build a long-term, secondary relationship. 
Honestly, the concept of an affair seems quite easy. Two attached people make a decision to mess around and well the rest is history. However, the more complicated question is how do those two attached people make it known that they are open to such an arrangement.

About me: 

Others would typically describe me as being laid back, very funny, considerate, respectful, spontaneous and at time shy. I like sports , reading, beach/camping, independent and mainstream films, dancing, hiking, road trips, Cooking, Cricket and good restaurants ( who doesn't). But I would trade them all for a night of warmth and cuddling at home in front of a good movie and some great take out food... Care to join...(wink)


About you: 

The woman I am looking for married like me but is starved for intimacy and ready for a sensual and cerebral adventure. I am discerning and patient; this is only worth doing if it really feels right. She has darker hair and eyes...maybe olive complexion...she might be of Latin, Mediterranean, Asian, or mixed heritage. For that matter, she could be a striking brunette of any origin....the dark features are just my preference. She is fit and feminine. Her hands are soft and graceful...they fit nicely in my large grasp.

So.. Here's the situation: I'm a dude lookin for some new friends. Thing is, I've never had a problem makin friends with other guys. Girls though, that's a different story. It may be possible that I've just been introduced to the wrong ones. THOSE ""friends"" normally just wanted to hang out during parties, drink all my liquor and then they'd disappear till the next party. And they'd normally want a free ride to and from the party. Not down for that. I mean, don't get me wrong, I definitely wouldn't mind having a friend that I can drink with, in fact, I enjoy drinkin with my friends, but I'm looking for friends I can also kick it with when we're NOT drinkin.

About me: Half Hispanic, Half Filipino, I like movies, tv, music, art, video games, beer, hanging out, drivin, among other things.

You: Be awesome, like similar things, be around my age like somewhere around 20-30, live near my area.

Fun Fact: If you're a Legend of Zelda fan, we might be besties. If you dislike Legend of Zelda, we might be mortal enemies.

Anywayz, if you're lookin for a new friend, I'm here. Send me an email if you're interested. If you wanna just text first that's cool with me, but I would like to kick it eventually. I'd write more about myself, but I feel that's something that we could talk about when we kick it. Also, I didn't post a pic cause this is Craigslist and I think it's weird, but I'll send one if you want, and I'd want one in return. I mean, I would like to place a face to the person I'm talkin to.

Or you can send me a Kik: S_Flame

Hope to hear from you soon!

I have to state this but I am not looking for sex, repeat I am not looking for sex so that means no fwb situation involving sex but I am however looking for a woman friend I can flirt with. Also it is a shame that I have to state this too but I am only looking for women who were born women and women who are single and not married or in a relationship. I the type of guy who will give you attention like text you out of nowhere or have fun and funny conversations and trust me if I was in your life you would be laughing whenever you talked to me or laughing about what I said the last time you talked to me.

I am 6'2 stocky thick build brown chocolate skin brown eyes full lips deep voice facial hair big hands and feet no tattoos only my ears pierced. I don't sag my pants and I always wear a belt and I always like to smell good whenever I leave the house. I don't discriminate on anybody so I like all races of women and I don't care about age as long as you're over 18. I am trying to bring happiness to your life and I am not going to give you any money, use you or abuse you in any way, I just want you to be yourself and I just want to see that beautiful smile.

I want someone who shares the same interest. I like being out sometime going hiking chilling at the park and going out to clubs. Im also looking for someone who also likes to be a home body from time to time as well sitting around all day watching netflix or hulu and binge watching a season of some show. I love video games i have the Xbox 360 the PS4 and a wii. I also have a membership with Planet Fitness so i can bring someone with me to work out hopefully someone who will push me to get a good body by summer time lol. If you think this might be you please hit me up and please only do so if your looking for this type of friendship as well. hope to hear from people soon.

PS 

please attach a photo, i'd like to know who im talking to. 

P.P.S 
I am an accounts manager at a sushi distributor so that means free sushi as well lol

I realize this may sound like a weird post, but I have no idea where else to post it. Doesn't quite fit in casual encounters or M4W because I'm not necessarily looking to meet or establish a relationship. In any case, please bear with me and if this isn't your thing, kindly ignore it and move on.

So admittedly, I have a fetish for sheer nylon stockings and pantyhose. I don't wear them myself as that does nothing for me, but I love seeing women in them. I don't have any friends that I'm aware of that share this fetish, therefore, no one to talk to about it. Just wondering if there's a woman here on Craigslist that may share my fetish and are interested in talking about it. Again, I'm not necessarily looking to meet unless we're both compelled to do so. We can just exchange emails or chat on Kik.

If you're interested, I'd love to hear from you. Women of all ages/race/shape/size/etc are welcomed to reply! Hope everyone has an amazing day!

Hey, thanks for reading my post.
About myself, I'm a Chinese college student, 20 years old, friendly, sentimental, patient. As said in title, I'm looking for a gay friend to hang out with, cuddle with and start a friendship. Hope you're between 18 and 35, respectful and looking for just gay friends too. I don't drive so I hope you do. I take care of friends seriously so I expect long-term friendship. However, I don't want to get into relationship for now and I can assure you that's zero possibility to happen. About sex, maybe we can cuddle and I'm a fetish for sneakers, socks and feet, so it will be awesome if you're interested too, but no SM, no master&slave role play, and no anal sex. Just play around on the safe side you know. Contact me if you'd like to explore more about me and hang out with me. Let's start with a nice chat! Oh please send me a face picture of yours and I promise I'll send back mine to you immediately. Also tell me what you're looking for.
Thank you again for reading my post!

Despite all the good things in my life I am lacking a certain spark in my life. I am seeking someone in a similar situation who would enjoy meeting for coffee or a drink for conversation. I am mostly attracted to Asians. I am a white professional. I enjoy nature, bike rides, dining. I am conservative but open minded. Not religious but do have a spiritual side to me.

I've been exploring CA for years. I've been to Death Valley eleven times and I especially, love deserts and wide open spaces.

I'm a very youthful retired late middle-aged woman (I have many friends in their 40s and 50s). Road trips for me include easy hiking and exploring local towns' thrift stores and shops. I'm quite flexible about duration of trips, from day-trips, to one or two nights or longer. My biggest problem in retirement has been finding women who have the time, money and desire to hit the road without much of an agenda. 

I have a wide range of interests and I love to laugh. I don't get my knickers in a twist over much. I'm a writer and big reader.

You must be able to pull your own weight and share expenses such as gas and lodging. 

Spontaneity and a sense of humor and curiosity are absolutely essential. 

The point of road trips is to take a break from daily life so please be able to disconnect from electronica except for basic checking in with relatives and such. I don't want to find myself staring at the top of your head as you text and photograph your food.

Let's talk and meet and see if we're on the same page. The days are getting longer and I'll soon be rarin' to go. I have a brand new Kia Rio and a GPS. It's easier if you're in or near San Francisco, but not essential.

I am a married dad, and I really miss movie dates. I would love to make friends with a married mom, that has been missing the same thing.

Let's exchange a few e-mails, and if we click make plans to meet at the movies sometime soon. If we enjoy each other's company, maybe we can chat about the movie after over coffee.

Are you interested?

Anyways, I'm simply looking for a kind of woman who loves to go out, who would love to go out the pier, the beach, downtown, a bar, or wherever we go and simply have a good time and chat about what revolves around our life and everything else.

I like to text, but really I'm all about meeting up for a coffee and talk in person, like it should be anyways. A little about me would be that my name is Alexander, I'm 21, I have a job as a lyft driver, I'm single, I'm Hispanic, and the rest we could talk about it in person haha.

Hi, I'm looking for hiking partners in the bay area. I'm open to meeting either men(I'm straight) or women. I'd do the ""meetup"" thing but they're just too crowded and very casual; having a real conversation/connection is nearly impossible.

My favorite hike's are in Mill Valley but anywhere in the north bay is great for hikes. Pacifica is also full of great hikes. The hike I find to be the most grueling is Mt Diablo, especially in the summer when it's hot out. My go-to hike is San Bruno Mt, and I can usually string those trails together for 10 miles.

As for me, I'm 35, fairly athletic, an ambivert(introvert/extrovert) if I'm going to put a label on myself; I'm friendly(people actually tell me this) and outgoing, but enjoy the peace and calm of nature. I'm a great listener, great at communication, into psychology, and the human condition. I'm well traveled and can converse with pretty much anyone who speaks my language.

My best friends are married with children so they aren't available as much as I'd like them to be, and I broke up with my girlfriend 6 months ago so I'm still figuring out how to occupy that time she filled. Not heartbroken if that's what you're thinking. Let me know if you'd like to meet, thanks

Rent and cost of living is insane right now. I live and work in Benicia and looking for someone who wants to be roommates and rent a house or townhome. I have a daughter and would prefer a female. We are both quiet, clean, chill and often very busy. Don't want to move out of town because my daughter likes her school and having a 5-10 min commute is pretty awesome. All I need is someone cool and reliable to share a place with. If this interests you or you know someone please respond. 

Thanks!

Hi,

I am an educated professional male who works out at the gym several days a week to de-stress from the craziness of life and to stay healthy and fit. 

I am in search of another fit guy who works out and wants to swap an occasional massage. I have been informally trained in body work and can give a pretty good one! I am hoping to find someone else that is somewhat experienced also.

I am not looking for sex but another guy comfortable in his skin. Serious inquires only! 
I have exhausted the east bay looking for a good place to get a massage and have wound up pretty dissapointed. 

I have a massage table at home and I can do exchanges at my place or someone elses. 
If you had a table also that would be great!
Looking for a very clean, safe and courteous guy to do an exchange with. 

Please tell me a little bit about yourself, what your experience is and what you are looking for and perhaps a picture.

Thanks

I know the title sounds dramatic, but the reality is that while I'm mostly healed from my childhood sexual and physical abuse emotionally, yet I'm still at a point where I find it very hard to be intimate and connect with women in a dating context. I've had 3 short relationships in the past 10 years and been alone the rest of the time. When single, I don't date casually or ""hook up"", which means I go long periods of time without any kind of physical contact and comfort. Lately I'm really missing the emotional support it provides and because of how busy I am with some new work endeavors, I have no time to date. So if I could find a kind, generous girl to be a good friend and non-sexual cuddle buddy it would really give me something I've been sorely lacking and missing and would provide emotional/physical support as pursue my new career goals. Also, please don't judge this, but I would prefer an Asian or Indian woman simply because I've spent a lot of time in that part of the world and feel more at peace there and thus I've found a greater ability to detach from the normal associations of my past abuse in intimate/physical contact with Asian/Indian women.

I am looking for someone who is in need of a place to live (no income needed) and who will help with projects around the house, starting a garden, composting, cleaning, organizing, etc. I am currently overwhelmed with life in general and the craziness that I have surrounded myself with at this time. I need positivity around me as well as someone who can help get me motivated.

I am 31years old and not very social. I have given up on finding love and instead I am looking for a partner(s) who want to eventually homestead (and can start small today) and who have similar ideals and values. I live on a small lot in Lucerne, ca. It is not a large yard however I want to find someone to assist me in my quest for sustainability. I eventually (next two years max) will find a large acreage where I can homestead full time with all sorts of animals and crops and this person would be willing to start over with me when I buy more property.

this would be the perfect fit for someone who is nonjudgmental, positive, friendly, does't smoke or use tobacco products or drugs (although others on the property smoke cigs another would be too much for me and eventually I would like the property to be smoke free), there is alcohol consumed here although it doesn't typically get out of hand. You must love dogs (as I have many) and all living creatures/things. 

I am 420 friendly, although I don't smoke, and I am open to all kinds of individuals as well as ages (over 18) who are willing to work towards self-sufficientcy and achieving shared dreams. You have to be willing to put in a lot of effort and this is not a task for the faint of heart but your efforts will be rewarded long term.

A bit about the property and living situation:it is not a desirable situation for someone with other viable alternatives. There is often complete chaos within the group that lives in the mobile home and they will perhaps attempt to sabotage our efforts at communal living which is why someone who is generally understanding of the pressures that come from trying to escape poverty and homelessness, calm under pressure and does not react to ignorance or verbally combative conversations is a must. We are great in some ways though -we share, we care and are trying to be better as a group and individuals (some more than others)and if you are willing to put in the effort to get along with us and our craziness you will fit in and perhaps we can grow and learn with each other.

Please put homesteader in the subject line of any reply so that I know you are real and not a robot and include a bit about you, what you have going on in your life (your current situation) and your expectations as far as what you are willing and not willing to live with and anything you feel you would like to add. As a side note I will remove this posting once I find someone.

So I've been consistently going back to the gym since last December, and honestly I feel as though I've hit a wall in my progression and results. While trying to figure out why my situation has become so stale, it's come to my attention that I generally go alone to the gym, which I find too mundane and impossible to stay motivated. I'm not huge but I'd like to think I'm athletic and in shape and I genuinely enjoy working out. My hope is that I can find a like-minded individual(s) who can help keep me motivated just as I would for you. I really don't care what race you are or your body type, I'm only interested in your motivation and drive to workout. My only actual preference is that you have a 24 hour Fitness gym membership as thats where I tend to workout although I'm willing to make exceptions. If this is something that interests you, then please don't hesitate to message me.

Hi - If you are a woman, unattached, over Age 50 and like what you read below, I would like to hear from you with a little background and your personal goals. Photo is appreciated. 

A little about me: 

Relocated to the bay area from NJ/NY, in 1979. Yes, I miss the Big Apple and hope to go back and visit. 

Mild-mannered gentleman, College-Educated, non-judgmental, non-smoker, Fit/Healthy, romantic, financially & emotionally secure. I grew up travelling throughout Europe and the Middle East, because my dad was a international bank executive tasked with helping establishing bank branches, in many major cities in Europe and the middle east. I finally landed in NJ/NY area in 1970. My college and grad schooling were in upstate NY (Troy, NY).

Started my semi retirement, in early 2014.

My friends describe me as fun to be around, respectful, well-rounded, witty, calm, honest, compassionate, kind, sensitive, romantic & affectionate.. there are few more, I hope you discover'em! (Nooooooo, I am not near perfect - nor trying to be).

The outdoors, gardening, cooking, dancing, ethnic cuisine, sunsets, music, the theatre, classic movies, travel, moonlights.... & Life are among the things I enjoy.

I am fluent in French (the language).

I am not deterred by body type, religion, skin color or ethnicity so long we connect comfortably and harmoniously. I have a catholic background, but I am not fanatic about it. Among other components, I find Balance, Kindness, Sanity & Harmony are essential in Life.

My taste in music gravitates around Jazz, Classic Rock, World music... 

I prefer a romantic candlelight dinner with music, by the fireplace, to watching TV.

Meanwhile, Happy Holidays!

Don't know why I'm posting as I know I won't get a response but here's to trying.

So I don't have much friends, not really anyone close to talk to. Although I'm in a committed relationship, I feel an empty void which ceases any motivation to do anything new. Am I just settling? 

I wish I can find a nice pen pal or even good female friend. A best friend. A gym partner to motivate health, A geeky girl for gaming entertainment, a realist to converse with. Share stories, share opinions, and most of all a guide to life. 

I don't know what I'm doing but I'm letting life respond...

I've tried other places, and dating websites to find new friends. But things never work out as they are either interested in dating, or don't believe when I say I'm looking for a friend.

Also if you're interested in chatting or miss the old instant messaging days. Message me on kik oxy1984.

Life's meant to be lived but recently I feel like its become a monotonous one way street. I am in a loving relationship but its become a relationship filled with chores and things to finish. I have also realized that I don't have any friends who are women; just the guy friends to go watch football or drink beer on a random weekend. 

I am hoping against hope that maybe on CL I can find a woman also in a similar predicament. Don't you wish someone would send you fun messages while at work? Yes! Do you dream about the excitement of seeing a flirty email describing things we could do sometime? I do! 

Me: mid 30s, attached, hwp, love movies, hiking, swimming, am a total foodie. 

You: 30s to 40s, also attached (so we can relate)

Hi, 

Shall we?


And yes I'm married as well as you should be if you are reading this...but in need and search of more since i cant really change my current situations.... I guess I would like to find someone with the same needs

I'm not alone I bet... Life is way too short to keep loosing time as we are getting older everyday...

shall we?

We can find ourselves in situations that seemingly have no end. My wife has become more of a roommate than anything else. Circumstances that I will not go into here prevent me from leaving. Been together for a long time and now we just pass each other in the night. There are stupid arguments, stupid fights, no ugly but dormant. It's impossible to talk. Who would understand? Who would even believe? After all, we're the 'Perfect Couple'. We are what everyone envision as the 'perfect' marriage.

I am looking for a confident, friends with benefits, or anything with passion. I want companionship, friendship, communication, mutual respect, trust and caring. I'm looking for someone, preferably married, who may be in a similar situation and looking for a little something more in their life.

Let's be each others friend, companion, confidant and possibly lovers if it goes that far. Communication is key with me. I like to exchange cute emails and chats during the day. It's simply a lot of fun because I'm a also romantic at heart. I'm not looking to be your new husband nor am I looking for you to be my new wife. When we can, we'll steal moments away with each other.

I'm an educated hard working professional, funny, discreet, humorous, caring, polite, respectful, laid back person that knows how to treat a lady as a lady. 
body : average height : 5-10

age: 45

Imagine the possibilities...

You are in a marriage or long term situation that has lost something. . . that special connection that brought you into the marriage in the first place. You have tried so hard to connect with your spouse yet you realize you are the one doing all of the work. The intimacy is gone s you stay because of family obligations, a financial situation or because that is what you do. . ..

You are looking for someone to share your thoughts and desires of the day with -- someone who is open, honest and willing to have a real conversation - someone who will look forward to your IM or emails. Someone who can provide a special connection only two people can understand.

We will take the time to really get to know each other through conversation. We would care for each other - we might even find that we crave each other in every way possible. We won't be rushed and we won't settle and we hate hook ups. Right now we just need each other because want and need a positive relationship in our lives.

This can only happen if we find each other.

I am not looking to change your situation or mine. I would prefer to speak via email, IM or chat first to get to know each other. If there is a connection then I am open to possibly meeting.

Please be between the ages of 35-50, live within 30 to 45 minutes of Bay area, easy going (with a sexy personality), decent shape as I workout regularly. I am mostly open to most nationalities as long as they are respectful however I'm most attractted light complesure
ladies!!!

I am a married male in my 40's. I am a professional who loves indoors and outdoor activities. I enjoy laughing and having an honest conversation. I am not into judging others and I preferred not to be judge. I am a strong man with an easygoing personality, non-smoker, not into drugs, light drinker, and disease free. I prefer someone similar.

Hello! I'm a professional photographer of over ten years, shooting mostly abandoned locations such as hospitals, jails, military facilities, railways, desert landscapes, forest resorts, and historic buildings throughout California. I've also been working with models (pro and amateur) for portraits, film set previews, and storyboard projects for several years now as well.

I'm looking for a female model who can pose nude or semi-nude for my current photography project titled ""Urban Decay: Hidden Beauty Within"".

**Please Note: This is NOT an erotic project. Any/all offers will be reported and deleted immediately.**

Processed originals will be available to you at no cost (free) in exchange for your time and use. -- Great for amateurs or new models who want to build their portfolios!!

The locations I will be shooting the project in are:
- San Jose
- Morgan Hill
- Gilroy
- Saratoga
- Santa Cruz Mountains
- Seaside
- Monterey
- Treasure Island
- SF Presidio
- Marin Headlands

The majority of the shots will be in daylight, but if agreed upon, may include some nighttime moonlit exposure shoots as well (weather-dependant). -- **If you are interested and able to travel outside the bay area, I also shoot on filmset locations throughout the Mojave Preserve several times a year.

All areas where we shoot are always safe and secure, and none are within the public eye to maintain respect and privacy. You (the model) are welcome to bring a friend to the photoshoot as long as the friend does not interfere with the model or disrupt the photographer during the photoshoot.

I'm specifically looking for models with the following traits:
- Age: 18-45
- Build: skinny, thin, average
- Cup Size: A-C
- Skin Tone: light, pale, white
- Tattoos: None, some okay
- Piercings: None, some, alot, more
- Body Mods: None

We will meet for a basic interview and discussion of the project first before visiting the locations for the photo shoot. Your own transportation is required unless prior arrangements are made.

All potential models will need to sign a Model Release Form before starting work. This form is basically a written agreement stating that I have permission to photograph you and to use your image in my photography works.

Any questions or discuss the project, please ask! Please also send one head shot and one full-body shot for consideration (no erotic or porn photos please).

Hope to hear from you soon! -- Have a great day!

I'm a polite, respectful, fit, and handsome male who is looking for a group of women who might want to bring a unique twist into their book club. What I propose is that I attend your next get-together as your nude helper/server for the event. I would serve the food and drinks, take care of any chores you had for me, and do whatever I could to make the event a nice one. But I'd be in my birthday suit.

I know this whole idea is crazy, but the fact is that I love women and think they should all have a nude guy to cater to them. Even though this concept sounds outlandish, I promise that I'm a completely respectful and kind guy. 

I'm pretty smart too, so I'd be happy to participate in the discussion - or to keep quiet and just be seen but not heard. That'd be up to you women. 

Please let me know if you're interested and if you have any questions. I'm especially interested in meeting up with a group of older women. Show the kids and grandkids that you're still capable of some outside-the-box and surprising fun!!!

Just kidding! I was just trying to get your attention.

Seriously though I'm posting in the strictly platonic section because I'm looking for a pen pal. I'm not looking for someone to meet and hang out with right now because I keep a very busy schedule that limits my free time. However I do miss just talking to someone about random things.

I'm looking for other Lesbians (born female like myself) who are in a relationship or married and have no extra time to hang out. So having a pen pal is ideal for you because of your busy schedule.

Nothing about this ad is code for sex or dating. I am ugly, fat, have horrible skin and am happily taken :)

Some things that I'm into are taking trips to explore new places, trying new restaurants, watching sports, being outdoors as much as I can, listening to a lot of music, joking and laughing as much as possible, arts and crafts, concerts, sticking to a workout schedule, organic foods, cooking, and animal advocacy.

I do not smoke anything. I don't drink alcohol or soda.

If you want to write then please do otherwise good luck and happy searching.

So.. Here's the situation: I'm a dude lookin for some new friends. Thing is, I've never had a problem makin friends with other guys. Girls though, that's a different story. It may be possible that I've just been introduced to the wrong ones. THOSE ""friends"" normally just wanted to hang out during parties, drink all my liquor and then they'd disappear till the next party. And they'd normally want a free ride to and from the party. Not down for that. I mean, don't get me wrong, I definitely wouldn't mind having a friend that I can drink with, in fact, I enjoy drinkin with my friends, but I'm looking for friends I can also kick it with when we're NOT drinkin.

About me: Half Hispanic, Half Filipino, I like movies, tv, music, art, video games, beer, hanging out, drivin, among other things.

You: Be awesome, like similar things, be around my age like somewhere around 20-30, live near my area.

Fun Fact: If you're a Legend of Zelda fan, we might be besties. If you dislike Legend of Zelda, we might be mortal enemies.

Anywayz, if you're lookin for a new friend, I'm here. Send me an email if you're interested. If you wanna just text first that's cool with me, but I would like to kick it eventually. I'd write more about myself, but I feel that's something that we could talk about when we kick it. Also, I didn't post a pic cause this is Craigslist and I think it's weird, but I'll send one if you want, and I'd want one in return. I mean, I would like to place a face to the person I'm talkin to.

Or you can send me a Kik: S_Flame

LOOKING FOR NEW FRIENDS in the Northbay. I just moved to Santa Rosa from the Eastbay-- If this all resonates with you, please write me. Blessings to all to find the friends that are best for you.

I'd love to meet people that deeply mirror enough of my path and stages of growth so we can easily understand each other, feel compassion and provide support for each other. I'm new to the SF Northbay, I have a couple friends in the Eastbay but would like friends here to share my life stories and growth and listen to your life stories and growth. I'm looking for someone similar to me---already on a spiritual heart path. I'm a regular type person yet born heart-evolved, young at heart, a Lightworker, age 60, attractive, about to begin another part of my journey, the main portion of my Divine Life Purpose work. Desire someone to share life experiences, ups and downs, on our ongoing growth paths, with compassionate healing focuses on all levels-- mental emotional physical spiritual financial but mostly like to keep things simple, and focused on the heart, with deep self compassion and compassion for others. 

I am currently preparing to do a variety of work to create a financial foundation, dogwalking, groceryshopping, while I prepare to become an Angel Therapist (helping others connect to their Angels for healing all parts of their life). I do embrace basic spiritual laws like Ask & you will receive, and pay attention to your own beliefs to find blockages to receiving,etc but I mostly keep a grounded and honest focus, although I am basically an optimist with faith I also have a simple discerning tool that regularly sees red flags in myself and life so I can help heal or release things. Also I use basic humanistic psychology to see relationship dynamics needing to be healed in the world, with others and within oneself, often originating from one's childhood family issues, etc. My view of the world is that we are all blessed by the Divine and all have access to the Divine, and we all are receiving Divine assistance to bring thru healing for humanity and the earth, one person at a time, based on freewill choices. 

I'm also aware of the Sonoma State University archives of Project Censored, and the corporate greed going on. But mostly I just like to focus on creating a simple, grounded, compassionate life for myself and close friends. And would love to have someone to go with to the park and the river, and maybe some other event we could enjoy together. I'm becoming a vegetarian soon, and I'm trying to get in shape by simple stretching, but don't do any intense strenuous activity, although I used to dance and will be doing so again. 

I am a basically compassionate person and don't harm others, and need a friend who is similar, I am not judgemental but I am getting very clear about what type of support is nourishing for me. I need a little head but a lot of heart too. I'm not very emotional exactly, but I can be passionate about social justice issues, and when my heart is open I can cry in empathy with tears. Looking for a friend in the same ballpark, so we can support each other, but also have access to our own intuitive guidance and listen to our own inner wisdom and bodywisdom. So we don't need to do much of anything but be compassionate witnesses for each other, and just both of us share and both of us listen. I'm planning on following Christiane Northrup book, Goddesses Never Age. 

Although I've been on a spiritual path, my childhood background has been to come from a more traditional background, so I had to work hard to release beliefs that interfered with my desired process, so in that way my orientation still reflects a much more grounded approach to all my work, simple, kind, loving, open, transparent, is how I approach the work and myself, so I still sometimes struggle as I'm creating a solid and fully self-loving perspective that will be perfect for me, healthy and grounded. I believe that many teachers don't realize how much they use anti-human language that disconnects them from their own feelings, authentic process, and natural comfort zone and body wisdom. I like to keep my path, my work, and my perspectives very simple and very grounded and very human oriented. If this all resonates with you simply and deeply, please write me. Looking forward to meeting you.

Hey there!

Are you also involved with someone, who at one time may have been exciting but no longer is? Not just sexually (though that may be a big deal for you), but emotionally? Have you drifted apart, yet stay together for your own reasons? Would you like to commiserate sometime over coffee? I'm buying! 

But seriously, I'm a handsome (maybe I'm bias), tall, average-built, also involved, 40-something, looking for a similar ""ear"" to share stories and even secrets with. I'm witty, intelligent, very cordial and considerate, love probing questions, and enjoy deep conversations -- especially the most controversial subjects.

I have no bounds, but my objective is NOT to have sex with you (unless of course we absolutely have to). Intimacy is a very interesting thing and can only truly be enjoyed when an emotional connection is made. Let's just leave that part out (for now) and see what happens . . . 

PS ... I won't hold you responsible for not liking me, physically or otherwise. We are complex creatures and like what we like. The end. :) 

Please say hello! 

I am 100% real and serious. You should be, too. And bots/prostitutes: DO NOT ask me to ""verify"" myself on your ""free"" site. I've not raped or killed anyone, nor have I thought about raping or killing anyone - ever, but thank you for your efforts. ;)

And neither should you. The sanctity of marriage is something we've created in our minds to address what seems to be a state of disorder. Some of you know this to be true and giggle about it as you browse these personals with your ""Bestie"". 

But you return to the vicious circle, a sucker for punishment. A life of servitude with little focus on the best things in life. A constant battle to silence your intuition. 

Oh, I can almost feel some of you begin to extend your claws, poised for attack. But I'm impervious! A layer of thick skin and a suit of chain mail and fresh filters installed. I speak not to the woman reading this but her innermost ""questionable"" desires. 

I won't sit here and dictate the sort of arrangement or relationship I'm looking for. It's far too dynamic. If you are a bitch, we will feed off of that and address it aggressively. If you are sweet and submissive, we will take things slowly and enjoy terms of mutual respect. If you are lonely and in need of attention, prepare to feel wholesome but don't expect a one way street. 

So get busy! Quit spending your morning coffee browsing ads and write something meaningful instead!

Cheers,

X.

Hello there, 

I have been married for many years and have a son. I love him deeply and could not possibly imagine separating from him. On the other hand, there are important elements that are missing in my marriage, such as the company, support, and love of my partner which has been missing since the very beginning. According to my wife, we are not compatible and it hurts me deeply. 

I don't like the idea to be separated from my kiddo, but at the same time I have some very serious needs. I love to talk and share my time with someone special. If you are in similar situation please let's talk. I am not looking for quick hookups. . ...just the idea of a good friendship with the purpose that perhaps someday it can evolve emotionally and physically later on. I am well groomed and handsome looking guy. 

I work full time and have graduate degree in engineering. Please let me know if you are in the similar situation and want to build a bond of friendship to start with.

I wished I could find some decent friends I feel like people don't like me I'm really a good person the people I work with always exclude me out . I'm never invited to join in unless they include everyone. They have their own click well it would be nice if I can find my own click and have fun hanging out doing things with females like getting pedicure nails hair done shopping maybe even going out to drink or getting out dressing up I have a lot of dressy clothes but no where nice to go. No parties or anything fun. Anyway I know I probably sound like a whiner but I'm just trying to find some female friends I can't make friends on Facebook although I have over 750 people I don't know locals on my Facebook. Well if you want to make a cool friend let me know

Your new Egalitarian friend is fun educated mensch, a refined omnivore cook with hedonistic health oriented tendencies whom you will need to guard away from all your men-hungry girl friends.

Super chill, adventurous, loud, funny, 420 friendly girl looking to make some good friends.
I get along best with other Libras & Gemini's but can usually vibe with everyone who I cross paths
with. I love dirtbikes, dogs, bars, clubs, hiking, beaches, horses, camping, coffee, hanging out
at the lake, all music and a bunch of other random stuff. I live on the peninsula but venture into SF &
the south bay often.

Looking for other chill girls or guys who are down for some bar crawls, beer pong, random adventures,
concerts and whatever else we can come up with. I don't do well with shy or awkward people as it tends to make me a little shy and awkward (I'm usually neither of those things).

Just to get this out of the way - I've been with a women for the last 9 years but don't identify as a lesbian, I just like who I like, gender doesn't really come into play for me. I don't care how you do or don't identify but you should absolutely be OK with who I am.

I can drive or even pick you up, i'll pay for the evening and one thing I do ask is that you send a pic please before we meet. I can send a pic to your email.

Thank you very much!!

Minding your own damn business, you wander into Safeway. Maybe it was for some toilet paper? Frozen fish filets? Maybe some bagged salad? The cashier hands you a sealed green monopoly piece. You think, ""the hell am I going to do with this?"" But you feel the urge to accept it and smile. You fight your way through the parking lot where grandma is parked just a little too close to you, your gas light came on, and you're tired because Frank who lives next door was riding the pound town express all night (wait? was he calling out my name?). Green monopoly still in your grasp, you throw it on the passenger seat of your car, wasted like your prom night, never to be thought of again. 

Over and over this happens. Pretty soon you have so many of those godforsaken green monopoly pieces!! They're everywhere. After a while you finally open one up, my guess- a fucking paper cut!! ""Ain't that some bull shit!!"" You vow to rid these annoying green monopoly pieces. 

That's where I come in. I'm old, boring and totally get a lady boner collecting these things. If you're wanting good karma, and to totally help me get my rocks off. Send me your unopened green monopoly pieces.

I'm a desi man who works close to Grt Mall. I do visit there once in a while, either to just roam around, walk and window shop, or sometimes eat in food court when I'm alone. It is good to take break from work and stretch yourself.

However, it would be even better if I could meet someone who also visits Grt Mall, preferably another Indian woman! I've had many men friends, its time to gel with a woman. I am a good conversationalist, erudite, refined, classy and well traveled and well read. I would love to find an Indian woman who is bored during daytimes and visit Grt Mall, and also looking for a friend herself. 

We can have lunch together, take a walk together, get coffee, gel etc! We can be friends. Time pass during work day. Like an hour or two. Just unwind! I am seeking a daytime companionship and you too! You may be single or married doesn't matter. I'm married myself and my personal life has gone stale and I need a new friend. Your life needs a friend and distraction too. 

After some time, we can go together and window shop at either Coach or VS (you know what it is) or any other store. I might even think of spending for my lady friend.......

Why don't we connect? No harm right?

In good shape, 40, handsome, light skinned, easy going, short but full head of hair. Smell good and clean. Am a charmer!

I am a clean, DDF, fit/trim, healthy, married Indian man and very adventurous.....

I have found myself in a very unique situation. I have a lovely family and friends, but due to recent events in my life that have me feeling a bit unsettled and out sorts. I find that I am seeking a different type of support that my friends and family can not give me. I am single and at this time in my life and really wish I was not, but I am also not wanting to put forth the efforts to change that status, quite yet. But, I do realize I really need to find a man that can hold me and cuddle with me. I do not want sex!!! Please know that I am not seeking a hook up or sex!!! I just want to be held and cuddle.

I am attractive, tall and curvy/thick build. I am just mentioning what I look like, because there is nothing wrong with my appearance, I am just single, which for a 48 year old woman, can carry such a stigma in today's world. :( 

I am not super hung up on your appearance, but smelling good and good hygiene is a major plus!! I would really also like you to be single, cause I am sure, your wife or girlfriend would not appreciate you snuggling with an attractive, single lady. Please be employed and able to drive to my home and have a car! I have no clue if this will get any responses. But, CL seems to be the place to post unusual topics.

Please drop me a line if interested and we can start with chatting and go from there.

I am hoping to meet an attached lady with whom I can fall into conversation about anything and everything and the meaning of it all.

You know, the kind of conversations that can only be really held with a stranger.

You may ask: ""Couldn't you have these conversations with your spouse?"" Well, if you've been married for a while you already know that while we all need to talk about metaphysics, those who know us well want details and specifics, while strangers allow us to operate more vaguely on a cosmic scale....

When the talk occurs between two people that don't know each other, it gathers a special charge. After all, you can only say ""I feel like I've known you for years"" to someone you have *not* known for years :)

Funny how your spouse doesn't understand the bittersweet transience of life as well as a stranger encountered in a hotel bar or here on craigslist....

I'm looking for ways to promote my work, either in the form of capital donations, ideas and contacts, or even a collaboration with an established designer, so that I can finally bring my jewelry designs to a wider audience of customers.

I think I'm trying to mobilize any combination of the above into a public relations/advertising campaign, but I'm not sure how to go about it, who to trust or how to pay for it. 

In the past, I've had the opportunity to appear on a popular Washington D.C. morning show, promoting a past product, I've donated gift items to high profile charity events for auction/goody bags and have had my jewelry featured in several stores/galleries. I seem to have established a reputation as a very personable and dynamic spokesperson (they sell more when I'm there). In fact, it's been hard to tell where admiration for my jewelry line begins and appreciation of me ends. (please understand that this is not bragging for bragging sake; it has been a challenge to tell if they really like the jewelry, or me wearing the jewelry, more ... ) I'm approached at least 10 times a day, in random encounters, and complimented on any of my jewelry pieces that I make and wear. However, I need to find a way to translate that to actual sales. 

Any ideas or thoughts would be deeply valued.
Thank you!

Thanks for reading my ad and I am glad I caught your attention. I went back and forth with how I ought to title this ad and finally landed on advertising for a ""special discreet friendship."" This is my first foray into the world of seeking such a friendship since being married. I am simply interested in making my life a little more exciting, giving it an extra kick, having some intrigue. While I am still very much attached to my wife, the passion has somehow slipped away and my relationship has dulled over time. It is very comfortable, but not exciting. Do you feel that way? It may be that you and I just email each other some spicy titillating (although respectful) emails; it may be that we decide to discreetly meet and chat over coffee/tea, or maybe explore things further if we are both mutually inclined. There are lots of possibilities. As far as I am concerned, we can't go wrong...

I am a Caucasian man, tall, attractive, stocky, gym-goer, early fifties, advanced degrees, professional, live and work in San Francisco, clean-cut, respectful, and very discreet. I would love to hear from women -- married or single between the ages of 25 and 60 -- who, for whatever reasons, want to engage in a friendship in which all limits are respected yet at the same time exploration is in the cards (whether that be through e-mails, meet ups, etc.). I am honestly very open about how all of this might unfold. In the end, I do not wish to negatively impact my marriage and I don't want you (or your spouse/partner) hurt in any way; this is a very important value I hold dear and to which I am committed. 

I hope you are further intrigued by reading my ad and I hope to hear from you. I will reply to all who respond to my ad. Please tell me a bit about yourself (age, description, and any information about yourself that you would like to share) and what compelled you to answer my ad. What is your situation at the moment? What would you hope for out of a special friendship like this? I'll promise to get in touch with you soon.

I very much look forward to hearing from you... To know for sure that your email is not coming from a (ro)bot, please put the name of your favorite city in the subject line of your email. Thanks again and I hope to hear from you.

Hello,

I am an avid outdoors person and a safe, experienced climber. Unfortunately, my regular climbing partners have all moved away one by one due to the economy and other reasons. I have not climbed regularly in a while but wish to begin climbing seriously again. I prefer to climb outdoors and intend to get outside as much as possible as the weather permits but will happily climb in a gym when outside is not an option. I would prefer to link up with a female climbing partner for the time being. I've climbed with many people over the years and I just prefer to focus on the climbing now and not the egos and competitiveness that male climbers typically bring with them. I have taught many first timers from boy scout troops to friends of friends so don't be afraid to respond, all skill levels welcome.

Hi guys, girls or small groups of friends. I need help experiencing a new fantasy I want to try. After being wrapped in a base of plastic wrap (Saran wrap), I want to be wrapped, head to toe, like a mummy, in duct tape. 

I found videos, on the internet, of people being mummified in duct tape. I found it extremely exciting, and I want it to be done to me. Obviously, I cannot do it myself. So, I need willing volunteers who would have fun wrapping me up in duct tape. 



I read blogs, online, by people who practice total mummification by duct tape regularly. They say it is like getting a ""HIGH"" without using drugs. Being wrapped tightly, and the total sensory deprivation (ear plugs inserted, blindfolds, etc) can give a sense of total euphoria.

I am not wacko or crazy. I am a nice, easy going, fun guy who found a new interest.

OK, here are the conditions:
I am married, you would have to host me. My wife is not into bondage.
We would have to meet and talk first to establish a mutual trust.
You would wrap me exactly as I want to be wrapped.
You would unwrap me at the end of the bondage session.
I will supply all materials needed for the procedure.

I HOPE SOMEONE WILL HELP ME ""WRAP THIS UP"" VERY SOON.

Hola everyone!

I'm an avid anime fan and I'm in the area of berkeley this week

I am planning to rent out a hotel room for the sake of holding an all day anime party with one person and me where we'd be down to watch anime, play board games, discuss and critique animes, and endulge in the free room service drinks that the hotel I book offers (they only offer free room service to rooms with two people or less)... So free drinks!

Animes I have on deck are :Digimon Tamers, Kill la Kill, Summer Wars. Clannad, Gate, No game no life, or whatever you'd recommend

You can also bring one friend over too so as long as they're an anime fan or love board gaming

Let's hang out and no worries you don't have to pay for the hotel room I'm booking I get a HUGE discount on it and it's so cheap anyway

You can help contribute to this party if you like, just propose it in the email, you can text me too!

I'm sure it's a total CL pipe dream, but I thought I would rattle off a wish list for an email/IM partner. She would be:

-- Age 30-50
-- Educated (bachelor's degree or above)
-- Too much of a grammar/literacy nerd to engage in a lot of abbreviating
-- Somewhat brainy (interested in books, current events, art, etc.)
-- At least minimally interested in sports (playing and watching)
-- Flirty, but in a mature, compelling way
-- Level-headed and non-stalkery
-- Interested in periodic emailing throughout the day

Bonus points for the following:

-- Love NPR
-- Enjoy coffee/tea

If this sounds even remotely like you, I'd enjoy a response!

I have been experiencing the desire to help those in need. Especially those who have been mentally ill and depressed. 

I've been mentally depressed and have battled against it since childhood. I know it comes with a feeling of emptiness and accompanied by the feeling of loneliness. If there was a map to mental depression, I couldn't find it. At times, I didn't even realize how I got to that point that was so low. I was lost and often unable to find the words to describe such a horrible place. It had to have been a place because I often stayed there until I was ready to come out.

Many times I would slip into depression after I was hurt and unable to continue fighting. I had no energy to sustain where I was at or where I was headed. My life became the reflection of my inside. I often worked 45+ hours a week, (plus commute), didn't cook for myself and often times dated people who could not receive or give love. (Objective view)

I think at my lowest point I had a short stay at a mental faculty where the only thing I'd allow myself to think was being present because death seemed more friendlier than this interior pain.

Still I chugged along, in and out of therapy. I think after one of my last dating fiasco I decided to do something simple and look for friendship. There is was online, on Craigslist and I posted a simple ad. I had a few replies, but this one raised my eyebrow.

This man had replied and said that I had contradicted myself in my ad. He said that in my words and my ads I was looking for truthful friendships and relationships but I had a too much makeup on and that my expression was an expression for the camera and not actual life.

Long story short he helped show me my own truth. It was not a conventional friendship, but it was a very life lesson friendship. He was me in the past. (Our birthdays were exactly 41 years)

Everyday I still learning about spirit. As my mind continues to think.

If you can understand any of this message, I may be able to help you. I think a lot of us don't know spirit and our mind can play many tricks on us. I would like to show you of you, you are in individual. You are made of two. Indivisible duo=individual. If you would like I can share with you my knowledge of the language and some of the 'secrets' it holds for us. Although the words do not have secrets it is our perception of the word that will make us overlook the obviousness of its definition. 

I hope if I can't help you, you will find your way!

I'm Jake, a 23 year old aspiring writer just looking to meet unconventional people. I don't feel like I fit in well with ""south bay"" culture, and I can't afford to move to anywhere else, so I was hoping to find some like minded people around me. I have a girlfriend in Berkeley but I don't get to be up there all the time so I'd like cool people to hang out with down here.

I'm white, 6'4'', had some college under my belt and a shit-ton of schooling in hard knocks. I'm not much into drinking, drugs, clubbing, cars or whatnot which seems like the majority of southbay folks. I'm an introvert, so sometimes I'm lower energy than I have reason to be, but for the right people I'd do anything to hang out!

Likes: I like hiking, going to write at coffee shops (I'm working on a few scripts, and a book right now, a pipedream I know but I just want to try it out) free music, well written fun movies, people watching, pickup soccer or football, and people who are easy to talk to.

Dislikes: Shallowness, feeling in the way, large crowds, one-sided conversations, ""we should hang out sometime in the vague and distant future"", feeling the center of attention.

If you want to hang out in a park, coffee shop, walking downtown, poolhall or anywhere else you can think of great! Put your hang-out idea in the subject line, or just the color of your eyes so I know you're real.

Hi there,

Want to talk? Want me to listen?

My name is Annette, and I offer free on-line counseling for those in need. I am not licensed but I do have a practitioner's certificate in Solution Focused Brief Therapy. I also have over 14 years of experience helping families come up with solutions to a number of various domestic concerns. 

I can offer an empathetic listening ear, and help brainstorm solutions if you like. Why am I offering free help? Well, first off I really care about people. Second, I would love to have the opportunity to help find realistic solutions for your concerns and problems at hand. I have a couple slots of time available in between my regular work and other projects. I would be honored to help share that time helping you. My goal is to bring peace into this world. Each of us can truly leave a positive imprint here on this planet. We can create a beautiful and peaceful ""new earth"" one healed soul at a time. 

This is all done primarily via email. On occasion over the phone depending on my daily schedule and availability. Weekends are usually best. 


Topics:
-relationships
-anxiety relief
-depression
-obsessive thinking
-purpose in life
-loneliness

Please reply via email and if you care to talk and I will respond as soon as I am able. 90 percent of the time within a few minutes/hours. Take care and hope to talk with you soon. 

All the best,
Annette

Hi,

I will be taking the California Bar next week, and hoping to wind down. My idea of winding down is to go out and dine somewhere in the Bay Area. While I may end up doing this alone, it would be nice to have an eating buddy for conversation. I can do the driving. You may be male or female--no romantic interests please.

My topics of interest:
* Universe (black holes, gravitational waves, universe expansion, etc.)
* Anime (Garo, Assassination Classroom, etc.)
* Countries (familiar with Japan and Taiwan)
* Business, politics (data privacy, current events)
* Computer games (will purchase it if I don't have it and it piques my interest)
* Movies (see above)
* Religion (I enjoy listening to beliefs from other perspectives)

If this sounds enticing, feel free to message me. Thanks!

Me 51, originally from England, recently relocated to the bay area from NY. Happily divorced and single. I work a lot and am careful not to let it define who I am but working that much makes it difficult to meet new people. Fit, fun, very intact if slightly warped sense of humor. Big positive appetite for life. 

Happy to share pics, talk on the phone and am open to meeting if it feels right.

Come On, Let's Go To A Movie

Beautiful night to get out of the house and meet a new friend.
Sooo, ...does a cup of coffee and a good movie sound like a good idea for the night, ??? ,...WELL,

Lets Go See One

So what do ya think? Any nice lady out there looking for a movie partner and or ,...even better, ...a new friend? :)~

And Hey,... this might just be a good excuse for two nice, decent human beings to say hello, ...and possibly even get acquainted, ....God forbid :)~


SO YES, This is as much about good company as it is a movie. 
Hell, probably even more about ""company"" depending on how things go.


So that's it, no need to sign on the dotted line, I won't ask for a bank account number, I don't need your credit card, I don't necessarily want or need your first born. ;)
Just a movie or a cup of coffee, Or maybe the grand slam,... Coffee, Conversation AND a Movie. Hhaaaaa, You thought I was gonna say something else. 😇

Joe



PS: Oh, and I never, ever, (EVER) thought I would have to say this, but a while ago a craigslist date got in my car and I knew she smelled of BO long before she was even fully in my car. I almost gagged. My Bad!!! I agreed to meet her w/out a picture and she lied about everything and totally ""catfished"" me!
Please be showered, clean, and an advocate of good hygiene.
If you are into perfume or yummy smelling women care products, that's a plus!!!
I do love, ""The Scent of a Woman.""

So long as it's not trying to cover BO, ...Ooooyyyy Veeeeyy!!!!


Also,...not a necessity, but if you don't mind could you please send a pic of yourself, as I have posted numerous of myself.  :)

Hello,

I'm bookish, a reader and thinker. I write stuff but not in an ego-driven, look-at-me way. I typically come across as quiet. I'm more frequently a pedestrian than a driver, go to libraries more often than bookstores. But I'm not seeking someone identical to myself.

""Ditch vision"" is apparently a term coined by an obscure poet (Jeremy Hooker) to refer to the predisposition to seek the miraculous and wondrous in small, mundane things. I identify with that. I guess I'm a practitioner of what you might call ""the new parochialism,"" seeking transcendence (to be transported) here at home, by what's local and specific -- within arm's reach or walking distance.

Anyway, I enjoy walking (wandering on foot), poetic reverie, philosophizing, reading out loud, and so forth. I also enjoy throwing a frisbee in a peaceful way; tennis too, possibly, though honestly it's been a while. And I run (jog) to keep fit.

If you enjoy any of the above, feel free to send me a message. Thanks.

Greetings ..... this ""old fart"" (white male, 58 years young), is seeking a sensual lady, for just an ""old fashion"" kind of ""make out session"" ..... the kind where sensual kissing and foreplay and touching ""might"" get me to ""first base"". I'm missing investing time of the playfulness with a lady, that use to happen when a boy and a girl went to the drive-in theater, and not caring what moving was playing, because ""she"" was the lead role. If any lady understands the kind of sensual playfulness that I'm seeking, please get back to me, so we can start sharing a journey together by sharing good conversation, along with some wonderful and sensual time together. Again, I'm not looking for ""sex"" (but, if one day in the future, we end up ""making love"" to each other, that's another story), but just the sensual encounter and all the wonderful feelings of sharing a fun ""make out session"" together.

Please be real and sincere (as there are too many fakes out here). If you really want to meet up, then be prepared to name me a location of a Starbucks (or other coffee house) where we can meet up in public, in a safe environment, in person (those who direct me to a web site, and meet up there . . ... SHALL BE IGNORED . . . as that is not meeting up in person). Also, since fake spammers and ""bots"" can never seem to name a location of a Starbucks (or other coffee house) where we can meet up, it's a way to week out the fake responses. And if you want ""age verification"", again, be mature enough to meet up in person, and you shall see that I'm not a 14/15 year old teenager. And if you're too scared to meet up in public, then don't even waste your time (and my time) by responding.

Lastly, I only respond to those who respond via simple e-mail notifications. If you respond via ""Google-Plus"", I will ignore those. Also, once you provide me with an e-mail address (such as a ""yahoo.com"", or ""gmail.com"" address), I will send even more photos . . . and remember, you can always make a new e-mail address for just you and me. Lastly, respond back to from the e-mail address where you want me to reply back to. If you say, ""write back to me at another address"", why don't you sign onto that address initially to reply to me . . . I'm not going to waste my time responding back to a new e-mail address each time you send me an e-mail.

SO . . . looking forward to hearing back from a mature lady, who is ready to share a sensual journey together, and I will respond back only to such a mature lady, who is ready to start sharing such a journey, by initially meeting up in public, at a Starbucks, or other coffee house

Just contact me so we can get to know each other. Eventually I'd like to exchange kiks or numbers.

Looking to meet a lady who would like a shopping buddy when buying heels. Either you buying or me buying. I've bought a few through the years, and I'm curious to see if there are ladies out there open minded in the idea of guys liking to wear heels as well. I have an idea of styles that I like as well.

I am straight. I'm not a CD to the extent that I would fully dress and do the make up, as I mainly like trying on heels and hosiery. It's not something I practice daily, moreso when I have an itch to wear. Whomever I meet, I would like to know that I have that confidence in telling a lady (who may be relationship potential) that I like wearing heels (and hosiery). But the idea that there is a lady who is open minded and understanding would be great. A plus is having the same shoe size (7.5).

If you're 25-35 and this piques your interest, drop me a line, and add your shoe size in the subject.

Thank you.

If you're a married man (or once were) or if you're in a long-term relationship with a woman and you'd like a discreet place to discuss your sexuality and form genuine friendships with similar men, please check out the ""Married/Once Married Men's Group"" that meets weekly at the Pacific Center in Berkeley. It's the only group of its type that meets in the Bay Area.

Although the group is primarily platonic, there have been times in the past when a long-term romance has developed between two members.

One thing the group is NOT is a place to find hook-up partners.

The group is anonymous and the confidentiality of all participants is protected. Current ""regulars"" range in age from 28 - 68 and the average number of attendees each week is nine. Meetings are every Wednesday night, from 8pm - 9:50pm. The Pacific Center is located at 2712 Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley.

I started attending more than three years ago when I was looking for feedback on coming out to my teenage kids. I didn't expect to attend more than once, but because the guys' feedback was so helpful, I returned to tell them how it went. I've been hooked ever since. I've found my tribe - there's no other social group like it. The dynamic is neither straight nor gay, it's somewhere in between.

I'm posting this information, not because the group needs more participants, but because it's a unique resource that hundreds of men have found invaluable throughout the group's 30+ year history.

Regular massage is a great way to de-stress and maintain the body, but it gets expensive getting one every week. Therefore, I'm looking for a massage partner to trade regular massages. Serious inquires only, and absolutely platonic.

In Case I missed you, I was looking for someone that I can have stimulating conversation with, the type that ignites interesting thoughts and total curiosity. 

The kind of conversation that leads to a really wonderful friendship,
the type of friendship that is very unique in its circumstance, one that brings with it a desire
to someday meet.

The meeting will be nice in the sense that the chemistry that was first felt through emails,
will be even more evident in real life. It will create this attraction....an undeniable feeling of
lust, desire, and infatuation. A feeling that is unique, the type that we are completely without in our lives.

We will create this mutual respect along with caring feelings that only you and I will understand.
Our thought of each other will be constant and bring with it smiles throughout our day. 
This change in our lives will allow us to be happy:) and to once again, live life contently. 
So, in case I missed you, I am still here waiting for you.

Can you hear that?...... Neither can I:) but I can feel it....Time is ticking away.
Are we going to wait forever to experience the feelings of passion and desire again?
Are we going to have to stick our teeth in a glass of water before we can make-out again?
Will our walkers and canes become our new sex toys that we really don't even know how to use?
Can two people even fit on one of those electric scooter chair things without it tipping over in the street?
Is there even a back seat on them for making-out?
I don't want to change my depends, before making passionate love with someone I have a deep emotional connection with.
And, I never want Bingo to be my ""big date"" night either.

My current relationship feels like canes, walkers, and teeth in a glass of water on the nightstand.

I would love to find someone special before time ticks away. Someone that I have incredible feelings for, someone that has these same type of feelings for me. 
I am a healthy white male, in great physical shape. Smart. successful, completely drug and Viagra free......and I love to have fun. 

I am looking for the right woman to spend time, and to share special moments with. 
A woman that I can share a very special friendship with, a friendship that never involves canes, walkers, or those stupid electric chair things.
Maybe we can spend some of that time that we do have left.............together.

We are a band of friends looking to expand our social circle. We are one female and two guys (one male is married to the female). Sometimes the circle gets bigger depending on the events but that is the main core of it. We are in our 30's, drama free, no kids, active and fit, funny, and very social. We are out of Oakland, will go anywhere in the bay area that offers fun activities, good entertainment, food, or drinks or all of the above. We are down to try new things and love to travel. This has nothing to do with sex so don't even ask! This is about being strictly friends and having a fun time.
Please tell us more about you. Looking forward to getting to know you.
Sincerely,
CR, DH, SRH

Hey Guys:

I'm a nice gay man and looking for ""Just Friends"". Yes, there is the Men Seeking Men section here on CL, but I'm NOT looking for a hookup. I'm looking for other nice, honest, drug free guys, either gay or straight to hang out with, go to a movie, get something to eat together, go for walks with me and my chihuahua named Sadie.

I am on full time disability due to a medical condition, so I do not work, but I went to school at UC Berkeley Adult Extension School and learned how to program databases using a software called Microsoft Access. I now provide database design services for extra money to use to enjoy myself with.

When I am home alone, I enjoy spending quality time with Sadie cuddling and loving her while we watch our favorite TV shows. A far as movies go, I am interested in all types of movies from action and adventure to love stories / romantic films. I would also be interested in going to see shows that are live on stage. I think there is a theater here in Berkeley called the Aroura Theater where they do live stage plays. When I was a kid, I lived in San Jose with my parents and we got season tickets to the The San Jose Civic Light Opera Theater and saw many big named stars in some really great performances. I would LOVE to do that again.

I am interested in meeting other mature acting guys, as I said, either straight or gay who also have a decent sense of humor so we can have a good time together laughing about whatever.........

I am totally open to learning all about you and YOUR personal interests, and who knows, I just might learn something new! After all, isn't that what a true quality friendship is all about is when you learn new things about your friends ?

I'm not necessarily that religious of a guy, but if you are, I am totally open to joining you at your church. If I had to choose, I would say that I believe in Christianity. And I would say that my personal feelings are that all the things in the Bible did not actually happen, but that they are simply stories that make moral points to help guide us in our daily lives. In other words, I do not believe that Moses actually parted the Red Sea, but that story just makes a point. 

YOU BE: 35-55yo, nice, have a good sense of humor, drug free, you don't take life too seriously, but yet you are a very responsible, law abiding guy.

Fun, friendly, honest indian guy looking for a good at heart woman for friendship. I'm in my late forties, tall, fit, hwp, easy-going.

Life is reasonably good but its often boring without a companion, more so during the weekends or holidays. I'm looking for someone who feels the same way, who is good at heart and interested in getting to know a friendly stranger, without any pressure or expectations. Your age or ethnicity doesn't matter much, what matters is your craving to have some fun in otherwise monotonous life..

A little something about me, I'm fun to be with, like to laugh & make others laugh, I don't play games, drama free, I like to try anything and everything at least once and have varied interests and hobbies. 

I don't want to know anything you don't want me to know, like where you live, how old you are, where you work, whether married or not, have kids or not or what not. We all have our baggage and so lets keep that aside for once and see what's on the other side. Will respect your limits and boundaries, whatever that may be...

Lets exchange few emails and take it from there. There is no obligation whatsoever. We won't exchange pictures until we are serious about each other and hear each others voice on the phone or skype so pic collectors pls excuse.

Yes you read the headline right I am looking for a Netflix friend, if you don't have Netflix it's ok I have it on my ps3. I am looking for a friend to hang out with and go places get something to eat or we can get it to go and come back and eat while watching movies and shows on Netflix. This is not a hook up ad whatsoever it is a friendship ad because that is what I seek is a friendship that could grow into an even better friendship. I mean there are a lot of places I would love to go but it wouldn't be fun going by myself, I have heard about this haunted mini golf place, the Exploratorium, even go play laser tag if you're just as fun and goofy as me. I am just looking for a good and fun SINGLE woman friend who knows that our friendship won't get sexual but will be flirtatious at times and wouldn't mind that at all. Also you better be willing to laugh because I love making people laugh because I have tons of jokes like listen to this:
""There were 3 women who escape prison a blond, a brunette, and a redhead, and. . .""
Aww sorry in order for you to hear the rest of that joke and many more you will have to reply to my ad and get to know me, but trust me you won't be disappointed at all.

Getting right to the point this is not facebook...so looking for just friends only here is not the #1 goal. I'm realistic so only respond to me if you can be realistic too. I know most guys online want that 'one thing' on everyone's mind. But I'm different. Honestly I want to take things to the sexual level I'm looking for with you first THEN mix friendship in, to make sure we click on that friendship level after hooking up. I do things my way, not the ""normal"" way. Try to follow along. Why meet for regular ""dates"" just to immediately assume that you don't click with someone only because you're so nervous? 

I like to have fun like most guys on these personals but I also like having deep conversations and making actual progress with someone along the way. So no I do not want what others want for their secret agendas; I want a guy that I can get to know a little first over the phone, go to your house to talk and hook up ON THE FIRST MEET, then be prepared to more than potentially have an on-going friendship with benefits if it's there. I'm more than capable of being real friends with real benefits, and am strongly looking for a guy who can be ready enough to follow my lead.

For hanging out I like movies, hiking, shopping, definitely clubbing, can do video games, walking around town, going out to local eateries to avoid fast-food and more. I'm 5'9 tall, masculine, average to thicker/stocky body build, short hair casual attire. Sometimes classy when going out but still masculine. I'm down to earth, funny, open-minded, outspoken, etc. Please be single and not currently attached to someone like your ex. Save the complications.

I do not send face pics, and I am not into judging looks or appearance. Too many people with fake pics and phony intentions, or robots who are simply pic collectors. We can talk on the phone, connect then just meet in person because I have nothing to hide so why try to stop at pictures? In fact I find that the best connections come from not having high expectations off of looks. Instead of being shallow, just be attracted to a personality, not a picture/looks. Race isn't important to me; however I do like being interracial whether it be friendship or more.... Clearly you should feel the same way. I only expect replies from guys who are open-minded about any race. In example, I love Latinos and Asians (yum) but if someone other than that is ringing my bell, then it is what it is :) For the record I'm a top looking for a submissive bttm to be down with who loves sex...and you be able host when we go further or for plan B in the car somewhere parked because I cannot host. Like under the stars chillin'.

Keeping in touch is key...We all have busy lives--you ARE NOT the only one with a busy schedule. If you say you want to meet, just fucking make the time for it and keep the plans. Or else stay the fuck offline. I cannot stress that enough. And back to pictures, it's annoying to exchange pictures with guys who can't follow through or keep the momentum going...if you're claiming to want even just a friend you should already have the time for them. By the way there's no sure way to tell if someone is a match on day 1. Real chemistry doesn't happen in 5 seconds, it happens over time after discovering there are general mutual interests. I want a guy who's prepared to meet with me a few different times before judging any chemistry.

The only real preference for FWB I have is age...I need a guy around my age who can keep up with me. So 18-29 hmu. But since it's a preference not a requirement, older guys feel free to be bold and hmu if you think we can still be good together :)

I'm an avid nudist, enjoy the outdoors, love travelling, photography, and being with like-minded people.

I have a trans-male friend that I met a few months ago and loves the nudist/naturist lifestyle. I'm looking for more trans people (male and female) to enjoy the nudist/naturist life with in a close-knit group setting. This is an excellent way to become comfortable in your own skin, and be around others who have nothing but love and respect for you and enjoy who you are, not what you have.

For me, it's being free in nature, surrounding myself with the fresh air, and taking in all that nature has to offer. It can also be a spiritual-healing moment for many who are searching for something more.

Common activities include:
- home gatherings (movies, games, food)
- outdoor activities (nature walks, nudist beaches, camping, hiking, etc)
- urban exploring (google if you do not know what this is)
- clothing-optional hot springs (tecopa, saline valley, death valley)

Please include a photo of yourself in your kitchen when you respond (weeds out spambots and pervs who can't read). I'll gladly respond in kind if true, or delete if no photo. I also request that we meet in person before joining our small group as this is a trusted circle and we only let in those who truly seek the nudist lifestyle (vs those who are in it for sex). This helps calm any jitters and allows us to be ourselves without proving anything.

Hope to hear from you soon. Cheers! :-)

P.S. This is not an ad for casual sex. Pervs and the like will be reported.

I weight 240.5 (cant forget .5 right?). When i got out of the Army i weighed aprox. 130lbs., with an eight pack and i look DAMN good, i was also 23; I am now 35 (well will be on Jan. 8th) and i dont wanna be fat anymore. 

I used to be power lifter, well an amatuer one, i didn't lift for anyother reason except to get stronger, i did, but then i got hurt at work, i ballooned from 205lbs. to 204.5lbs., and weak (well weaker than i was, but probably stronger than most). 

I can lift again, i can run again, and most importantly i want to, however it is boring; yes, i can go to the gym for six hours a day, and then walk my dogs for an hour, and inbetween make specific meals (im a Chef; well now dont you feel lucky?) and then sleep for six and...well etc. etc. (it's etc. NOT ect. btw) and i'll lose the weight, and look damn good (i look pretty good now, but perfection can always be perfected...i know, i have high self-esteem, but i promise im not an asshole nor conceited, just self-assured), but it'll get boring and who knows how long it'll last before i go back into my old, lazy ways, 

SO...i am on here (not a bad place btw, but very, VERY eye-opening, and a little weird in certain spots - not saying weird is bad -) trying to find someone who wants to sweat, and work, and moan and groan with me, and as i stated in the subject line : ""those who sweat together, sweat in other ways together"", and im sure i don't have to specific to relay what i'm saying.

Currently my workout schedule is wideopen, as i still am on Workers Comp., but if i had my druthers, i'd perfer to workout early, early in the AM or late in the evening ie. 3/4am or 10/11pm, HOWEVER i can do it during the day too. I just know that when i go back to work, ill have to change the schedule and i work 0700-1500 in San Leandro, so doing it early in the AM ie. 3/4am would be kick-ass.

The actual workout schedule would simple: running, lifting weights, walking, push-ups/situps, swimming (yes in the winter too) and maybe even some console workouts ie. Wii fitness (i don't actual have this game, but i do do console workouts, why, because they're fun and they make you laugh.

As far as what i'm looking for, i am looking for someone to go on this path me; where it takes us, that's yet to be seen. Maybe we'll just be workout partners, maybe we'll fall in love and maybe...well there's a lot of inbetween, but let's start off with your name (my name is Jacob btw) and coffee.

Hi, there,

I'd like to talk to people who share a common world-view related to:

natural health rather than the medical industry's idea of it,

openness to subjects like auras, telepathy, energy healing, and synchronicities but not religious or New Age,

debunking propaganda that's so ubiquitious on the news and reading research in depth with healthy skepticism and serious attention to its funding and layers of possible deception,

a playful sense of humor and lightness to create fun rather than just focusing on the world problems.

If after talking it seems like we'd really resonate in person, it could be fun to go dancing to cheap live music, go to the art museum - I have a membership, watch movies, go for walks, to organic restaurants or cook together, share our artistic pursuits with each other, maybe even make funny video shorts if you have a camera, or just hang out and talk. Not looking for either of us to spend much money on our entertainment. 

Please don't ask me to text as I don't use a cell phone. Feel free to include a photo.

Just what it says on the tin. Need advice from someone anonymous on the Internet, who has experience in my field

So I graduated law school in 2014. I didn't know it at the time, but I was beginning to be overwhelmed by the tidal wave of bipolar disorder and clinical depression. I had been experiencing the onset of these illnesses for years, but it really came to a breaking point during my law school years. To cut the story short, I completely crashed upon graduating law school. I couldn't hold it together anymore, and consequently have spent the past 2 years trying to figure out just what exactly is my diagnosis (I now have it - bipolar II) and how to manage it.

In that time, I haven't passed the bar, haven't been able to work, haven't been able to do anything but struggle with these demons. It has been a difficult time.

Now as 2016 begins, I'm finally starting to feel like a human being again. And I want my life back. I had a dream to be a lawyer, but now I don't know how to grasp for it or where to start. I have to take the bar exam in June, which will be the Uniform Bar Exam, and then convince a law firm to hire me...but I have no idea how to explain away two blank years on my resume, bad law school grades due to mental illness, and a useless liberal arts background prior to law school. I know I have brains - I got a 170 on the LSAT, which I took just before my mental illness started to really shatter me - but I've learned the hard way that brains aren't enough.

I'm not here looking for someone to give me a job or anything like that. I would just really appreciate some advice and guidance from attorneys who might know what steps I need to take to make myself employable. I did have a dream of working in corporate law, and I actually really loved learning about transactional work in law school, but I am unsure about how to market myself to those big firms. 

Anyway, if you feel like responding, I'd love to hear any pearls of wisdom. If not, thanks for reading anyway. :)

Wish you had a friend you can talk to about anything and everything. Someone you can be silly with someone to lean on. Have a confidant and talk about frustrations. Talk about random things. Help the days go faster and have a few laughs. Some one who can relate to marriage and parenting life? Well that's exactly what I'm looking for.

The truth is much of my life takes place doing simple things like making dinner, taking long drives,enjoying the sun and, when it does, the rain. I find a way to enjoy each moment of simplicity by belting out songs on the radio while driving. What I miss is quiet time to just recharge my batteries. Life is too short to take everything so seriously, so I try to take it in stride and take each moment as it comes. I tend to have a witty (sometimes sarcastic) sense of humor, so anyone I meet needs to be able to keep up and not be easily offended. I'm looking for someone to spend quality times with, because everything is more enjoyable and memorable when you have someone to share them with.

Are you someone that knows when the moment is serious and can engage appropriately?
How to ""summarize"" oneself or another in a clearly delineated box? The odds of finessing this successfully are slim to none. But here I am and there you have it. At once, infinitely complex and multidimensional and simple at my core, as I think we all are. I am at home and happy in my own skin. Do you find yourself in a similar place? Drawn to those with passions and creative pursuits that fuel and feed them, I find that this life and this world offers immense opportunity for childlike wonder, explosions of pure creativity, eruptions of infinite bliss, and a potent affinity for the absurd amidst all of it.

I am a very curious person and this curiosity manifests itself through travel. New cultures and environments fascinate me and I thrive on meeting new people and learning about their cultures. It's exciting for me to explore and learn about the world and would love to meet someone who enjoys this as well.

I am the kind of person who stays and read the credits at the end of a movie; will let a person cut in front of me at the grocery store if they have just a couple of items to buy, believe in paying it forward and karma. Volunteering is important to me

I have no ulterior motive or agenda. I'm an adult and I expect the same from my partner. Can smoothly transition from most situations with ease (and style), which I hear is a plus.

I am verbal, congenial, and halal. OK, I don't really keep halal. But I liked the rhyme. I love freedom of expression in all forms

So what do you think? Want to give this a whirl?

I am an avid outdoors person and a safe, experienced climber. Unfortunately, my regular climbing partners have all moved away one by one due to the economy and other reasons. I have not climbed regularly in a while but wish to begin climbing seriously again. I prefer to climb outdoors and intend to get outside as much as possible as the weather permits but will happily climb in a gym when outside is not an option. I would prefer to link up with a female climbing partner for the time being. I've climbed with many people over the years and I just prefer to focus on the climbing now and not the egos and competitiveness that male climbers typically bring with them. (This mainly as well as I just simply enjoy the company of women!) I have taught many first timers from boy scout troops to friends of friends so don't be afraid to respond, all skill levels welcome.

For a while, I've been developing a series cannabis infused oils as external ointments, (but they are quite edible), to be used as lip-balms and or skin ointments. All of these ointments have a very mild sedative effect, but there's no way that they could considered euphoric. But recently I've developed something a lot more potent. From several reports that I've received so far it seems to supercharge the libido and kick the horny factor into overdrive.

Now I need more women to use their vaginas to advance the frontiers of hedonistic research All that you would have to do at first is try massaging a teaspoon of the salve inside your vagina and around your clitoris, (I'm assuming you'd try some under your tongue first so as to assure yourself of it's safety and well as effectiveness) and then wait about 15 minutes. Then play with yourself and/or your partner. We'll adjust the formula using the results of your test. There will be absolutely no pressure on you to have me as your sex partner. I doubt you'd find me an adequate partner anyway. I'm 63 years old, partially disabled and have a big-time heart condition. Not only am I, almost by definition a lousy fuck, but fucking would probably kill me.

You must a valid ID proving that you're 18+ years of age and have a valid medical marijuana card in order for me to give you 1/2 oz.(2~4 doses), of this lubricant. Other than that it's a free trip.... Just tell me what you think about it.

Fit, funny, and a bit sarcastic, married realist on the handsome and skinny side of 45 seeking fellow fit, feisty mom for early morning running/jogging in Baylands and streets. 

Just looking to fill the social/mental gaps while getting my endorphin high. I joke around a lot better with women than men, and I need a partner to force me outta bed. (insert oneliner and rimshot here.) Wifey doesn't run, and we both agree that having some separate friend/activity circles is a healthy longterm life plan. As for you being partnered, too... I'm just guessing we would have more chat fodder if you have a hubby and/or kids to complain about or bounce reactions back at me. Common ground makes for a good running partner... hehe, get it? 

Serious exercisers only, though... this is legit for running slash peer pressure slash looking good slash having some laughs. Not racing. Just mellow/moderate pace, but 2 mile endurance or more would be optimal. 

I don't care what kind of shoes you have, as long as your feet are fleet and your attitude is in the right place. Look good, feel good, laugh. No judgment.

Not a huge fan of the Dish crowds, but I can hang if Stanford's your preference. Just make it worth my while and have some good stories to tell: kids, work, vacation, parties.

When a couple friend of mine was going through a rough time in their marriage, someone suggested that they go through couples therapy. Not the usual boring dribble in a specialists office, but in the bedroom. It was the best thing that happened to their marriage.

I was the lucky therapist. Though I did not actively participate in sex, I would tell them what to do. We ended up tearing the artificial boundaries that they had created between them and made them feel intimate again. I would say ""slide her panties to the side and go down on her"" or ""lick him from the balls to the tip"". I made them say and do things that they had stopped saying or doing. They say it saved their marriage.

I'm 21 and on my last semester of college (graduate Spring).
I'm a Latina. I enjoy cooking. I recently chose to cut out meat from my diet so that has been interesting. I have a med card and love smoking/ so I would like a friend who can smoke with me whenever. I like running/ going to the gym. I used to do it just so I could eat what I want, but now I actually wanna be fit. I'm funny, chill, not into drama, love listening to and sharing music.

...a stranger to take a chance on meeting?
It's not easy, let me tell you. 
And what if one has a desire to perform acts (or have acts performed on them) that don't conform with the ""normal"" means of making friends?
You see, I'm not one to make small talk. I'm not well versed in the art of pick-up. Yet I know what I like and want, and yes, I know how to give and please. It's just that I'm not very good at chatting about inconsequential, meaningless things. I prefer deep, probing conversations and intimate physical contact.
Of course we can talk, joke, and get to know each other. But ultimately I want to massage you. Explore you. Experiment with you. Just as I want to be massaged, explored, and experimented with.
People are into so many things, so many acronyms. Edging. BDSM. CFNM. Swinging. Tantra. Voyeurism. Exhibitionism. Anal. Oral. Tech. Hentai. 420. GB. ...on and on. We all have our kinks and fetishes.
This is where I find myself at this moment - I'm curious, feeling the need to experiment and try new and exciting things.
I'm on a quest for Discovery. I seek to discover people, sensations, experiences, boundaries, women. Women in all their glory.
So tell me...what excites you? What intrigues you? Be it sexual, intellectual, emotional, physical or spiritual, I would like to hear about it and possibly experience it with you

Hi there!

I'm looking for local girlfriends who live in Mountain View or very near to. Most of my friends live somewhat far away and I would love to make more friends closer to home! Weekdays are best for me, I get very busy on the weekends. 

About me:
I just turned 30, I will be married in four months to the love of my life. I love making new friends and socializing. I love drinking coffee. My friends tend to describe me as being fun, but I know when to take things down a notch and be serious too. I'm not afraid to dance when no one else is. I love to sing karaoke. I love fashion, and own my own business selling designer clothing on eBay. I have a theater background. As a side job, I occasionally work at Stanford school of medicine as a standardized patient, which is basically an acting job to help medical students get out of their textbooks and learn how to talk to patients. I am girly, but a tomboy at heart.

I am a very outgoing person. My personality is very bubbly and happy. I am a Libra, if that means anything to you! My most compatible friendships are usually Leos, Sagittarians, Libras, Gemini and Aquarius. If you happen to be one of those signs, you should totally contact me! (NOT required though, lol!) If that weirded you out, then you probably shouldn't contact me. :P

Fav bands: Florence and the Machine, Beats Antique
Fav movies: I have a lot but to list a few- Moulin Rouge, Lion King, Lord of the Rings, Mary Poppins, Hook, Harry Potter, Back to the Future 
Fav shows: Again, I have a lot, but I will say that I love Doctor Who, Pushing Daisies and Futurama. I like a lot of different shows, for example I just finished watching Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and now I am starting Downton Abbey. It depends on my mood!

I love to learn, I love to read, I love to take walks, I listen to classical music for relaxation, I love to laugh most of all! Life is too short, so I try to live it!

If you live in Mountain View and I didn't scare you off so far, then send me an email! Please tell me more about yourself, it's only fair :P

Talk to you soon, my friend!

I some help understanding something. I'm sure it's a people issue but my recent and past experience has been with women. That's why I'm posting here, looking for perspective. Have you ever known someone that gives so much of herself to people that continue just taking or are constantly needing something? Here is my situation: I'm a very independent guy. Meaning, I don't really need a lot in terms of support, affirmation or so forth. If I'm seeing someone I want their attention simply because if I'm dating them, I really do like them. I had an ex that always went out her way to help out anyone that asked. That could be spending time, loaning money or other efforts. It got to the point where it affected our relationship when she would seemingly drop me to be there for her friend in need. It was a problem because most of her friends where in need of something. It was crazy because she seemed to feel more connected to someone the more they helped them, regardless if it interfered with her own well-being. I just recently experienced that again with a girl in a similar lifestyle. What blows me away is that they both said how easy it was with me. They were both always so at ease when we were together. When we were together, things were amazing but when we weren't, they were bad because they were stressing or completely preoccupied with whatever friend was in need. I will say too, that it wasn't always someone in ""need"" it was also things like these people were the ones who planned everyone's birthday or other get together and really had to go all out even if they just met or barely knew someone. I don't expect all of someone's time. I know people have lives before they met me. Typically there's a good balance when I date someone and they aren't surrounded by people in constant need. 
So, do I have issues or is it something lacking in their lives? I consider myself a nice guy and I help out friends and I'm there for them but I don't let it affect my happiness. Maybe that's what truly makes them happy but I don't see that. They're stressed, some broke and seem to feel obligated. I just don't get it. Let me know your thoughts.

Hello All!

I'm a 28 year old female graduate student who is currently looking for a gym partner. I'm hoping to find another woman around my age (6 yrs in either direction is fine by me!) who is looking to get in shape. I'm looking to lose about 70-100lbs, and would love to work out and build a friendship with a motivated woman with a similar amount of weight to lose. 

I'm currently a member of 24 hour fitness, so you would need to be one too or willing to become one. I would like to go to the gym 2 times a week to start, and am hoping to go on Mondays and Wednesdays- we can discuss times once we meet. I'm up for cardio, strength training, swimming, and group classes! Relaxing in the sauna or getting some tea after the gym to chat and catch up would be great as well. 

I would love it if we could go to the 24 in Union City near Target. If you're interested, please respond to this with a piece of gym equipment or class you'd like to learn to use or try out in the title. In your email tell me a bit about yourself and your goals, perhaps give me a link to one of your social media sites (Instagram or Facebook is preferred, no judgement if you don't utilize social media). We can then set up a time to grab tea and see if we'd like to try becoming gym partners. 

I'm open to more than one person as well so if you have a friend, or are open to meeting up with others who respond to this email, even better!!!

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Hi all - 

As many times as I've tried this, I've had little luck with finding other moms who are GENUINELY interested in getting together for play dates, mom night outs, etc. And I really want to think I'm not the only mom out here who'd enjoy some other female companionship.

I am a 27 year old, married mommy of a 4 year old boy with baby boy #2 on the way :) I am educated, employed, opinionated, meat-eating, west coast transplant (from the east coast), honest, non-judgmental, ambitious, mouth like a sailor, 420 & drink friendly and tattooed. 

I'd love to plan outings and get togethers from park playdates, to fairs / festivals, groupon/ livingsocial activities, weekend trips, camping, shows, sitting at home doing nothing lol anything goes really - we're open and flexible!

I'm hoping to find at least ONE other mommy who feels the same and is willing to make time to create a true friendship! I have an entrepeurnial spirit and it would be awesome if you did too so we could bounce ideas off each other and brainstorm? heated political debates? there is no topic that is taboo for me. In the near future, I'd also like a workout buddy to lose this baby weight - I'm most interested in boxing / kickboxing & zumba - but def open to other things...

I ask very little from mom friends but to be yourself and non-judgmental - if based on my info you don't think we'd get along - then don't reply - simple as that. I understand we're all busy and I'm not a fan of wasting either of our time. If you're attached, great! If not, that's fine too. 

If any of this sounds at all interesting to you then let me know and I'll respond asap. I go on maternity leave soon so I'll have some time...Hope to hear back soon!

Hello!

I will start by noting that this ad is cross-posted in both this forum, as well as the M4W section. This seems to be the best way to cover the bases relative to what I'm looking for. I'm seeking something more on the platonic level first, but I'm open to a deeper relationship down the road if we really click.

Busy professional here, looking for enjoyable times with an interesting and down-to-earth female companion.

Some basics about me: SWM, late-40s, 6', HWP, INTJ, non-smoker, well-educated, easy-going with a great sense of humor, never married, and no kids. I've been through my share of moves, domestic and international travel, jobs, and relationships, and have developed a well-rounded perspective on the world-at-large. I would now like to find a compatible female companion to share the happenings around here and see what develops. Movies, music, dining, art, museums, and day hikes/trips are good ways to get me out of the house.

Please write back if any of this initially intrigues you. I'm open some email time before we meet, so don't feel as though you have to provide your life story on the first go-around (but no one-liners). A picture or two would also be great, but if you would like to correspond a little bit first, I am OK with that. I'll do likewise. I'm just seeking solid, genuine, interesting companionship to help ease the pressures of Silicon Valley life.

Thanks for reading my post!

Working from home is an irony -- in principle it should be super-productive, stripped of the distractions of an office, freed of the need for a time-sapping commute. But it rarely lives up to the promise. External distractions give way to internal distractions. The irony of deep loneliness in the middle of a crowded city. It helps to get out of the house and to a public space, which I'll probably do soon.

Anyway, if anyone wants to distract me with an email I'll respond.

College student, 35, male, stressed. At that half-way point between relationships where you are still quite convinced the opposite sex are mentally retarded, but at the same time, you're getting bored and possibly lonely. 

Looking for a calm female, with cool traits and chill attitude for hazy hijinks. You should have your own spot, or be cool with baked parking. Most likely surrounding the topics of movies, tunes and herb. Smoking, tinctures, edibles - whatever. You know, max-relax, etc. Will not respond to replies without a photo. Enough robots already, dude.

Fit, funny, and a bit sarcastic, married realist on the handsome and skinny side of 45 seeking fellow fit, feisty mom for early morning running/jogging in Baylands and streets. 

Just looking to fill the social/mental gaps while getting my endorphin high. I joke around a lot better with women than men, and I need a partner to force me outta bed. (insert oneliner and rimshot here.) Wifey doesn't run, and we both agree that having some separate friend/activity circles is a healthy longterm life plan. As for you being partnered, too... I'm just guessing we would have more chat fodder if you have a hubby and/or kids to complain about or bounce reactions back at me. Common ground makes for a good running partner... hehe, get it? 

Serious exercisers only, though... this is legit for running slash peer pressure slash looking good slash having some laughs. Not racing. Just mellow/moderate pace, but 2 mile endurance or more would be optimal. 

I don't care what kind of shoes you have, as long as your feet are fleet and your attitude is in the right place. Look good, feel good, laugh. No judgment.

Not a huge fan of the Dish crowds, but I can hang if Stanford's your preference. Just make it worth my while and have some good stories to tell: kids, work, vacation, frustration.

Short email conversing period required, just to confirm compatibility and lack of kook. Let me know if you're balancing on the life slackrope of life, and how to make this fit your fitness goals.

I don't sag my pants and I always wear a belt and I always like to smell good whenever I leave the house.

Hi guys, girls or small groups of friends. I need help experiencing a new fantasy I want to try. After being wrapped in a base of plastic wrap (Saran wrap), I want to be wrapped, head to toe, like a mummy, in duct tape. 

I found videos, on the internet, of people being mummified in duct tape. I found it extremely exciting, and I want it to be done to me. Obviously, I cannot do it myself. So, I need willing volunteers who would have fun wrapping me up in duct tape. 



I read blogs, online, by people who practice total mummification by duct tape regularly. They say it is like getting a ""HIGH"" without using drugs. Being wrapped tightly, and the total sensory deprivation (ear plugs inserted, blindfolds, etc) can give a sense of total euphoria.

I am not wacko or crazy. I am a nice, easy going, fun guy who found a new interest.

OK, here are the conditions:
I am married, you would have to host me. My wife is not into bondage.
We would have to meet and talk first to establish a mutual trust.
You would wrap me exactly as I want to be wrapped.
You would unwrap me at the end of the bondage session.
I will supply all materials needed for the procedure.

I HOPE SOMEONE WILL HELP ME ""WRAP THIS UP"" VERY SOON.

Don't know why I'm posting as I know I won't get a response but here's to trying.

So I don't have much friends, not really anyone close to talk to. Although I'm in a committed relationship, I feel an empty void which ceases any motivation to do anything new. Am I just settling? 

I wish I can find a nice pen pal or even good female friend. A best friend. A gym partner to motivate health, A geeky girl for gaming entertainment, a realist to converse with. Share stories, share opinions, and most of all a guide to life. 

I don't know what I'm doing but I'm letting life respond...

I've tried other places, and dating websites to find new friends. But things never work out as they are either interested in dating, or don't believe when I say I'm looking for a friend.

Also if you're interested in chatting or miss the old instant messaging days. Message me on kik oxy1984.

Hey there!

Are you also involved with someone, who at one time may have been exciting but no longer is? Not just sexually (though that may be a big deal for you), but emotionally? Have you drifted apart, yet stay together for your own reasons? Would you like to commiserate sometime over coffee? I'm buying! 

But seriously, I'm a handsome (maybe I'm bias), tall, average-built, also involved, 40-something, looking for a similar ""ear"" to share stories and even secrets with. I'm witty, intelligent, very cordial and considerate, love probing questions, and enjoy deep conversations -- especially the most controversial subjects.

I have no bounds, but my objective is NOT to have sex with you (unless of course we absolutely have to). Intimacy is a very interesting thing and can only truly be enjoyed when an emotional connection is made. Let's just leave that part out (for now) and see what happens . . . 

PS ... I won't hold you responsible for not liking me, physically or otherwise. We are complex creatures and like what we like. The end. :) 

Please say hello! 

I am 100% real and serious. You should be, too. And bots/prostitutes: DO NOT ask me to ""verify"" myself on your ""free"" site. I've not raped or killed anyone, nor have I thought about raping or killing anyone - ever, but thank you for your efforts. ;)

I'm a 31 year old (single, white, if that matters) guy who lives a busy (work)life. I'm a heavy set guy (284lbs, 6'1"") and I have been gaining weight a lot lately due to inactivity and unhealthy eating habits. I live in the city and I work in tech industry as a software engineer. I really love my job and that kinda makes me a bit of a workaholic. I don't have much of a life outside of work which often manifests as me staying at the office at late hours. When I'm not working I like to read books(mostly sci-fi), watch tv shows, go to movies, play xbox, catch up on science and technology. When I manage to take time off from work, I really like going for walks around the city and hike the coastal trails.

I'm looking for someone who is in a similar life situation. Basically if any of the following applies:
- busy life and struggles to keep weight down
- makes excuses for not exercising
- really want to get healthy but need a push and someone to motivate you
- are already healthy and/or fit, but would like someone to work on and motivate

I don't care if you're married, in a relationship or single. I would really like to stress that I am not looking for a romantic relationship of any kind and I am not hoping this to develop into anything more than a friendship. No ""casual"" encounters or anything like that. One thing I do ask is that if you are in a relationship or in a marriage and your partner tends to be jealous kind, I'd ask you to skip this ad. I am all about no drama, and I do not want to spend time making excuses or doing things in secret because of your partner.

What I am looking for is an activity partner for walking, hiking, gym and/or just exploring the city. Basically I would like to find someone I could make plans with to go for walks and have an excuse to not stay at work so late. :)

Just send me a mail and we can get to know each other a little better and go for a coffee or something. I'm not a creep and I'd also like to verify that you're not one, so meeting in a public place first would be ideal.

Hate going it alone or would love to have some company and conversation for outing, activities or adventures? Same here...

Not looking for anything more than a new friend, good company and conversation, someone who'd like to do things together. Not opposed to it growing into more but far more interested in having the company and friend and keeping it uncomplicated.

I'm smart, witty at times, a white collar professional, a good conversationist most of the time and generally know as fun to be around (I hope). I'm easy on the eyes, attractive even. I'm easy going and keep things light - understand the value of just having a good conversation and time.

I'm looking for someone who would enjoy what I have to offer and offer much of the same. If you're the kind of person who says ""ask me anything"" or I've got to pry it out of you, that's not my thing. I'll do my share, you do yours.

I appreciate a walk in the park or the beach and a cup of coffee as much as I would a glass of wine or dinner. Maybe a standing date to do something once a week, or even nothing and just a chat over coke. 

Please respond with enough to share who you are and what you might like to do.

No drugs, smokers, married men and one liners. A general preference for someone my age (40-50 range).

Hi there thanks for clicking on my ad.

I'm a hoarder and it makes me very embarrassed and ashamed. Since I'm uncomfortable inviting people over or even letting them know about my situation, it makes me distance myself from people, afraid of being rejected by them if they were ever to find out. But that also makes me very lonely, and even though I sometimes think that no one could accept me for this one thing, I believe that I do have qualities that I could offer someone, kind, caring, affectionate, reasonably intelligent, not unattractive (I guess, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, my exes thought I was attractive). I think it also makes it harder being gay too. Gay guys have the stereotype of being super tidy and put together. I'm not either of those. 

I know it probably sounds like I'm looking for something romantic, and I'm not opposed to it, but I'm posting in Strictly Platonic because I really am just trying to find people who are supportive and can help me, people that'll show me that there are people out there that won't run away if they find out I'm a hoarder. 

If you made it this far, thanks so much for reading. Sorry it's such a long ad. If you feel that you'd be willing to reach out and help me, that would be great. Thanks!

Just love that song. Can't feel depressed after hearing it. It's the best Beatles song because it's impossible from listening to it to know who wrote it. With the Beatles, usually the lead singer is also the writer. On ""She Loves You,"" McCartney and Lennon both sing a harmonized lead. In fact, they both played a hand in writing it, unlike many of their other songs, which were written by one or the other. For a group that was so much more than the sum of its parts, ""She Loves You"" exemplifies what made the Beatles great.

You could comment on that or just put into the subject line something you'd like to talk about. I'm into music, films, politics, money, etc. Often bored, always looking to converse.

Im not looking for type person in particular, more personality, ability to converse about more then just top trending google searches. any body from high school to hospice, just smell nice cause I like the idea of sleeping next to someone....Im from Hawaii and don't believe in a/c so snuggle season is something special, gotta get it.

Need to get back into shape and it would be much more enjoyable with a friend for some motivation and to pass the time better. 

Im a 31 year old caucasian male, not out of shape, just need to get my wind back and strengthen up a bit. Would be nice if you were in the Foster City, San Mateo area or close to that. 

Tell me about yourself and activities you'd like to do for exercise and we'll go from there.
