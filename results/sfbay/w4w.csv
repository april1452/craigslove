Hello not a dating post but I have a quaint older 2 bedroom apartment

1 bathroom only shared with me. I am renting out the ""extra bedroom"" 

including all utilities, WIFI, etc. It's a smaller bedroom totally furnished

with a twin bed. It has a large walk-in closet. it's an upstairs unit 1 flight 

of stairs and fairly very quiet tenants. There is a washer/dryer in building.

I will not be in your face or your business I ask the same. No overnight 

guests unit too small. The rent is great $850.00 and Bart is 2 blocks away. 

Trader Joe's the works, light cooking please. $400. deposit. On street 

parking could be half to one block away. Sunshine Gardens not foggy like 

near Tanforan or Daly City at all.

So, this may sound pretty weird but I am so tired of dating and meeting people who 1) have some sort of catch (they're married, not over their ex, or are pregnant..I know I have bad luck with women apparently) 

I'm REALLY looking for someone to settle down with. I am 23 but have an old soul, I know what I want and who I am, I've done all my partying in my teen years (quite a lot, over it). The problem is I keep meeting people who aren't ready to settle down, or don't have the ultimate goal of getting married. I don't mean to sound unattractive by complaining, I just want to make the point that I am seeking a woman who is willing to pursue me in the hopes of settling down with me (WITHOUT crazy baggage). 
I'm going to be up front, if I like you I'm not very good at taking things slow. I like affection, I like reminding my girl how amazing she is all the time and apparently that is too much for some people to handle. I fall hard, which I recognize is a flaw but am seeking someone who is equally excited about me as I am them. Someone passionate, a hopeless romantic like myself. 

Now that we have that out of the way..

About me: 
23 
Full time employed by a MAJOR social networking site (not going to post which one, but feel free to ask) 
Introverted, I prefer snuggling up and watching a movie to clubbing any day. 
Enjoys being called daddy in bed (Just to get that out of the way haha) 
REALLY into physics, philosophy, psychology and deep conversations 
Working on getting sleeve tattoos, I have some big ones on my arms already.
5''6 
I do volunteer work, I love to help others!
Really (and obviously) sick of the dating scene. I am sure I will get some smart ass emails, but whatever. 
I love to write and read! #Nerd power
I play guitar, used to be in a punk band. 
Suuuuper romantic. 


If you're looking for someone who doesn't play games and is ready for something real and long term (and you think we'd be a good match) email me with a photo and some information about yourself. Let's go on a date! 

I'm really into androgynous women, so points if you fit that!

I'm looking for some lesbian, bi girl friends (ok, straight girls welcome too). In a relationship or single is OK with me. Just looking for different types of connections: platonic friends, fwb, hiking buddy, book nerd, weekend trip friend, texting only friend, etc. I'm pretty open minded so let's chat and see if there's a connection and see where it goes. Life is too short not to explore options. Plus, there are so many wonderful people in this world that it would be a shame not to try and meet someone new every once in a while. 

I'm 34, Mexican, femme to sporty spectrum, have a 4 year degree and a great career that I love. I enjoy hiking, random road trips and adventures, massages(giving and receiving), running, concerts, museums, trying new restaurants or recipes, I like going out (trust me...I can still party pretty hard), but I prefer intimate nights in with no TV, no cell phone, no distractions....just me and my friend being present, in the moment, and getting to know each other on a deeper level. 

Age is not important to me. It's what's inside that matters and if there's a connection. However, I have a weak spot for Latinas and other women of color with tomboy to feminine qualities who are curvy (at or above a size 8/10 and no more than size 18/20). 
If interested, send me a message and we'll see where this goes. Or reach me at Four 1Five, 6Eight _nine, eighty '99! 

Willing to travel around the Bay area for the right connection. I love exploring new places & enjoy driving.

[ABSOLUTELY NO MEN/COUPLES/DRUGS/STDs]

If love was a gamble, then I'd be a gambler.
If love was a poison that rips up my heart...
Sending piercing pain and joy into my veins...
Then, girl, I'll be happy to take that shot for you.
If love let me fall deeply for you;
Let me snuggle you with sweet embrace;
Let us make music and melodies with our moans of ecstasy,
Then, my God, let me fall in love.
Let me fall deeply in an all-consuming love;
My soul, my mind, and my body are yours.
Days, hours, minutes, seconds--I will be thinking of you;
Of your soft lips gliding down my neck and my hands gently teasing your torso;
Or the countless of times you whisper my name, and I yours;
Or the endless silent conversations that we have where no one spoke, but it was more than enough...

Me: Asian, lesbian, hopeless romantic, trustworthy, loyal, ambitious, great cook, great cuddler, tech-savvy, gamer, amateur guitarist, amateur poet, loves the outdoors, loves animals, wants to be a butterfly one day (ask me about it), wants a family (be it with kids or adopted animals), prefers tea over coffee. 

You: FEMALE, SINGLE, 23-28 years old, Caucasian/Asian, confident, independent, health conscious, down to earth, the girl next door, an adventurer, shy but also has a crazy side that yearns to be free, has an idea of what you want to do in life (doesn't have to be set in stone), wants more than a one night stand, can hold a conversation, am interested in me and will put in the effort to get to know me (I will do the same).

Respond to email with: the title of your favorite Movie/TV Series attached with a picture of you. Keep it PG.

I am a lesbian and looking to share a bright and private 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom apartment. The apartment is located in San Mateo, a short distance from the Hillsdale Caltrain Station, Highway 101 & Highway 92. I posted here but am not looking to date my room mate; only get the word out to a broader lesbian audience as this is a fabulous deal I think! :-)
The move-in date is April 1, 2016 [no fooling]; the monthly rent is ~ $1,600, this includes shared utilities.The leasing office does require running a background check which is $42. The leasing period is 15 months.
You would just need to furnish your own bedroom and some things in the living and kitchen area if need be.
I have 2 cats, I enjoy swimming, biking, long walks along the beach, visiting with friends & family, and new adventures. I am easy going and do enjoy privacy at times. If you are interested in talking about this opportunity, please respond to this posting. Thank you!

Have been single for quite a long time after a while you say is this all

there is? As we mature growing older many people tend to fade away in 

one way or another sometimes we find ourselves craving more as in 

companionship with a kind person that enjoys the ""simplicity"" of life........

No expectations of the 4TH of July on a daily basis. Not seeking turmoil 

laced with drama been there done that we will give that to someone else that

may wish to partake..........I like doing the walks, movies, junking a bit and 

much more.............can you teach me a few things life is always a process of 

learning and growth. Please be willing to share some of your time if you want 

a little companionship and a person to cuddle up with do reply. I'm told I am 

attractive but that's for someone else to decide. Please be 50's to 65 years 

of age. I look fit and I do take care of myself. Let me reiterate ""seeking simplicity""

I am not a white water rafter nor do I scale mountains but I do exercise, I walk tall

in shape but I am ""petite"" and still very capable of very long walks......... I think

my issue with extreme sports at this point is injury I would like to avoid!

Please no smokers.......I am 100% lesbian....like forever. This is safe not a scam or

anything to fear so take a step forward.

Buongiorno, 

Generally, I am interested in the person, not in their astrology, however, for this, I am solely relying on astrology to sharply narrow my options; particularly the possibility of being hurt due to some fundamental astro incompatibilities. Granted there are many things in life, other than astrological compatibility, that count for something, in relationships, however, who I am looking for is special. The relationship I am opening myself to be a part of is also special, and somewhat date specific. After decades of attracting the wrong type of women, I finally got into astrology, clearly saw why, and clearly saw the workaround. This is part of the workaround; only partnering with a woman whose astro profile is like a key to my lock, and vice verse. It promises to be a very loving, sensitive, passionate, and dynamic relationship! 

Me: Basically, I am a highly sensitive, primarily spiritually-minded, creative, dreamer-type, gentle, caring, intense, brainy, fun, funny, deep, multicultural, multi-ethnic transwoman of color. I am a very youthful older woman, in my late 50's. [I am inherently outgoing, but I have been deeply harmed, and I live with clinical depression, frequently fearing social interaction, to the extent of preferring to live in the shadows; the image is a good representation of that.] I am (an Internet-based) professional, and I do a lot of business in Asia, and New Zealand, so I work at night, and need a nocturnal-oriented partner. My most consistent demeanor is kind, gentle, mysterious, and somehow, not of this world.

I avoid opening myself up to intimate relationships with white, and Jewish women; based on too many adverse experiences with them, as groups. Otherwise, ethnicity is irrelevant; although I really DO have a heart thing for Native American, Japanese, (Western) French and Persian women. 

I have weak knees for tall women, i.e. 5'10""+. I tend to regard short women only as friends. Otherwise, my description of you generally applies to me too; older women are more substance-oriented, then sensation-oriented--one of the best reasons for younger women to be with us--so pardon the pun, the list is substantial.

You: 
[Most Important!] Your primary motivation in life is to attain the highest degree of Holiness that you may, and you live for Love's sake, more than any other reason--and that includes having a dedicated yoga, meditation, and spiritual practice; #
you are very sure, and solid in your own ""positions"" , and are not threatened by positions of others that may be inconsistent with yours;
you are serious, but not too serious to be unable to laugh at yourself;
you know how to get in touch with, and talk about your feelings, rather than relying on emotional outbursts to let your partner know something is not copacetic; 
you although assertive, you are not into being dominant; 
you live creatively, and don't need to take the same route anywhere twice in a row; 
you would rather cuddle, and listen to fantasy stories on audiobook, than go to any sports event--I don't EVER wish to hear more than a few seconds of sports broadcasts when we're together; 
you are a professional, if not typically, then creatively, or both; 
you have no STDs, dogs, psychotic ex-girlfriends, or queer-hatin' family; 
you are very, very affectionate, with words, and touch, [publicly is not necessary]; 
you are physically attractive, thin, (and into being thin), and good looking, with zero conceit, or narcissism; 
you are romantically inclined toward well-educated, spiritually-minded, women of color, with beautiful eyes, and smiles, long dark hair, and dark, soft, smooth skin; 
420 is fine, but you don't drink alcohol, or do narcotics. 
you love passionately, and not jealously;
you like to kiss, every part of your lover's body;
you are assertive, not shy, even if you are reserved in your demeanor;
you speak multiple languages;
you prefer to hang out with people from other cultures before criticizing them;
you read poetry aloud, with the sexiest, most seductive voice;
you are 5'8""+ tall;
for you, going to church/temple in your pajamas is fine; and 
you were born on one of the following dates;

-- November Twenty-fifth through
December Twenty-first, Nineteen Seventy-two;
-- October Ninth through
December Thirteenth, Nineteen Seventy-four;
-- October Nine through
November Fourteenth, Nineteen Seventy-six;
-- September Twenty through Thirty,
October, November, December One through Twelve, Nineteen Seventy-eight;
-- November, Twenty through Twenty-eight, Nineteen Seventy-nine;
-- October Five through Thirty, Nineteen Eighty;
-- October Twenty-two through Thirty-one,
November One through Five, Nineteen Eighty-one;
-- September Eighth through Thirtieth,
October First, Second, Twenty-seven through Thirty-one, Nineteen Eighty-two;
-- October Six through
November Ninth, Nineteen Eighty-three; or
-- January Twelve through Twenty-fifth, Nineteen Eighty-four.

So, that being said, if you fit this profile, and are looking for someone like me, we have a very good start to an incredible relationship, that may become the stuff of movies. Maybe not the movie stuff, but, the odds are stacked in our favor; so,

how adventurous are you?

I prefer to meet in person, rather than to go through email changes leading to nothing. Respond to this post, with a conversation, rather than a one line, ""Hit me up!"" type of message. Use an original subject line that represents your individuality, and you'll get my attention. Start a deep, interesting conversation that we may continue in person, and you may get my phone number. Meet up with me, and you may get more.




Zero intimate attraction toward males here, so men, don't waste your time trying to connect with me.
Not into HWP, thick, or BBW women as intimacy partners.
Zero tolerance for any kind of abusive behavior; if I perceive it as a pattern, I will leave you.

I want to kiss someone and make them feel good.
I've always liked learning and I think i'm a good learner. Lately i've been having the urge to kiss someone and have hit a really annoying wall. I have no one to kiss and I have never actually kissed someone.
Kissing isn't hard i'm pretty sure I know how to do it. What I could really use is a volunteer to teach me quickly and efficiently.
Let's make it happen! We can get pervy
NO NO men No couples.

-I can travel via muni
-if you can host then thats really neat.

Hey queer cuties,

My hot queer cis lady lover and I (queer trans guy) are looking for a cute toy to use. We are both in our early 30's, super communicative and generally sexy fuckers. 

We've got a lot of ideas (and are open to yours) but we really want to fuck all your holes, hard and for a long time. We'd also likely give you a good spanking. 

You: queer of some sort. Ready to bottom. Easy going, communicative and respectful of boundaries.

I'm addicted to the paranormal and supernatural, and a huge animal lover. I work as a vet tech for my career. I love getting tattooed, horseback riding, cuddling, and going to the beach or forest with my dogs. 
I'm attracted to anybody female, body type, age, looks, race is irrelevant. The only stipulations is you must be an animal lover, and body mods are highly attractive to me.

It's one thing to want something casual, to think one night stands are all you need. It's another thing to know you want a profound bond, to find someone that you just get and who gets you. That's what I want. I want a love like you read in a storybook, perfectly imperfect and made for each other. 

Pleased to meet you. A little more about me, I'm twenty four pretty nice looking I suppose, though i don't base much on that. Curvy and thick in stature, half Japanese half white. I'm a comic book nerd, and supernatural fanatic. I write and read, crochet and paint. I'll try anything once.

Hi! I am from Mexico. I'm 26 years old in a good shape! I love doing exercises. 
I am looking for a beautiful person that enjoys to go outside, watching a movie at the movie theater, do crazy stuff to make beautiful moments. I love to go to the beach, especially at nights and hear the sound of the waves, to feel the air, and hug and kiss the person who is driving me crazy in a good way. 
I always show how much I love someone. I like walking and get a coffee outside and talk and laugh about different topics. But also, I can stay at home all day if you want, hugging you, drink the coffee at home, bring the food in your bed. I'm just a very romantic person! And I always going to make you feel very special.

There's four things that I only going to ask:
1.- No big girls (Weight) 
2.- No masculine girls, only very feminine.
3.- I don't do cyber sex, so, if you are horny, go and look for someone else. 
4.- No more then 40. 

If you have one of this, please, don't text me back, I'm not going to replay the email if you have some of this. I just don't want you to waste my time and your time. 
Thank you. Have a beautiful night. :)

benefits??

I'm looking for a friendship. Someone to go out with or just chill with me. 
I'm really just looking for a women's company. I want a friend to be just that and maybe a little moore.. like kiss, cuddle, and just enjoy each other's presence. Someone I can be a dork or goofy with when the time is right. Just friends is fine as well. Just give me a heads up that you rather keep it strictly platonic so there will be no expectations. 

Don't care about your race although I love Latinas. No one extremely heavy. Be at least a cutie. I'm a size 12-14 depending on where I shop. I know no one is perfect. I'm not judgmental at all just that there needs to be attraction if more than friends. Have something going for yourself whether it's school or being a hard worker. I don't have a type. What matters is that we enjoy each other company. Preferably over 21 and under 33 please. If you do not plan on ever meeting up please do not reply. I'm not looking for a text or email pal. I will be HOPING you do want to meet up sooner rather than later. I have my own car, don't hit me up if all you're looking for is rides. Not happening, unless dinero is involved Ha ha jk. 

If you,'re looking for similar and interested in getting to know each other send me an email. Make sure to include your pic(no nudes) and a little about yourself(anything). I will send a pic of myself back. If you like to take things further we can exchange numbers. Don't mind voice verifying right away if needed. Hope to hear from you soon. :)

PLEASE DO NOT reply if all you're interested in is sex.

Hey girls! Just looking for one person to hang out and chat with. I am attracted to girls but since I've only been to the States for a year and a half, I don't have many female friends, which I realize guys can't substitute. So I thought I'd give CL a try. 

I'd like to get to know someone who's drug-free, easy-going, friendly, open-minded and active. Because I myself am. And whom I could call out on a dance party or a dinner time cooking at my/your place, who I could visit frequently and talk about random stuff and about life and family. I am very open-minded and stable, I love new experiences and learning new things. Although I am not particularly looking for sexual experience, I'd like to keep that open if there's real chemistry. I prefer you're around my age, active, in shape. Most importantly, someone who enjoys life and lots of positive energy. 

I like being in nature, hiking, excercising and just being active in general, I'm a competitive swimmer and I like doing lots of arts and music and a variety of other stuff. My strength is that I never get depressed over long period of time, I always seem to manage to make myself happy. I love singing, dancing, writing (songs), playing the guitar/piano/drum. I'm talented at doing most things but haven't seem to find something I'm truly passionate about that make me want to stick with. I'm a very positive person.

Anyway, I'd love to hearing back from you gals! Get back to me with a picture of your pretty self and a brief introduction to your self, including what do you love to do on weekends. AND... your favorite country to visit and why. Please be willing to meet in person, as I'm not into cyber friends. *without info above will be ignored. one-liners, men, perverts don't waste time replying

And yep that's me in the picture. I'm from China, speak Mandarin, English fluently, learning Spanish, French. Plus if you speak another language.

I don't know much about how these craigslist sites work but I wanted to give it a try.
I am not looking for a one night stand, nor am I looking to be in a friends with benefits relationship. I'm honestly looking for someone who I can relate and talk to, individuals who have common interests and ideas that can lead into a blooming friendship. It would be nice to go out and explore the city as I am fairly new to the bay area. If you consider me visiting the touristy spots already... does that make me a local? ( getting used to it though! haha)
Ive noticed a lot of the posts here on craigslist are mostly booty calls.. Please, do not mistake this post as one. Ladies, respect yourself :) no need for nudes or anything like that. I'm more of a old school ""Let's get to know one another"" chemistry type of person. Anyways...

Some things about me:

I really love poetry. I write a lot of it myself, sometimes I publish them on blogger.

I write songs.

I play musical instruments such as violin and guitar. I currently own 4 guitars haha,but because of space I only brought 1 guitar with me here in SF. 

I LOVE music.. Not much of a picky eater when it comes to listening to different genres of music.

I find passion in cooking- can be a klutz and a crazed scientist at times. (I love seeing people react to the tastes that i create when i cook them something) #chef goals

I'm a college student majoring in Hospitality.

Very into gaming: cod, rs, maplestory, horror games etc. If you play TWOM (the world of magic) let me know hahaha... It's like a new hobby for me. #devilangSiras ;D

Very into Photography and lover of scenery... Nature is beautiful, urban cities are like a jungle.

I find leisure in simple things: art, drawing, fishing, etc
(I have crab nets if you'd like to go crabbing with me some time at pacifica)

Very adventurous and loves to try new things: food, culture, literature

Anime interests me

very avid believer in equality, human rights, LGBTQ rights etc.

book worm all day ""err'day""

Timid at times, shy at first, but very outgoing once you get to know me

I like to be spontaneous and i usually bring up random corny jokes

I'm transgender meaning im a guy on the inside but have the wrong body.. FTM.. (hopefully ill be able to transition soon ^__^ )

im asian :) 

Please don't bring your bullshit to me. Drama is for the faint of heart. 

Would love to have a nice hang out with you one day.

I'm a very modern Japanese woman, a linguist, a rare breed indeed. I taught English to university students and corporate salary men in Tokyo. I am Oxford educated. Currently. I am on assignment in San Francisco and love the city. I intend to stay with or without my current employer. I am confident I can find work in this City with my skills.

In addition to the aforementioned professional profile, I enjoy things Japanese. I may be jaded, and biased, but I simply hold all things Japanese slightly superior: food, clothing, sensibilities, art, etc. Feel free to prove me otherwise. I'd love to explore other cultures, other sub-cultures and more.

Ideally, I'd like to date/play with an All-American Girl type, whatever that really means, but someone who is the epitome of the Women in the United States of America.

I am not experienced in dating women. I am seeking someone around the age of 30 to date for a long term relationship. I am an alternative thinker.

Hi!
I'm 25, femme, bisexual, curvy, and cute. I'm a full time student studying history. 

I'm in an open relationship and looking looking to expand my horizons romantically. Seriously hoping to establish a connection with someone special, not looking for one night stands or perpetual fwb. This is my first attempt at a poly-type relationship but I'm very interested in giving it a try with the right person. I don't expect much from CL but you never know, right?

I'm a total closet geek; I read manga, watch anime, get excited over the latest scifi movie or show, have a bit of a thing for zombies, enjoy board games, and am a social gamer (though I'm terrible at video games and don't personally own any consoles). I enjoy the outdoors, whether it's wandering the streets of sf or aimlessly wandering the woods somewhere (Marin county has the best hiking spots!!). I'm a foodie and love going to new restaurants as well as frequenting the ones I already love; brunch on the weekend is a must! I like sipping cocktails at fancy bars, looking at cool things in museums/ art galleries, and am almost always happy to go on a random adventure. I'm a kinky bottom leaning switch (who flip-flops about her sub status on the regular) and just looking to meet a girl who shares some of my interests!

I'm interested in ladies in their 20's and early 30's only. Ideally seeking a lady in an established poly relationship or two but totally willing to give things a go with someone as new as I am. It's a plus if you happen to also be a kinkster (as I am and have been for 6 years) but it's fine if you're not.

I don't want to be your unicorn or have a relationship that only involves sex. I posted in the romance section for a reason; I want to go on cute dates and cultivate a loving relationship. Sex is not my priority so please don't bother to reply if it's yours.

If you're interested, feel free to send me an email telling me a little about yourself.

I love younger femme submissive cis women, with a good sense of humor, independant, honest, and open-minded. Tend to be attracted to girls smaller than me, size 16 or under. Will need to voice verify within 48 hrs, I am not looking for games, drama, or wasted time.

I'm bi poly and a BBW, have many years of BDSM experience, am nurturing, sexual, and down to earth. I do not smoke or do ANY drugs, and neither should you.

Imagine the day we stop hiding our fierce and beautiful spirituality.

Imagine choosing to step out and accept our commitment to living a conscious and intentional life.

Imagine relationships more than a fleeting pass-time as we unconsciously or consciously prep for the next.

Imagine a wife/partner/friend as an opportunity to cultivate more love in the world.

Imagine meeting the one who feels similarly and has an unending passion to find the one who matches, if not, surpasses, her love of The Infinite.

Imagine what we could create together.
No limits, working through the hard moments, palatable closeness, exquisite intimacy, love making that would take us into worlds we've not yet traveled, and that would be the beginning...

A beginning that has no end...

I'm a high femme who is fat, extra-voluptuous, radically self-accepting, and attractive, and I'm looking for a compatible masculine-of-center queer.

I'm 41, white and critical about it, and very down-to-earth and real despite my hard-fighting high femme armor. Simultaneously, I'm a pretty heady and creative person who is most at home synthesizing meanings and creating new realities from ideas, art, music, and politics. I am slow to build intimacy and do best with relationships that are predicated on a strong friendship dynamic.

I'm looking for someone who is much more interested in prioritizing a collaborative intellectual and creative partnership than conventional marriage-family-kids. I'm interested in making stuff, separately and together. I'm more of a collectivist than an individualist and recreating the nuclear family is anathema to me, while I do love children and extended families beyond my four walls. 

Beyond this, I'm pretty open. Even if there isn't chemistry, I never consider friendship a failure, because my world is supported by a huge web of family and friends, and there's always room for more.

Please get in touch if you're interested!

Vibrant, vivacious and reflective are three words to describe me. 
Vibrant because I appreciate all the beauty in life, vivacious because I speak my mind and my native tongue is French, and reflective because I enjoy quiet times of listening to music and reading, or simply listening to the sound of silence, just being. 

I own my own business, massaging women who are pregnant, and teaching women how to massage their babies.

The woman who makes my heart skip a beat. The woman who brightens my day with a simple text, a call, her smile and laughter. The woman who is just a that a woman, and not because her age dictates it so, but a woman who knows that life is not a rigid stone but forever changing with what life throws our way. She is intelligent and caring and serious and silly. She is employed and content. She enjoys movies, and maybe has a favorite tv show and likes the outdoors. But a woman who has a life away from work and the couch and the computer. I consider myself a pretty laid back person, I try not to sweat the small stuff because in the grand scheme of things it's not worth it. I would rather spend my time letting the woman who has my heart know how I feel about her. I am not totally femme but also having some chapstick/softbutch traits if you will, and though I have mostly dated younger woman (within reason), I'm late 40s, I'm not closing myself off to any possibilities (within reason). I am pretty much open as to what I like to do for fun. If it seems like fun I will give it a go. I like to cook, watch movies, read, but most of all, I like to have good chats, even if it's about the silliest thing. I want to find someone I can be myself around and not have to change who I am as a person and I want her to be able to be exactly who she is. Isn't that what we are all looking for, someone who will love us for us? With that said, I do have preferences as I see most on here do. Mine are, she is feminine, average height, she has this aura about her that to me would make her beautiful. The arts, meditation, walks on the beach, City nights all intrigue me. Your pic gets mine.

I am looking to find someone who can love me and my daughter. 
I'm not into labels but for the sake of this ad, I'm like a combo between fem and butch?! I don't wear dresses or carry a purse, I have a shaved head, but I'm feminine all the way. 
I tend to be attracted to butch/androgyenous women but looks aren't incredibly important to me. A woman who can keep up with my wit and sarcastic humor is incredibly attractive to me! I need a good hearted woman who can make me laugh and have long conversations with. I also need someone who is not afraid to put themselves out there and take those first few steps. I spent too many years in a crappy relationship so I still find myself on the shy side sometimes. 
What I'm not interested in are men, couples or women who are ""curious"" I'm looking for that authentic woman to spend time with and hopefully something more... I hope to hear from you soon. :)

Hi,

My first time posting here. It's one of those times when you can't go to sleep and you wonder why is it that all my pretty close female friends don't live nearby or in the country? I gotta find me someone here. I'm 28, have my life together, not from the U.S., I have ambitions, goals that I'm making happen... but then there's that other side of me who wants to explore myself on a deeper level... I think I can use an attractive and confident woman to help me achieve that. You must be confident, secure, HOT, savvy, well cultured, outspoken and open minded. Open minded to explore yourself with me.. open minded to possibly travel, take risks in life, open minded to finding ways to improve each other's lives. That's when you know you found a good friend. When you add value to each other's lives. Last thing I'd like to say is, please don't be a flake, fake and personal hygiene is extremely important to me. It should be to you too. I look forward to meeting you, beautiful one! xo

Might as well state off the bat, to weed out unnecessary responses ha: I know this is a women seeking women ad, but no I don't want to be your curiosity satisfying, experimental lesbian fling.. so if that's what you want you should probably look elsewhere. Kay, great, now that's out of the way...

Hmm. never really know where to start with these.. name maybe? Yeah name is good. My name is Sarah. :P Kind of hard to summarize yourself, but I'll start with a few fun facts- I'm thoughtful, good-natured, bit of a goofball, I love conversing about pretty much anything from lighthearted to in depth so long as the dialogue flows, though awkward conversations can be fun and memorable as well. I'm a nature loving, ocean diving, animal loving flower child, and I enjoy a variety of music, so if you want a conversation starter feel free to ask about that- or be brave and tell me what you like first. :) Either way. I have a broad variety of activities I like, including but not limited to- hiking, swimming, daydreaming, reading, doodling, etcetera. I can be a pretty balanced blend of active and couch potato, which side comes out usually depends on who I'm hanging with. Anywho, I'm on here cause work is a bit of a time consumer, a big one actually, and its hard to meet up with people organically, hence giving this a go. I'd like to have someone special, or just new friends in general, to share new experiences with. Plus it'd be fantastic to meet more folks who fall under the lgbtq umbrella, though its cool to meet straight peeps as well, so long as you're engaging and all around respectful then it won't matter. I'm open to friends, a fwb's situation, or maybe a romantic partner, depending how we click. So if you feel we could potentially hit it off in any of these departments, don't be shy to message. Or, if you're naturally shy but feel a strong urge to contact me, then seize the moment bashful one! Haha. I'm pretty approachable, yunno, like I said, so long as you're respectful and all that jazz.. aka just don't be a jerk and we'll be cool. x)

When it comes to romantic/sexual interests, I'm looking for women ONLY, I can't stress that enough, but I feel like I have to press this, based on men trying to hit me up for dates and/or hookups, despite my interests being crystal clear. Guys, this is a woman seeks woman ad, c'mon now, you're barking up the wrong tree here. 

Moving on, where romantic interests are concerned, I'd like to talk to someone who is passionate about something, has some self confidence, someone who has a decent sense of humor, knows how to be respectful, is naturally an affectionate soul, and likes to go on adventures. Someone who is very comfortable with who they are. Looks wise I am not incredibly particular, I like an array of body types but mainly my attention is captivated by engaging personality and a cute face. :) I am on the thicker/curvier side so whoever is interested from a dating standpoint needs to be ok with that. 

Friends: Can be of any sex: anyone who can appreciate a sarcastic sense of humor and can give it back, in a fun and playful way, not a snide way. Someone who is supportive, real, laid back but also likes to go on adventures, as well. 

Deal breakers for me when it comes to romantic interests: Cigarette smokers, taking hard drugs, bad hygiene, lack of imagination/compassion/honesty. While we're on the topic of honesty- please be honest and communicative in regards to STD's, if we spend time and it reaches the point where intimacy seems like a likelihood between us. I'd prefer it to be a risk free experience entirely, but I understand fully that shit happens, and there's ways to play it safe under these circumstances. For the record I am clear in this area, and am willing to provide proof affirm this. 

Other deal-breakers, for FRIENDS, OR ROMANTIC INTERESTS: Having a sexist, violent, racist, or really, derogatory in any way, type of mindset. Just. Nope. Tryina steer clear of negativity here, folks!

If you are interested in seeing if a friendship or more can be sparked here, please send me a photo of you (keep it pg please,) along with the headline of ""FRIEND"" if you are interested in friendship, and ""SOMETHING MORE"" if you think we could have some chemistry, so I know you are real and I know what you are seeking. also I will be more eager to respond if you do this, cause it'll show you read my information and are actually interested in details. heads up, if you don't send me a picture i'll be less inclined to respond if we're being honest.

Additionally, please only message me if you are in or near Milpitas/San Jose or can make the trip here, ideally though I'd like to establish good connections with peeps (friends or otherwise,) that are in my area. To clarify, if you are interested in more than friendship, the age range I'm willing to date is 20-30... in some cases, 35 at the oldest. Please take that into account.

Another thing to take into account when messaging, make it a message that's worth replying to! I've had some thoughtful responses, but I've gotten my fair share of hi's and hey's, one worded responses don't do much for me. :P 

Thanks guys, let's make something happen here. :) 

Peace and well wishes. 



p.s. Dudes, if you send me a dick pic I will just laugh and proceed to delete it. Really, not trying to be harsh, but sending one to begin with is awkward especially in this context, and you would get nothing positive out of it. Again just to to reiterate, i'm open to a friendship with you if you are male however I'm only interested in dating women. 

p.s.s. I would like to disclose (since this has caused some confusion and conflict, though i don't know why) I identify as pansexual, feel free to look up the definition and ask me about it if you are confused, however if you are disrespectful about it we aren't going to get along. I am attracted to various genders and personalities, but at this point in time, i'm ONLY interested in women romantically, and I don't see that changing. Girls, if you are interested in me, great, but don't try to get me to change my orientation, or look down upon it. Guys, don't look at it as an opportunity to try to get in my pants cause it's not happening. Aaaand yeah, that long side note about covers it. Haha. 



do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers

I am a polyamorous girl in a Power exchange relationship. I am looking for a nice girl for fun and brunch and cuddles. You don't need to be kinky yourself, but it's a plus. You will need to be okay with my other partner/Daddy/Owner person. You would be free to also date him but it is not required. I like good food, dancing, and Hamilton! Come say hello :)
