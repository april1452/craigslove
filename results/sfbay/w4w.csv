Hello not a dating post but I have a quaint older 2 bedroom apartment

1 bathroom only shared with me. I am renting out the ""extra bedroom"" 

including all utilities, WIFI, etc. It's a smaller bedroom totally furnished

with a twin bed. It has a large walk-in closet. it's an upstairs unit 1 flight 

of stairs and fairly very quiet tenants. There is a washer/dryer in building.

I will not be in your face or your business I ask the same. No overnight 

guests unit too small. The rent is great $850.00 and Bart is 2 blocks away. 

Trader Joe's the works, light cooking please. $400. deposit. On street 

parking could be half to one block away. Sunshine Gardens not foggy like 

near Tanforan or Daly City at all.

So, this may sound pretty weird but I am so tired of dating and meeting people who 1) have some sort of catch (they're married, not over their ex, or are pregnant..I know I have bad luck with women apparently) 

I'm REALLY looking for someone to settle down with. I am 23 but have an old soul, I know what I want and who I am, I've done all my partying in my teen years (quite a lot, over it). The problem is I keep meeting people who aren't ready to settle down, or don't have the ultimate goal of getting married. I don't mean to sound unattractive by complaining, I just want to make the point that I am seeking a woman who is willing to pursue me in the hopes of settling down with me (WITHOUT crazy baggage). 
I'm going to be up front, if I like you I'm not very good at taking things slow. I like affection, I like reminding my girl how amazing she is all the time and apparently that is too much for some people to handle. I fall hard, which I recognize is a flaw but am seeking someone who is equally excited about me as I am them. Someone passionate, a hopeless romantic like myself. 

Now that we have that out of the way..

About me: 
23 
Full time employed by a MAJOR social networking site (not going to post which one, but feel free to ask) 
Introverted, I prefer snuggling up and watching a movie to clubbing any day. 
Enjoys being called daddy in bed (Just to get that out of the way haha) 
REALLY into physics, philosophy, psychology and deep conversations 
Working on getting sleeve tattoos, I have some big ones on my arms already.
5''6 
I do volunteer work, I love to help others!
Really (and obviously) sick of the dating scene. I am sure I will get some smart ass emails, but whatever. 
I love to write and read! #Nerd power
I play guitar, used to be in a punk band. 
Suuuuper romantic. 


If you're looking for someone who doesn't play games and is ready for something real and long term (and you think we'd be a good match) email me with a photo and some information about yourself. Let's go on a date! 

I'm really into androgynous women, so points if you fit that!

I'm looking for some lesbian, bi girl friends (ok, straight girls welcome too). In a relationship or single is OK with me. Just looking for different types of connections: platonic friends, fwb, hiking buddy, book nerd, weekend trip friend, texting only friend, etc. I'm pretty open minded so let's chat and see if there's a connection and see where it goes. Life is too short not to explore options. Plus, there are so many wonderful people in this world that it would be a shame not to try and meet someone new every once in a while. 

I'm 34, Mexican, femme to sporty spectrum, have a 4 year degree and a great career that I love. I enjoy hiking, random road trips and adventures, massages(giving and receiving), running, concerts, museums, trying new restaurants or recipes, I like going out (trust me...I can still party pretty hard), but I prefer intimate nights in with no TV, no cell phone, no distractions....just me and my friend being present, in the moment, and getting to know each other on a deeper level. 

Age is not important to me. It's what's inside that matters and if there's a connection. However, I have a weak spot for Latinas and other women of color with tomboy to feminine qualities who are curvy (at or above a size 8/10 and no more than size 18/20). 
If interested, send me a message and we'll see where this goes. Or reach me at Four 1Five, 6Eight _nine, eighty '99! 

Willing to travel around the Bay area for the right connection. I love exploring new places & enjoy driving.

[ABSOLUTELY NO MEN/COUPLES/DRUGS/STDs]

If love was a gamble, then I'd be a gambler.
If love was a poison that rips up my heart...
Sending piercing pain and joy into my veins...
Then, girl, I'll be happy to take that shot for you.
If love let me fall deeply for you;
Let me snuggle you with sweet embrace;
Let us make music and melodies with our moans of ecstasy,
Then, my God, let me fall in love.
Let me fall deeply in an all-consuming love;
My soul, my mind, and my body are yours.
Days, hours, minutes, seconds--I will be thinking of you;
Of your soft lips gliding down my neck and my hands gently teasing your torso;
Or the countless of times you whisper my name, and I yours;
Or the endless silent conversations that we have where no one spoke, but it was more than enough...

Me: Asian, lesbian, hopeless romantic, trustworthy, loyal, ambitious, great cook, great cuddler, tech-savvy, gamer, amateur guitarist, amateur poet, loves the outdoors, loves animals, wants to be a butterfly one day (ask me about it), wants a family (be it with kids or adopted animals), prefers tea over coffee. 

You: FEMALE, SINGLE, 23-28 years old, Caucasian/Asian, confident, independent, health conscious, down to earth, the girl next door, an adventurer, shy but also has a crazy side that yearns to be free, has an idea of what you want to do in life (doesn't have to be set in stone), wants more than a one night stand, can hold a conversation, am interested in me and will put in the effort to get to know me (I will do the same).

Respond to email with: the title of your favorite Movie/TV Series attached with a picture of you. Keep it PG.

I am a lesbian and looking to share a bright and private 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom apartment. The apartment is located in San Mateo, a short distance from the Hillsdale Caltrain Station, Highway 101 & Highway 92. I posted here but am not looking to date my room mate; only get the word out to a broader lesbian audience as this is a fabulous deal I think! :-)
The move-in date is April 1, 2016 [no fooling]; the monthly rent is ~ $1,600, this includes shared utilities.The leasing office does require running a background check which is $42. The leasing period is 15 months.
You would just need to furnish your own bedroom and some things in the living and kitchen area if need be.
I have 2 cats, I enjoy swimming, biking, long walks along the beach, visiting with friends & family, and new adventures. I am easy going and do enjoy privacy at times. If you are interested in talking about this opportunity, please respond to this posting. Thank you!

Have been single for quite a long time after a while you say is this all

there is? As we mature growing older many people tend to fade away in 

one way or another sometimes we find ourselves craving more as in 

companionship with a kind person that enjoys the ""simplicity"" of life........

No expectations of the 4TH of July on a daily basis. Not seeking turmoil 

laced with drama been there done that we will give that to someone else that

may wish to partake..........I like doing the walks, movies, junking a bit and 

much more.............can you teach me a few things life is always a process of 

learning and growth. Please be willing to share some of your time if you want 

a little companionship and a person to cuddle up with do reply. I'm told I am 

attractive but that's for someone else to decide. Please be 50's to 65 years 

of age. I look fit and I do take care of myself. Let me reiterate ""seeking simplicity""

I am not a white water rafter nor do I scale mountains but I do exercise, I walk tall

in shape but I am ""petite"" and still very capable of very long walks......... I think

my issue with extreme sports at this point is injury I would like to avoid!

Please no smokers.......I am 100% lesbian....like forever. This is safe not a scam or

anything to fear so take a step forward.

Buongiorno, 

Generally, I am interested in the person, not in their astrology, however, for this, I am solely relying on astrology to sharply narrow my options; particularly the possibility of being hurt due to some fundamental astro incompatibilities. Granted there are many things in life, other than astrological compatibility, that count for something, in relationships, however, who I am looking for is special. The relationship I am opening myself to be a part of is also special, and somewhat date specific. After decades of attracting the wrong type of women, I finally got into astrology, clearly saw why, and clearly saw the workaround. This is part of the workaround; only partnering with a woman whose astro profile is like a key to my lock, and vice verse. It promises to be a very loving, sensitive, passionate, and dynamic relationship! 

Me: Basically, I am a highly sensitive, primarily spiritually-minded, creative, dreamer-type, gentle, caring, intense, brainy, fun, funny, deep, multicultural, multi-ethnic transwoman of color. I am a very youthful older woman, in my late 50's. [I am inherently outgoing, but I have been deeply harmed, and I live with clinical depression, frequently fearing social interaction, to the extent of preferring to live in the shadows; the image is a good representation of that.] I am (an Internet-based) professional, and I do a lot of business in Asia, and New Zealand, so I work at night, and need a nocturnal-oriented partner. My most consistent demeanor is kind, gentle, mysterious, and somehow, not of this world.

I avoid opening myself up to intimate relationships with white, and Jewish women; based on too many adverse experiences with them, as groups. Otherwise, ethnicity is irrelevant; although I really DO have a heart thing for Native American, Japanese, (Western) French and Persian women. 

I have weak knees for tall women, i.e. 5'10""+. I tend to regard short women only as friends. Otherwise, my description of you generally applies to me too; older women are more substance-oriented, then sensation-oriented--one of the best reasons for younger women to be with us--so pardon the pun, the list is substantial.

You: 
[Most Important!] Your primary motivation in life is to attain the highest degree of Holiness that you may, and you live for Love's sake, more than any other reason--and that includes having a dedicated yoga, meditation, and spiritual practice; #
you are very sure, and solid in your own ""positions"" , and are not threatened by positions of others that may be inconsistent with yours;
you are serious, but not too serious to be unable to laugh at yourself;
you know how to get in touch with, and talk about your feelings, rather than relying on emotional outbursts to let your partner know something is not copacetic; 
you although assertive, you are not into being dominant; 
you live creatively, and don't need to take the same route anywhere twice in a row; 
you would rather cuddle, and listen to fantasy stories on audiobook, than go to any sports event--I don't EVER wish to hear more than a few seconds of sports broadcasts when we're together; 
you are a professional, if not typically, then creatively, or both; 
you have no STDs, dogs, psychotic ex-girlfriends, or queer-hatin' family; 
you are very, very affectionate, with words, and touch, [publicly is not necessary]; 
you are physically attractive, thin, (and into being thin), and good looking, with zero conceit, or narcissism; 
you are romantically inclined toward well-educated, spiritually-minded, women of color, with beautiful eyes, and smiles, long dark hair, and dark, soft, smooth skin; 
420 is fine, but you don't drink alcohol, or do narcotics. 
you love passionately, and not jealously;
you like to kiss, every part of your lover's body;
you are assertive, not shy, even if you are reserved in your demeanor;
you speak multiple languages;
you prefer to hang out with people from other cultures before criticizing them;
you read poetry aloud, with the sexiest, most seductive voice;
you are 5'8""+ tall;
for you, going to church/temple in your pajamas is fine; and 
you were born on one of the following dates;

-- November Twenty-fifth through
December Twenty-first, Nineteen Seventy-two;
-- October Ninth through
December Thirteenth, Nineteen Seventy-four;
-- October Nine through
November Fourteenth, Nineteen Seventy-six;
-- September Twenty through Thirty,
October, November, December One through Twelve, Nineteen Seventy-eight;
-- November, Twenty through Twenty-eight, Nineteen Seventy-nine;
-- October Five through Thirty, Nineteen Eighty;
-- October Twenty-two through Thirty-one,
November One through Five, Nineteen Eighty-one;
-- September Eighth through Thirtieth,
October First, Second, Twenty-seven through Thirty-one, Nineteen Eighty-two;
-- October Six through
November Ninth, Nineteen Eighty-three; or
-- January Twelve through Twenty-fifth, Nineteen Eighty-four.

So, that being said, if you fit this profile, and are looking for someone like me, we have a very good start to an incredible relationship, that may become the stuff of movies. Maybe not the movie stuff, but, the odds are stacked in our favor; so,

how adventurous are you?

I prefer to meet in person, rather than to go through email changes leading to nothing. Respond to this post, with a conversation, rather than a one line, ""Hit me up!"" type of message. Use an original subject line that represents your individuality, and you'll get my attention. Start a deep, interesting conversation that we may continue in person, and you may get my phone number. Meet up with me, and you may get more.




Zero intimate attraction toward males here, so men, don't waste your time trying to connect with me.
Not into HWP, thick, or BBW women as intimacy partners.
Zero tolerance for any kind of abusive behavior; if I perceive it as a pattern, I will leave you.

I want to kiss someone and make them feel good.
I've always liked learning and I think i'm a good learner. Lately i've been having the urge to kiss someone and have hit a really annoying wall. I have no one to kiss and I have never actually kissed someone.
Kissing isn't hard i'm pretty sure I know how to do it. What I could really use is a volunteer to teach me quickly and efficiently.
Let's make it happen! We can get pervy
NO NO men No couples.

-I can travel via muni
-if you can host then thats really neat.

Hey queer cuties,

My hot queer cis lady lover and I (queer trans guy) are looking for a cute toy to use. We are both in our early 30's, super communicative and generally sexy fuckers. 

We've got a lot of ideas (and are open to yours) but we really want to fuck all your holes, hard and for a long time. We'd also likely give you a good spanking. 

You: queer of some sort. Ready to bottom. Easy going, communicative and respectful of boundaries.

I'm addicted to the paranormal and supernatural, and a huge animal lover. I work as a vet tech for my career. I love getting tattooed, horseback riding, cuddling, and going to the beach or forest with my dogs. 
I'm attracted to anybody female, body type, age, looks, race is irrelevant. The only stipulations is you must be an animal lover, and body mods are highly attractive to me.

It's one thing to want something casual, to think one night stands are all you need. It's another thing to know you want a profound bond, to find someone that you just get and who gets you. That's what I want. I want a love like you read in a storybook, perfectly imperfect and made for each other. 

Pleased to meet you. A little more about me, I'm twenty four pretty nice looking I suppose, though i don't base much on that. Curvy and thick in stature, half Japanese half white. I'm a comic book nerd, and supernatural fanatic. I write and read, crochet and paint. I'll try anything once.

Hi! I am from Mexico. I'm 26 years old in a good shape! I love doing exercises. 
I am looking for a beautiful person that enjoys to go outside, watching a movie at the movie theater, do crazy stuff to make beautiful moments. I love to go to the beach, especially at nights and hear the sound of the waves, to feel the air, and hug and kiss the person who is driving me crazy in a good way. 
I always show how much I love someone. I like walking and get a coffee outside and talk and laugh about different topics. But also, I can stay at home all day if you want, hugging you, drink the coffee at home, bring the food in your bed. I'm just a very romantic person! And I always going to make you feel very special.

There's four things that I only going to ask:
1.- No big girls (Weight) 
2.- No masculine girls, only very feminine.
3.- I don't do cyber sex, so, if you are horny, go and look for someone else. 
4.- No more then 40. 

If you have one of this, please, don't text me back, I'm not going to replay the email if you have some of this. I just don't want you to waste my time and your time. 
Thank you. Have a beautiful night. :)

benefits??

I'm looking for a friendship. Someone to go out with or just chill with me. 
I'm really just looking for a women's company. I want a friend to be just that and maybe a little moore.. like kiss, cuddle, and just enjoy each other's presence. Someone I can be a dork or goofy with when the time is right. Just friends is fine as well. Just give me a heads up that you rather keep it strictly platonic so there will be no expectations. 

Don't care about your race although I love Latinas. No one extremely heavy. Be at least a cutie. I'm a size 12-14 depending on where I shop. I know no one is perfect. I'm not judgmental at all just that there needs to be attraction if more than friends. Have something going for yourself whether it's school or being a hard worker. I don't have a type. What matters is that we enjoy each other company. Preferably over 21 and under 33 please. If you do not plan on ever meeting up please do not reply. I'm not looking for a text or email pal. I will be HOPING you do want to meet up sooner rather than later. I have my own car, don't hit me up if all you're looking for is rides. Not happening, unless dinero is involved Ha ha jk. 

If you,'re looking for similar and interested in getting to know each other send me an email. Make sure to include your pic(no nudes) and a little about yourself(anything). I will send a pic of myself back. If you like to take things further we can exchange numbers. Don't mind voice verifying right away if needed. Hope to hear from you soon. :)

PLEASE DO NOT reply if all you're interested in is sex.

Hey girls! Just looking for one person to hang out and chat with. I am attracted to girls but since I've only been to the States for a year and a half, I don't have many female friends, which I realize guys can't substitute. So I thought I'd give CL a try. 

I'd like to get to know someone who's drug-free, easy-going, friendly, open-minded and active. Because I myself am. And whom I could call out on a dance party or a dinner time cooking at my/your place, who I could visit frequently and talk about random stuff and about life and family. I am very open-minded and stable, I love new experiences and learning new things. Although I am not particularly looking for sexual experience, I'd like to keep that open if there's real chemistry. I prefer you're around my age, active, in shape. Most importantly, someone who enjoys life and lots of positive energy. 

I like being in nature, hiking, excercising and just being active in general, I'm a competitive swimmer and I like doing lots of arts and music and a variety of other stuff. My strength is that I never get depressed over long period of time, I always seem to manage to make myself happy. I love singing, dancing, writing (songs), playing the guitar/piano/drum. I'm talented at doing most things but haven't seem to find something I'm truly passionate about that make me want to stick with. I'm a very positive person.

Anyway, I'd love to hearing back from you gals! Get back to me with a picture of your pretty self and a brief introduction to your self, including what do you love to do on weekends. AND... your favorite country to visit and why. Please be willing to meet in person, as I'm not into cyber friends. *without info above will be ignored. one-liners, men, perverts don't waste time replying

And yep that's me in the picture. I'm from China, speak Mandarin, English fluently, learning Spanish, French. Plus if you speak another language.

I don't know much about how these craigslist sites work but I wanted to give it a try.
I am not looking for a one night stand, nor am I looking to be in a friends with benefits relationship. I'm honestly looking for someone who I can relate and talk to, individuals who have common interests and ideas that can lead into a blooming friendship. It would be nice to go out and explore the city as I am fairly new to the bay area. If you consider me visiting the touristy spots already... does that make me a local? ( getting used to it though! haha)
Ive noticed a lot of the posts here on craigslist are mostly booty calls.. Please, do not mistake this post as one. Ladies, respect yourself :) no need for nudes or anything like that. I'm more of a old school ""Let's get to know one another"" chemistry type of person. Anyways...

Some things about me:

I really love poetry. I write a lot of it myself, sometimes I publish them on blogger.

I write songs.

I play musical instruments such as violin and guitar. I currently own 4 guitars haha,but because of space I only brought 1 guitar with me here in SF. 

I LOVE music.. Not much of a picky eater when it comes to listening to different genres of music.

I find passion in cooking- can be a klutz and a crazed scientist at times. (I love seeing people react to the tastes that i create when i cook them something) #chef goals

I'm a college student majoring in Hospitality.

Very into gaming: cod, rs, maplestory, horror games etc. If you play TWOM (the world of magic) let me know hahaha... It's like a new hobby for me. #devilangSiras ;D

Very into Photography and lover of scenery... Nature is beautiful, urban cities are like a jungle.

I find leisure in simple things: art, drawing, fishing, etc
(I have crab nets if you'd like to go crabbing with me some time at pacifica)

Very adventurous and loves to try new things: food, culture, literature

Anime interests me

very avid believer in equality, human rights, LGBTQ rights etc.

book worm all day ""err'day""

Timid at times, shy at first, but very outgoing once you get to know me

I like to be spontaneous and i usually bring up random corny jokes

I'm transgender meaning im a guy on the inside but have the wrong body.. FTM.. (hopefully ill be able to transition soon ^__^ )

im asian :) 

Please don't bring your bullshit to me. Drama is for the faint of heart. 

Would love to have a nice hang out with you one day.

I'm a very modern Japanese woman, a linguist, a rare breed indeed. I taught English to university students and corporate salary men in Tokyo. I am Oxford educated. Currently. I am on assignment in San Francisco and love the city. I intend to stay with or without my current employer. I am confident I can find work in this City with my skills.

In addition to the aforementioned professional profile, I enjoy things Japanese. I may be jaded, and biased, but I simply hold all things Japanese slightly superior: food, clothing, sensibilities, art, etc. Feel free to prove me otherwise. I'd love to explore other cultures, other sub-cultures and more.

Ideally, I'd like to date/play with an All-American Girl type, whatever that really means, but someone who is the epitome of the Women in the United States of America.

I am not experienced in dating women. I am seeking someone around the age of 30 to date for a long term relationship. I am an alternative thinker.

Hi!
I'm 25, femme, bisexual, curvy, and cute. I'm a full time student studying history. 

I'm in an open relationship and looking looking to expand my horizons romantically. Seriously hoping to establish a connection with someone special, not looking for one night stands or perpetual fwb. This is my first attempt at a poly-type relationship but I'm very interested in giving it a try with the right person. I don't expect much from CL but you never know, right?

I'm a total closet geek; I read manga, watch anime, get excited over the latest scifi movie or show, have a bit of a thing for zombies, enjoy board games, and am a social gamer (though I'm terrible at video games and don't personally own any consoles). I enjoy the outdoors, whether it's wandering the streets of sf or aimlessly wandering the woods somewhere (Marin county has the best hiking spots!!). I'm a foodie and love going to new restaurants as well as frequenting the ones I already love; brunch on the weekend is a must! I like sipping cocktails at fancy bars, looking at cool things in museums/ art galleries, and am almost always happy to go on a random adventure. I'm a kinky bottom leaning switch (who flip-flops about her sub status on the regular) and just looking to meet a girl who shares some of my interests!

I'm interested in ladies in their 20's and early 30's only. Ideally seeking a lady in an established poly relationship or two but totally willing to give things a go with someone as new as I am. It's a plus if you happen to also be a kinkster (as I am and have been for 6 years) but it's fine if you're not.

I don't want to be your unicorn or have a relationship that only involves sex. I posted in the romance section for a reason; I want to go on cute dates and cultivate a loving relationship. Sex is not my priority so please don't bother to reply if it's yours.

If you're interested, feel free to send me an email telling me a little about yourself.

I love younger femme submissive cis women, with a good sense of humor, independant, honest, and open-minded. Tend to be attracted to girls smaller than me, size 16 or under. Will need to voice verify within 48 hrs, I am not looking for games, drama, or wasted time.

I'm bi poly and a BBW, have many years of BDSM experience, am nurturing, sexual, and down to earth. I do not smoke or do ANY drugs, and neither should you.

Imagine the day we stop hiding our fierce and beautiful spirituality.

Imagine choosing to step out and accept our commitment to living a conscious and intentional life.

Imagine relationships more than a fleeting pass-time as we unconsciously or consciously prep for the next.

Imagine a wife/partner/friend as an opportunity to cultivate more love in the world.

Imagine meeting the one who feels similarly and has an unending passion to find the one who matches, if not, surpasses, her love of The Infinite.

Imagine what we could create together.
No limits, working through the hard moments, palatable closeness, exquisite intimacy, love making that would take us into worlds we've not yet traveled, and that would be the beginning...

A beginning that has no end...

I'm a high femme who is fat, extra-voluptuous, radically self-accepting, and attractive, and I'm looking for a compatible masculine-of-center queer.

I'm 41, white and critical about it, and very down-to-earth and real despite my hard-fighting high femme armor. Simultaneously, I'm a pretty heady and creative person who is most at home synthesizing meanings and creating new realities from ideas, art, music, and politics. I am slow to build intimacy and do best with relationships that are predicated on a strong friendship dynamic.

I'm looking for someone who is much more interested in prioritizing a collaborative intellectual and creative partnership than conventional marriage-family-kids. I'm interested in making stuff, separately and together. I'm more of a collectivist than an individualist and recreating the nuclear family is anathema to me, while I do love children and extended families beyond my four walls. 

Beyond this, I'm pretty open. Even if there isn't chemistry, I never consider friendship a failure, because my world is supported by a huge web of family and friends, and there's always room for more.

Please get in touch if you're interested!

Vibrant, vivacious and reflective are three words to describe me. 
Vibrant because I appreciate all the beauty in life, vivacious because I speak my mind and my native tongue is French, and reflective because I enjoy quiet times of listening to music and reading, or simply listening to the sound of silence, just being. 

I own my own business, massaging women who are pregnant, and teaching women how to massage their babies.

The woman who makes my heart skip a beat. The woman who brightens my day with a simple text, a call, her smile and laughter. The woman who is just a that a woman, and not because her age dictates it so, but a woman who knows that life is not a rigid stone but forever changing with what life throws our way. She is intelligent and caring and serious and silly. She is employed and content. She enjoys movies, and maybe has a favorite tv show and likes the outdoors. But a woman who has a life away from work and the couch and the computer. I consider myself a pretty laid back person, I try not to sweat the small stuff because in the grand scheme of things it's not worth it. I would rather spend my time letting the woman who has my heart know how I feel about her. I am not totally femme but also having some chapstick/softbutch traits if you will, and though I have mostly dated younger woman (within reason), I'm late 40s, I'm not closing myself off to any possibilities (within reason). I am pretty much open as to what I like to do for fun. If it seems like fun I will give it a go. I like to cook, watch movies, read, but most of all, I like to have good chats, even if it's about the silliest thing. I want to find someone I can be myself around and not have to change who I am as a person and I want her to be able to be exactly who she is. Isn't that what we are all looking for, someone who will love us for us? With that said, I do have preferences as I see most on here do. Mine are, she is feminine, average height, she has this aura about her that to me would make her beautiful. The arts, meditation, walks on the beach, City nights all intrigue me. Your pic gets mine.

I am looking to find someone who can love me and my daughter. 
I'm not into labels but for the sake of this ad, I'm like a combo between fem and butch?! I don't wear dresses or carry a purse, I have a shaved head, but I'm feminine all the way. 
I tend to be attracted to butch/androgyenous women but looks aren't incredibly important to me. A woman who can keep up with my wit and sarcastic humor is incredibly attractive to me! I need a good hearted woman who can make me laugh and have long conversations with. I also need someone who is not afraid to put themselves out there and take those first few steps. I spent too many years in a crappy relationship so I still find myself on the shy side sometimes. 
What I'm not interested in are men, couples or women who are ""curious"" I'm looking for that authentic woman to spend time with and hopefully something more... I hope to hear from you soon. :)

Hi,

My first time posting here. It's one of those times when you can't go to sleep and you wonder why is it that all my pretty close female friends don't live nearby or in the country? I gotta find me someone here. I'm 28, have my life together, not from the U.S., I have ambitions, goals that I'm making happen... but then there's that other side of me who wants to explore myself on a deeper level... I think I can use an attractive and confident woman to help me achieve that. You must be confident, secure, HOT, savvy, well cultured, outspoken and open minded. Open minded to explore yourself with me.. open minded to possibly travel, take risks in life, open minded to finding ways to improve each other's lives. That's when you know you found a good friend. When you add value to each other's lives. Last thing I'd like to say is, please don't be a flake, fake and personal hygiene is extremely important to me. It should be to you too. I look forward to meeting you, beautiful one! xo

Might as well state off the bat, to weed out unnecessary responses ha: I know this is a women seeking women ad, but no I don't want to be your curiosity satisfying, experimental lesbian fling.. so if that's what you want you should probably look elsewhere. Kay, great, now that's out of the way...

Hmm. never really know where to start with these.. name maybe? Yeah name is good. My name is Sarah. :P Kind of hard to summarize yourself, but I'll start with a few fun facts- I'm thoughtful, good-natured, bit of a goofball, I love conversing about pretty much anything from lighthearted to in depth so long as the dialogue flows, though awkward conversations can be fun and memorable as well. I'm a nature loving, ocean diving, animal loving flower child, and I enjoy a variety of music, so if you want a conversation starter feel free to ask about that- or be brave and tell me what you like first. :) Either way. I have a broad variety of activities I like, including but not limited to- hiking, swimming, daydreaming, reading, doodling, etcetera. I can be a pretty balanced blend of active and couch potato, which side comes out usually depends on who I'm hanging with. Anywho, I'm on here cause work is a bit of a time consumer, a big one actually, and its hard to meet up with people organically, hence giving this a go. I'd like to have someone special, or just new friends in general, to share new experiences with. Plus it'd be fantastic to meet more folks who fall under the lgbtq umbrella, though its cool to meet straight peeps as well, so long as you're engaging and all around respectful then it won't matter. I'm open to friends, a fwb's situation, or maybe a romantic partner, depending how we click. So if you feel we could potentially hit it off in any of these departments, don't be shy to message. Or, if you're naturally shy but feel a strong urge to contact me, then seize the moment bashful one! Haha. I'm pretty approachable, yunno, like I said, so long as you're respectful and all that jazz.. aka just don't be a jerk and we'll be cool. x)

When it comes to romantic/sexual interests, I'm looking for women ONLY, I can't stress that enough, but I feel like I have to press this, based on men trying to hit me up for dates and/or hookups, despite my interests being crystal clear. Guys, this is a woman seeks woman ad, c'mon now, you're barking up the wrong tree here. 

Moving on, where romantic interests are concerned, I'd like to talk to someone who is passionate about something, has some self confidence, someone who has a decent sense of humor, knows how to be respectful, is naturally an affectionate soul, and likes to go on adventures. Someone who is very comfortable with who they are. Looks wise I am not incredibly particular, I like an array of body types but mainly my attention is captivated by engaging personality and a cute face. :) I am on the thicker/curvier side so whoever is interested from a dating standpoint needs to be ok with that. 

Friends: Can be of any sex: anyone who can appreciate a sarcastic sense of humor and can give it back, in a fun and playful way, not a snide way. Someone who is supportive, real, laid back but also likes to go on adventures, as well. 

Deal breakers for me when it comes to romantic interests: Cigarette smokers, taking hard drugs, bad hygiene, lack of imagination/compassion/honesty. While we're on the topic of honesty- please be honest and communicative in regards to STD's, if we spend time and it reaches the point where intimacy seems like a likelihood between us. I'd prefer it to be a risk free experience entirely, but I understand fully that shit happens, and there's ways to play it safe under these circumstances. For the record I am clear in this area, and am willing to provide proof affirm this. 

Other deal-breakers, for FRIENDS, OR ROMANTIC INTERESTS: Having a sexist, violent, racist, or really, derogatory in any way, type of mindset. Just. Nope. Tryina steer clear of negativity here, folks! 

&,

If you are interested in seeing if a friendship or more can be sparked here, please send me a photo of you (keep it pg please,) along with the headline of ""FRIEND"" if you are interested in friendship, and ""SOMETHING MORE"" if you think we could have some chemistry, so I know you are real and I know what you are seeking. also I will be more eager to respond if you do this, cause it'll show you read my information and are actually interested in details. heads up, if you don't send me a picture i'll be less inclined to respond if we're being honest.

Additionally, please only message me if you are in or near Milpitas/San Jose or can make the trip here, ideally though I'd like to establish good connections with peeps (friends or otherwise,) that are in my area. To clarify, if you are interested in more than friendship, the age range I'm willing to date is 20-30... in some cases, 35 at the oldest. Please take that into account.

Another thing to take into account when messaging, make it a message that's worth replying to! I've had some thoughtful responses, but I've gotten my fair share of hi's and hey's, one worded responses don't do much for me. :P 

Thanks guys, let's make something happen here. :) 

Peace and well wishes. 



p.s. Dudes, if you send me a dick pic I will just laugh and proceed to delete it. Really, not trying to be harsh, but sending one to begin with is awkward especially in this context, and you would get nothing positive out of it. Again just to to reiterate, i'm open to a friendship with you if you are male however I'm only interested in dating women. 

p.s.s. I would like to disclose (since this has caused some confusion and conflict, though i don't know why) I identify as pansexual, feel free to look up the definition and ask me about it if you are confused, however if you are disrespectful about it we aren't going to get along. I am attracted to various genders and personalities, but at this point in time, i'm ONLY interested in women romantically, and I don't see that changing. Girls, if you are interested in me, great, but don't try to get me to change my orientation, or look down upon it. Guys, don't look at it as an opportunity to try to get in my pants cause it's not happening. Aaaand yeah, that long side note about covers it. Haha.

Few things im interested in: communication
Positive attitudes
Sense of humor

Few things im not interested in:
Non-communicators

There's so much that can't be listed here in a personal ad. My thoughts and interested are grand. 

My spirit has tugged me out of a unhealthy situation-without placing blame.

Im starting to feel again, to hope again, encouraged that all is not lost.

I promised myself to live in the moment, accept peace/love in my life even when it doesn't fit my usual image and more importantly trust my intuition my spirit is STRONG.

hey there, i hope this doesnt offend people. i am tall and thin. i like to crossdress. clothes from the men's section (especially pants, i have a 28 inch waist) tend to fit me awkwardly so i try to piece together my wardrobe from both male and female fashions in an attempt to feel more comfortable with myself. i don't smoke cigarettes. i love to play music and enjoy creating it.i dislike sports and mock macho masculinity. i'm not very competitive and in most cases i believe competition between individuals to be a waste of time and a worthless pursuit. i enjoy the feeling of being moved to tears by a book or a movie. i like to discuss emotions. i am more sexually attracted to an emotional connection than a girl's physical attributes. though i do tend to prefer a more tomboyish girl as it does tend to offset me. the more masculine qualities a female has the better. maybe if i havent scared you away and you think you might be interested, write me a note and your picture will get my picture

I am an attractive, educated, gainfully employed femme looking for a partner in crime. We may end up just as friends, but I'd really love to meet someone who could be so much more.

Me: fit, active, sassy, optimistic, kind, lover of laughter, adventure, books, watching the sun rise with a mug of tea in hand, the ocean and Europe, specifically Italy. I love to cook, hike, catch live music, a movie and enjoy long cuddle sessions. I'm extremely sexual, but not promiscuous. 

You: femme, fit, intelligent, active, sincere, but wickedly funny, gainfully employed and kind. You possess a positive energy and outlook. I don't care about your skin color. Ideally you're 28-45, single, and live either in SF or the East Bay. 

Interested? I'd love to hear from you. :)

Hi,

I am a 32 year old African American woman. I do not use a label to identify myself, but I have been known to be called both femme and stud, given the situation and the clothes on myself. I love live music, spokeword poetry, Ethiopian food, trying new things, holding hands, walks on the beach or another large body of water, smirking, charasmatic people, sarcastic and sex inuendos, painting, bicycling, and the idea of making love to your mind. 

Sidebar:
I have a few tats and a few piercings.
I'm a Techie.
Surfing and skydiving are on the good bucket list.

I would lIke to meet woman of any nationality, who are strong, confident, successful, and easy going. Bright, artistic, intelligent infectious personalities tend to rule me, but no manipulation or petty games...sorry. 
I'm too damn grown for that!

If this is you...let's be light...converse then meet.

Peace

*Dee

Hi,
I'm nikole I'm 22yrz old, born lezbian. Libra I love smoking pot and livin life to the fullest. I'm the kinda person who won't say no to a dare. All around I'm a good person,i love to have fun and party. imy goal is to make everyone laugh. Life is too short to be missing out on all the fun. i can be shy but once you get to know me im funny and outgoing. My Absolute favorite things to do envolve being outdoors like camping, swimnin, hiking, 4 wheeling, i love nature and am a firm believer that you should take time to stop and smell the roses

Ive been hurt by almost everyone ive daited and recently just got out of a relationship. However I do not believe everyone is the same and refuse treat others as if responsible for experiences of the past. 
If you want to be ny girl you gotta be honest, faithfull, passionant and open minded. Love is somthing that should be cherished.

My kinda girl would be sweet, funnn and caring But must know how to communicate and COMMIT. Must love to cuddle and kiss a lot, like to hold hands ,spontaneously makeout and know how to please. I'm a very sexual person and I believe sex is important in a but not everthing in a relationship so I'm gonna be up front and honest. I am a freak who loves the touch of a dominate but passionate woman. Trying new things is fun Yes I'm kinky, I'm into roleplay an biting n spanking. Can you handle? I know how to treat a girl right, get to know me :)

I'm a little shy when it comes to this whole dating thing, don't count on me to make the first move...

Happily partnered polyamorous pansexal woman seeking a like minded fwb.

I am attracted to all sorts of folks, but if you live on the fringes that is probably the best fit. I am quirky and honest. I am experienced with all types of kink, but not necessarily looking for that. If we really hit it off, I am open to your kinks no matter how taboo. Happy to let you know my hard limits if we get to that point.

Yes, this is a real ad. I am just looking for one randy human who would like an easygoing friendship & sexual relationship with a rad chick. Currently have a male partner so I am not looking for a single male. A couple might be OK but it would depend upon the couple. 

So I know you read my ad, please change the subject to ""coconut oil"". Any replies without that will just go in the trash. Please send a thoughtful reply if you would like a response and a photo.

me:
mixed woman of color
Chubby feminine body
large chest
long dreadlocks
au naturel
tall
hot bush
lots of tattoos
love kissing, 69
artys leftist alternative
very private
drug, disease, drama free

you:
oral
no tobacco smokers, no vaping, 
female identified of any age, shape as long as you are legal, young at heart & dtf.

looking for ongoing fwb (no cheaters, poly welcome)

I am mobile and for the right situation location doesn't matter.

strong preference for pacific islander, black, asian, middle eastern, indigenous or latina.

stuff I like: metal, punk, hardcore, doom, drone, noise, goth, drums, guitar, vinyl records, rock collecting, antiquing, thrift stores, indigenous rights, queer rights, poc rights, smashing the state, animal liberation, pet rats, Spanish, herbs, oils, natural health, cooking, gardening, tinkering, art, crafts, hiking, beaches, nature, vegan, raw food

Hello out there wherever you are Alice is looking through the looking glass
seeing if you are anywhere to be found? 
Here is my wish list.......Seeking a very kind person that now has some time 
to spend doing movies, walks, weekend rides to a little hole in the wall to have
lunch things of this nature or simply watching a DVD together.. are people doing 
that anymore? Everything or somethings are a lot more fun when shared. I am 
not seeking immense stimulation as in cliff diving and extreme sports I think I 
will protect what's left of the body. 
Now here is the really important details I am not looking for someone that lives 
far away nor someone under the age of 57...........but certainly would like meeting 
someone up to 10 years older than that. 
I did this posting to see if you are out there. I am average/cute kind funny sometimes 
serious woman petite in size and fit. I love long walks the prettier the better in 
choosing where to walk you game? I like many things too many to list. I am also not
asking for anyone's hand in marriage so no problem there. I am not bisexual. Lesbian
forever and not a new kid on the block. Now here is really the very important part
I am neither fem nor butch but a mix of it all. I don't look androgynous as well. I look
like me..................my tastes vary and like many different styles and people. If you have
a certain expectation of what you are looking for you may not find me appealing again 
I am not one of the people that you look at out there and say ""OH she is a lesbian""
I am hard to read.. I say keep them guessing. I am a mystery to even me. I like just being

You could join me one day (the captain is also a gay woman so she doesn't mind) or we could have some after hours fun on deck or in the engine room! I live in Bernal Heights but the boat is in Oakland. I'm pretty in the center between stud and fem, and I'm a white mix. Let me know what's up and I'll send you a pic.

Hey girls! Just looking for one person to hang out and chat with. I am attracted to girls but since I've only been to the States for a year and a half, I don't have many female friends, which I realize guys can't substitute. So I thought I'd give CL a try. 

I'd like to get to know someone who's drug-free, easy-going, friendly, open-minded and active. Because I myself am. And whom I could call out on a dance party or a dinner time cooking at my/your place, who I could visit frequently and talk about random stuff and about life and family. I am very open-minded and stable, I love new experiences and learning new things. Although I am not particularly looking for sexual experience, I'd like to keep that open if there's real chemistry. I prefer you're around my age, active, in shape. Most importantly, someone who enjoys life and lots of positive energy. 

I like being in nature, hiking, excercising and just being active in general, I'm a competitive swimmer and I like doing lots of arts and music and a variety of other stuff. My strength is that I never get depressed over long period of time, I always seem to manage to make myself happy. I love singing, dancing, writing (songs), playing the guitar/piano/drum. I'm talented at doing most things but haven't seem to find something I'm truly passionate about that make me want to stick with. I'm a very positive person.

Anyway, I'd love to hearing back from you gals! Get back to me with a picture of your pretty self and a brief introduction to your self, including what do you love to do on weekends. AND... your favorite country to visit and why. Please be willing to meet in person, as I'm not into cyber friends. *without info above will be ignored. one-liners, men, perverts don't waste time replying

And yep that's me in the picture. I'm from China, speak Mandarin, English fluently, learning Spanish, French. Plus if you speak another language.

Been out of the dating scene for some time now. Wanting to get back into life and go do something this weekend. I have had little to no social life giving myself space.

I'm mobile so I can travel.
I'm 34, very athletic, like to consider myself attractive inside and out. Everyone has a type they have chemistry with and there are some people that just don't. Please be fit, healthy and attractive inside and out. I'm 420 friendly and super laid back. If you are interested in hanging out message me a picture and some info so I know you are real and a female...dudes are scandalous! Looking forward to meeting someone chill.

So, this may sound pretty weird but I am so tired of dating and meeting people who 1) have some sort of catch (they're married, not over their ex, or are pregnant..I know I have bad luck with women apparently) 

I'm REALLY looking for someone to settle down with. I am 23 but have an old soul, I know what I want and who I am, I've done all my partying in my teen years (quite a lot, over it). The problem is I keep meeting people who aren't ready to settle down, or don't have the ultimate goal of getting married. I don't mean to sound unattractive by complaining, I just want to make the point that I am seeking a woman who is willing to pursue me in the hopes of settling down with me (WITHOUT crazy baggage). 
I'm going to be up front, if I like you I'm not very good at taking things slow. I like affection, I like reminding my girl how amazing she is all the time and apparently that is too much for some people to handle. I fall hard, which I recognize is a flaw but am seeking someone who is equally excited about me as I am them. Someone passionate, a hopeless romantic like myself. 

Now that we have that out of the way..

About me: 
23 
Full time employed by a MAJOR social networking site (not going to post which one, but feel free to ask) 
Introverted, I prefer snuggling up and watching a movie to clubbing any day. 
Enjoys being called daddy in bed (Just to get that out of the way haha) 
REALLY into physics, philosophy, psychology and deep conversations 
Working on getting sleeve tattoos, I have some big ones on my arms already.
5''6 
I do volunteer work, I love to help others!
Really (and obviously) sick of the dating scene. I am sure I will get some smart ass emails, but whatever. 
I love to write and read! #Nerd power
I play guitar, used to be in a punk band. 
Suuuuper romantic. 


If you're looking for someone who doesn't play games and is ready for something real and long term (and you think we'd be a good match) email me with a photo and some information about yourself. Let's go on a date! 

I'm really into androgynous women, so points if you fit that!

Hi! I'm not sure if cl is the place to find someone, but you never know what the internets will bring, so maybe it might be you! I am tall, brown hair and eyes, good looking butch woman. Looking for someone more on the femme side of things and smart. I like binge watching netflix and going out to the movies. Riding bikes and dining out. Love anything outdoors--camping or hiking. And indoors I like playing video games and other ""sports"". I am a really good kisser. It takes me a while to open up to someone, but once I do, I am incredibly loyal and love to spoil my girlfriends. I have a job working with kids and am in my late (ok, real late :) thirties. Tell me about yourself and let's see if we click! Have a great day!

I believe if you have an appreciation for music and you live long enough that your life will develop a soundtrack. . . 2013 gave me life's ultimate blow and separation : 
Not a day goes by, That I don't think of you,
I'm always asking why this crazy world had to lose, Such a ray of light we never knew,
Gone too soon, (Gone Too Soon -- Michael Jackson)

2014 gave me : I'm glad this week is over, I need to get away,
Go home and throw my clothes on, Come get you right away!
Can't wait to see you looking lovely, I hope you're thinking of me,
Cause all I want is time with you And don't need nothing more!

So in love with you,
So in love with you, (So In Love With You -- Jill Scott w/Anthony Hamilton) . . .only to have it turn into I was living the dream believing things that just ain't true. Oh I can't believe I ever believed in you
You had me chasing fool's gold
I was chasing fool's gold
I was chasing fool's gold. . ..(Fool's Gold -- Jill Scott)

So today. . . I sit here with myself waiting to live this song out : Pieces of me were scattered . . ...Blowing in the cold
In different directions...hmm
Truth, truth, truth be told
Oh, then I looked into your eyes
Everything felt like it could be alright

You went and put me back together
Back together again

Keeping it real, I've run a few ads and I've the thing that I've discovered is that the ads with song lyrics have opened the door to conversation with a few very lovely ladies (some more than once. . ..which lets me know there are women seeking to find something tangible). The conversations were light and breezy because of the song. . .no love connection yet, but I remain undaunted, I just haven't selected a song from my mental jukebox that touches that special someone's soul. Until that happens I'll write, post and wait patiently for her to feel the font and dance through my mind.

I possess qualities that make for a relatively decent long term relationship. I'm chivalrous, communicative, and honest, I look for the positive, I'm loyal. I'm an incurable romantic that is constantly looking for ways to enhance the romance. I believe in the ""just because"" acts that mean a lot. I'm a totally capable and confident woman. Me, soft butch, average height, average physique, soft spoken, pretty laid back and chill for the most part; let me add to the fine print -- I can be a handful but I can't do and don't like a lot of arguing and drama. I'm college educated. I appreciate good book, movies, theater, music (the arts in general.) I'm looking for someone who can be content with a night of Netflix as well as a night on the town..

I'm looking for something real, not a hook up or some (body) thing to do until something better comes along (been on the receiving end of that BS and it's not cool at all) 
About you, FEM, WOMAN OF COLOR, 35-50 years old; a grown a** woman who can say what she feels without drama, name calling and friends as a peanut gallery. I'm attracted to women who appreciate the butch/fem dynamic. I'm also attracted to women who are classy, intelligent, well read and well spoken, kind, spiritual, polite, and patient.

Please no men, couples, bi or BBW . Please be d/d free, no 420, no smoking. . ...

Updated...if you have never had a relationship with another woman please don't reply. 

If you aren't serious about developing a relationship than please don't respond. 

I don't judge others so if you are shallow or superficial you won't be interested in me.

I am a woman looking for a woman. I have a husband and don't need or want another man...ever. 

I'm married and I have a family BUT I'm available for dates on weekend or week nights. I'm not looking to blend you with my family. This relationship is between you and I. If you have a husband or a wife that's great but please don't ask me to meet them or double date. 

I enjoy intelligent conversations. Good food and good wine . I am a social drinker and I don't smoke. 

Looking for a woman to date and potentially have a sexual relationship with. I said date, not hook up and never ever hear from you again. I am not looking for a hook up or a booty call. If you want to sleep with me than we need to know more about each other than a few texts. 

You, have to have your own money. I'm not a sugar mama. I can't and won't take care of you. You need to be local - South Bay only. I have a lot of time during the day to meet up. 

Height, weight and ethnicity is not important but I prefer women of color. I am a African American woman and I'm height and weight proportionate. 

Discretion is important to me. If you want to go out in public as a couple that's fine but I'm not into PDA'S at all. I'm very private about my relationships. I will not ever want to share you with my husband or my friends. This relationship is just for you and I. I will not introduce you to my family...ever. 

Looking for someone who is close to 50 or older. No flakes. No drama or unrealistic expectations please. Please don't start a email conversation and then flake out. I am easy on the eyes and I look far younger than my age. I love to talk and get to know people. Friendships are always welcome. Everything doesn't have to be about a sexual relationship. Real women only...others need not respond. I detest flakey people. If we don't click that's fine but don't judge a book by its cover...read a few pages.

It's one thing to want something casual, to think one night stands are all you need. It's another thing to know you want a profound bond, to find someone that you just get and who gets you. That's what I want. I want a love like you read in a storybook, perfectly imperfect and made for each other. 

Pleased to meet you. A little more about me, I'm twenty four pretty nice looking I suppose, though i don't base much on that. Curvy and thick in stature, half Japanese half white. I'm a comic book nerd, and supernatural fanatic. I write and read, crochet and paint. I'll try anything once. 

I'm an animal lover and you should be too.. bonus points if you have tattoos and piercings and/or are nerdy.

I love a woman who can communicate and is honest. I do not smoke or do drugs. I am a social drinker. 

Romantically, I prefer Black women but I open to other ethnicities to build solid, healthy friendships. 

Potential lovers please be 5'4 or taller, small bbw or average size (no one larger than size 18). I like all women but for those that do labels/role playing.....If you are a ultra girlie girl like me please be neat. If you are a stud/butch and you wear men's clothes be neat, no thug appearance. I love professional women.

No pictures are needed because if you aren't willing to meet in a public setting the way you look is irrelevant.

I've never had a committed relationship with a woman. Threesomes and hook ups, yes. Flirtations, surely. But the notion of actually falling in love has been on my mind for months, and I can't stop thinking about the possibilities. Recent conversations and viewings of ""Carol"" have confirmed this void in my life.

I'm a young, active, ultra femme, full-time pre-law student living alone in my own place in the Inner Sunset. I work for a top cosmetic company as a special f/x makeup artist. I'm a bookish intellectual, cat mom, plus-size model, and close friend to many queer folks of all backgrounds. I don't drink or smoke, but I enjoy drugs occasionally (for the sake of full transparency).

I've been attracted to different types, though I imagine you quite clearly: older, very smart, protective, dominant, around my height or taller, short or buzzed dark hair, tattoos, retro vintage style, butch/androgynous, rough around the edges. The ying to my yang.

I've typically seduced and topped women in the past, but they've never fit that description. If you do, I'll probably be so captivated and shy, I would submit to you. I may still get aggressive from time to time, especially if you provoke or deeply move me.

Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I am looking for a short term arrangement, open to long term. I nursed my children for about 8 years and I really miss lactating. I would like to induce lactation once again, but I need some help. I am looking for a woman who likes nursing and would be comfortable in helping me establish a good milk supply and maybe a relationship will develop. I am DD free, HWP and a working professional. 

Regards,

D

Hi there,

I've been very attracted to girls/women lately. I would like to meet someone who is in the same state, or bisexual/lesbian. We could meet, get to know each other and see how things go. We could end up just as friends, or we might both find something more. 

Me: fit, intelligent, kind, enjoys the simple pleasures in life. 
You: fit, intelligent, kind, and positive. 

Please respond only if you are genuinely interested, thank you.

No men, no couples, single women ONLY respond.

Hello ladies, 
I'm a bit spontaneous hence my post. I would love to meet for drinks tonight, yes sunday, dance, play some pool or shoot darts at a local ba. I'm not interested in one night stands , so I'm not posting this in hopes to get laid but hopefully meet a cool friend better yet someone I can vibe with, flirt with,,? Steal a kiss someone I like and want to see again :) 
All ages shapes and sizes welcome obviously you must be 21 and pls have a sense of maturity if u are that young. Older women pls be unattached without emotional strain but a open heart. 

Be financially secure. Have a good sense of humor because I'm full of laughter and witty responses. 
Anyhow I look forward to seeing you tonight for a drink.
I'm more attracted to someone's vibe than their face but since we are online u must send me a face pic for the fact I need to know who to look for when meeting.. I hate to say.. no pic no reply. Send a number so we can call/text each other prior to meeting :)

Wanting to relocate (haight ashbury)
Hi there. I'm a 63 yr old GWF, looking for another woman, for companionship, and partnership. Right now, I live in PA, but wanting to recolate. Wanting someone to share my life with. I am not seeking a sexual relationship, at this time. But I do like affection, and romance. I'm young at heart, looks, and lifestyle. It seems i am older then most on here, so i'm not sure about this way of trying to find someone, but since i live in a small town, and don't like bars, i don't really have many ways to connect with other woman. Maybe i'll find someone in a similar situation. I want someone available to put time and energy into a new person. NOT looking for someone far away, or who's real busy, or tied up with work, or friends, and family. Wanting to meet someone who is on their own, with free time, and places our time first. I like to hang out, and get cozy at home. At home we can dance, watch good movies, make healthy meals, read metaphysical books, listen to meditation tapes, and grow together through these teachings. I'm looking for someone between 45 & 68. I'm not a city person. I like the country and nature. I love long heart to heart talks, in person, or on the phone. I like to take walks. I'm a free thinker. I am also very much a homebody, but also enjoy the malls, department stores, supermarkets, book stores, library, park and beach. I'm health conscious, and looking for someone who is also. I am interested in Metaphysics, and Christanity, without the Dogma, and looking for someone to share that with. Eating healthy, and exercising. I'm down to earth, kind and loving, and very supportive. I am looking to find someone , who is non judgemental, and understanding, open minded, and not the jealous type. Relationships, should add to your life, not take away from it. Also, needing someone, that if an issue comes up, we can work through it together, instead of running away, and giving up, at the first sign of trouble. No security, with this kind of person. Need someone who is available to spend alot of time together. So lets talk on the phone first, exchange pictures, and seeing if we have enough in common, and make a connection. From there, we can meet eventually in person, but for now, on Skype, and see how we feel then. If we connect, see if we get along, and are compatable, and if there is a chemestry between us. I always look at the heart of a person (the good qualities). Also a good sense of humor is important. But a good heart is even better, and I do not judge by looks. I myself, have alot of love to give. I like someone who is laid back, and feminine, in a down to earth way, and medium built. Not wanting someone, too thin, or to stocky. No butches, please, or femmes, with butch sides to their character. I am fem-not butch. I'm real, natural, and honest, and looking for the same. I am spiritual, into metaphysics, and I'm a Jew for Jesus. Thanks for reading. I am clean and sober hippy type. BE CLEAN, SOBER, & A NON SMOKER! I am also seeking more close friends. I have alot of phone friends, but only one close person, that I see, and not very often.

Hey there 

Yes I'm resorting to Craigslist for a dating ad. I dont know many people as I am usually working and not into the party scene so it's hard to meet people. 


About me: 
23 

Financially independent 

I have arm tattoos, looking to get sleeves. 

Enjoys anything intellectual (physics, philosophy, political discussions, psychology) 

Id rather go to a book store or museum as opposed to a bar. 

Affectionate. I love hand holding and whatnot. 

5""6 and ""a little extra"" but handsome :)

Ps4 and comic book fanatic. 

There is obviously a lot more to a person than one can say in an online post, but there is a general description of me haha. 

Dominant in bed (but enjoy being dominated as well so have at it). Obviously I'm not looking for a hookup but figured I'd throw that in there. 

My ideal match: 

Within a decent age range. 

Employed, I need someone who is also doing something with their life. I haven't lived with my parents since I was a teenager. I like a woman that is striving for success. I'm sapiosexual so intellect and drive are huge turn ons for me. 

Please, please please be monogamous. When I'm talking to someone or dating them it's just them. I dont want to waste my time with someone who isn't ready to committ. 

If you are not over your ex or are currently into someone then I'm not the person for you. Again, I dont want to waste any more time or be a distraction for someone. 

Please have a good sense of humor. I love to laugh! 

420 friendly. It's cool if you dont partake in cannabis, but please respect that I do as it calms my anxiety. 

Please be affectionate too! 

I hope I find my person :) 

PLEASE READ IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS I WILL NOT RESPOND: 

Send a photo with your response. No picture no reply.

Here it is.......I'm not bisexual and for those who are that's great but I'm

not and wish to meet a LESBIAN. If you are looking for a label Butch/Fem

I am just somewhere centered in the middle and hard to read if that is not your

thing don't bother. I am fit and on the smaller side of the spectrum. I'm not prone 

to dating really tall women....I wear jeans mostly but dress up nicely no dresses.....

not my thing. I'm seeking a nice person that would like to do the simplistic things 

in life not extreme sports! If you want a woman friend as a loving comfort zone 

a special someone to talk with that will listen and I will hope for the same including a 

companion in a romantic sense do reply. I think I will skip the picture ""NO!"" I won't

nor judge a book by it's cover but will want to read the contents of the story within

then I will discover the true beauty ............I know this online dating is a bit uncertain 

but I assure you I am pretty much an everyday person and have not escaped from any 

asylum.... Ha! Your picture will get mine I don't want us to waste our time eye appeal is

a necessity.....correct but not always. There is always something beautiful about a person

if we just take a few moments to look and listen. OH and by the way I like many doing many

things especially long walks at beautiful places. I walk fast so catch me if you can!

Our ages range from 23 to 48 and race and body type are also varied.

The most important qualities are that you be very nice, drama free, and sexually adventuresome. This kind of thing isn't for everyone, but for some of us, its wonderful.

In addition to the aforementioned professional profile, I enjoy things Japanese. I may be jaded, and biased, but I simply hold all things Japanese slightly superior: food, clothing, sensibilities, art, etc. Feel free to prove me otherwise. I'd love to explore other cultures, other sub-cultures and more.

Or are you more like Neo discovering the Matrix? I'm not looking for someone to be perfect but for someone with a commitment to creating long term health to a ripe old active and fun age.

Please tell me that you gave up mind altering substances a long time ago or your mind has become mush. Sorry. I am looking for someone fully present with a clear mind. Centered, whole and mentally healthy. I am all of that and more.
Pot or a glass of wine once in a while is fine but ''medical marijuana'' has become an excuse for addiction for far too many.

I am interested in meeting new friends in the area. I don't get out much and thought maybe CL could be an alternative to the clubs. I am an educator with a feverish love for music and great food. I have a special place in my heart for hip hop and soul because I grew up on the stuff. Meeting a woman goal oriented, driven, intelligent, kind, loving, humorous and comfortable in her skin sounds about right. There is something utterly attractive about intelligence. I'm a Family First type....my family... are the pillars in my life. My weekends are generally sketched out with hiking, biking or walking on the beach. I also have many date nights with self and Netflix :-). Sundays are for Church....and no you don't have to be a church goer for us to be friends. 

I'm laid back but active. AA 5'9 athletic, humorous and kind. I'm working on my sarcasm. ...at a point in my life where I'm noticing that it can be mean and annoying. Race doesn't matter to me... a good heart matters though. Put ""Good Heart"" on the subject line if you are interested in chatting

Hey girls! Just looking for one person to hang out and chat with. I am attracted to girls but since I've only been to the States for a year and a half, I don't have many female friends, which I realize guys can't substitute. So I thought I'd give CL a try. 

I'd like to get to know someone who's drug-free, easy-going, friendly, open-minded and active. Because I myself am. And whom I could call out on a dance party or a dinner time cooking at my/your place, who I could visit frequently and talk about random stuff and about life and family. I am very open-minded and stable, I love new experiences and learning new things. Although I am not particularly looking for sexual experience, I'd like to keep that open if there's real chemistry. I prefer you're around my age, active, in shape. Most importantly, someone who enjoys life and lots of positive energy. 

I like being in nature, hiking, excercising and just being active in general, I'm a competitive swimmer and I like doing lots of arts and music and a variety of other stuff. My strength is that I never get depressed over long period of time, I always seem to manage to make myself happy. I love singing, dancing, writing (songs), playing the guitar/piano/drum. I'm talented at doing most things but haven't seem to find something I'm truly passionate about that make me want to stick with. I'm a very positive person.

Anyway, I'd love to hearing back from you gals! Get back to me with a picture of your pretty self and a brief introduction to your self, including what do you love to do on weekends. AND... your favorite country to visit and why. Please be willing to meet in person, as I'm not into cyber friends. *without info above will be ignored. one-liners, men, perverts don't waste time replying

And yep that's me in the picture. I'm from China, speak Mandarin, English fluently, learning Spanish, French. Big plus if you speak another language and might be willing to teach me.

I guess this is where I tell you about myself and do my best to try and stand out from the rest of the people on here, right? Lol

I should start out by pointing out that I've never posted on here but my best friend keeps insisting that I ""put myself out there"". So here's my attempt, fellow Craigslisters. 

I'm 22, Mexican American/Italian. White, green eyes, blonde hair, chubby fella with an awkward stance. 
Did that paint a picture in your head about me already? Good. Let's proceed. 

I'd say I'm more ""dudeish"" I know there's right terms for these things. But I'm fairly new to this all so feel free to educate me on the correct terminology over coffee sometime? :p

But okay, I guess I can be girly sometimes. Rarely though. I'm more of a band tee/button up and skinny jeans sort of girl. 

Did I lose you already? I hope not, bear with me 'cause my thoughts are scattered all over the place and I suck at writing ""about me's"". 

At the moment, I currently have my own place, a car, going to school, employed, and I would say I have my shit together. 
I just lack that intimacy and that special someone by my side. 

I've never actually been with a girl. I've never even kissed a girl. Or well, that's a lie, I kissed one when I was in 6th grade and that's when I knew girls were for me. Lol

I'm a fairly reserved person, closed off and I keep my walls up. I'm not trying to throw myself a pity party here but I've been hurt a good amount of times and it's just closed me off to the ideas of relationships, ya know? But I feel like I'm ready. I feel like I'm open to meeting someone special that I can share my time with. I feel like that's one of the most valuable things you could give someone. 
You're never gonna get that back, so, spend it with the right person. 

I wouldn't say I'm an introvert because I do love to socialize but only with certain people. I'm a small group sort of girl. I'm into going to book stores, getting coffee, going to shows like punk shows, rock shows, indie shows. Road trips. Hiking. 
I have a pit bull whom I'd say is my son haha. I adore that dog to no end. I'm definitely an animal lover. Did you know cows love to be cuddled? I was watching this dude cuddle cows on tumblr today and it was really cute. 
Cuddle a cow with me so I know it's real. Lol jk. 

I have an awkward sense of humor, I apologize too much, and I'm really affectionate but you won't really see any of these things till I let my walls down with you. 

Before you hit me up, I need you to firmly grasp the fact that no, I'm not looking for a fuck buddy, no, I'm not looking to go to a club with you or go get drunk. I'm not looking for the love of my life on here or my soul mate, and if that were to happen that would be amazing but I don't want to be your project or your band aid. I'm not trying to fix you or add more weight onto my shoulders. 

If you message me, message me with good intentions, cause I'm tired, man. 
I won't lie to you, I have a heart of gold and I'm well aware of that. I'm just a stubbornass kid with good intentions. 

I've seen women on here post their zodiac sign so I'll tell ya right now, I'm a libra. 
Be my libroooo? Librahhh?
Not funny? Ok lol. 

Again, scattered thoughts. Bear with me. 

I'm an avid record collector. I'm really proud of my records. I go to shows a lot so a lot of them are signed and chances are that if I like you, I'll ask you to come cuddle and lay in bed with me so I can play my records to you. Haha

Uhm, hmm. When it comes to my preference of women, I'm not picky tbh. I'm attracted to intelligence and strong women. I'm attracted to open minded women with similar interests. Someone who would be down to try new food even though it scares them. Someone who would be down to go hiking on a Sunday morning and stay in and watch scary movies on a Friday night or go to a book store in San Francisco and try a new coffee shop. 

I won't lie, I'm a coffee enthusiast and a hobby of mine is checking out new coffee shops. I recently took this on in January and I've been to hella cool spots. 

I sound like a hipster. 😂

Hmm. More scattered thoughts. I am 420 friendly. I love to ride bikes. Wine is cool sometimes. Rarely though. 

I'm that kid who still laughs at the joke minutes after it's been said. I'm really clumsy. I strongly believe that it takes nothing whatsoever to be kind to one another. We all have shit going on, ya know? We're all fighting our own battles so be kind. 
I used to play the trumpet in a ska band. I can also play the violin. I've always wanted to learn to play the drums. I can't read music for shit, I learned on my own by watching others play. 
I'm really bad at directions and chances are I'll get lost with you at one point in our adventures lol. I speak 3 languages fluently. Spanish. Italian. And English obviously. I'm really awkward, please understand that, not too awkward to the point where it stands out but if you've ever wanted to meet Michael Cera, I'll come ridiculously close. I have a few tattoos. Charles Bukowski is my favorite writer. Making puns is a hobby. 


Hmm,. What else.. I dunno. I feel like I've already bored most of ya, so, if any of you feel like hitting me up, feel free to do so. It wouldn't hurt to meet someone new. Friends are cool. 

And no, dudes, I don't wanna see your chode. 

Kik me?

Before you read any further, I won't respond if you don't include a picture and am not interested in men or couples looking for a third. I'm too used to wading through responses from men, or couples, and I need to know that you are a real woman. 

I'm 27, blonde, thin, on the femme end of things and looking for a woman to please. Nothing turns me on more that making a woman come; I love pillow princesses and my tastes generally lean towards femme gals, but I am an equal opportunity lover of women and their pleasure, so don't be afraid to respond if you don't necessarily think of yourself as femme. I'm open to meeting someone who is just starting to get their feet wet with women, or is in a relationship with a man but craves a woman's touch, but would prefer serious replies only. 

At the moment I am not looking for a relationship, but would be open to one developing in the future, just a fun time with wonderful woman who will enjoy being pampered sexually. 

Please reply with a recent picture and put the title of the last book you read in the subject line of your reply, so I know you're not a robot. 

I look forward to hearing from you soon!

I'm looking for a womyn, who enjoys caring for her partner. 
She is a lesbian (and it's been more than a minute), who loves womyn and has been looking for the womyn she will share her life with... She eats food and has a curvy body....she likes to have her hair played with (she finds it very calming)....she is so excited to share her day. 

She enjoys travel, experiencing new things, domestic puttering, loves to cook and is 100% loyal to her other half. She puts a lot into her relationship and it shows. She is a kind, nurturing womyn who loves getting dolled up (she knows this is going to make her partner...very happy). She likes to look her best for her other half. She also loves playing in the bedroom. She is not timid, but she definitely enjoys supporting her partner.

She appreciates all that is shared with her, and values the time and attention she receives. 
NO drugs, NO smoking, light drinking is fine.

Me: I am 45y, Educated professional, nice looking womyn of color, full-figured, lesbian, Top, well dressed, well read, lover of womyn with dark hair and curves....open to all nationalities....but only nurturing personalities.

Do you believe in happy endings? At 59 I know that not all stories end happily, but I still believe that I can have it all. Now I just need to find the companion. I am looking for someone who can start out as a friend with the possibility that there will be the right magic to spark a romance.
I am looking for someone who loves to laugh, believes in honesty and has a slightly eccentric streak. I love all types of movies, most types of music, NetFlix dramas, Dancing with the Stars, mystery and historical novels. I like walking and bicycling, coffee at sunrise and talking late into the evening.
If you are smart and funny, love to laugh, and capable of listening with an open heart; if you are curious and creative, eager to learn something new every day; if you are comfortable sitting quietly at home in the evening; if you like to roam a museum and ride a bike and cheer at a baseball game and cry at the movies, then maybe you are the woman of my dreams.
If you still believe in magic, please respond with a little bit about yourself.

I'm ready to put myself out there and find that special woman. That woman that reminds me what it is like to have butterflies in my stomach and that anxious excitement again. 
About me.... I'm a small, Caucasian women, brunette with blue eyes, tattooed and I'm a mom. I have a young daughter who is my world. 
I am looking to find someone who can love me and my daughter. 
I'm not into labels but for the sake of this ad, I'm like a combo between fem and butch?! I don't wear dresses or carry a purse, I have a shaved head, but I'm feminine all the way. 
I an attracted to butch/androgyenous women but looks aren't incredibly important to me. A woman who can keep up with my wit and sarcastic humor is incredibly attractive to me! I need a good hearted woman who can make me laugh and have long conversations with. I also need someone who is not afraid to put themselves out there and take those first few steps. I spent too many years in a crappy relationship so I still find myself on the shy side sometimes. 
What I'm not interested in are men, couples or women who are ""curious"" I'm looking for that authentic woman to spend time with and hopefully something more... I hope to hear from you soon. :)

Hello,

I've noticed most my friends live outside the city. I am trying to find a new group of friends who live in the city. I am femme and very outgoing. I enjoy meeting new people.
I'd like to find a friend to connect with and get to know. I enjoy many things and always up for new adventures. I also love to go out dancing every now and then.

I haven't done this in a long time, so I thought I'd give it a shot..


Are you Asian?
Do you like women?
Are you into Latinas?
Are you smart and well aware of your surroundings?
Do you like girls who are a bit of both, butch and fem?Do you like to have deep talks about life, conspiracies, politics, etc?

If you said yes to all of these or most of these, you're in the right place :)

I think Asian women are beautiful. I've also encountered mixed girls who are Latina and Asian.
Honestly, it's such a beautiful mix!! Especially those that speak Spanish. 
*Bonus points*

I'd like to see if I can make a connection with you. If you are the kind of person that thinks outside the box, cares about doing something for humanity, is self-less or whatever the case, this is huge. It's rare to find someone who has those qualities nowadays.


A little about me:

I'm lesbian (hoping you are too) Latina, in my mid twenties and in college, almost done with my B.A.
Love the outdoors and trying new things. I'm a very positive person, and I always strive for the best. 
I'd give more info but I'd rather share that over some coffee or if you're a night owl, over some drinks?
I'm shooting for a platonic friendship first but let's see how this all plays out, and if we connect, then great :) 

So if this all applies to you send me a message with the title of your favorite hobby. ""I love to cook, play tennis, etc""

PS: No dudes, threesomes, bicurious, married, or women with kids. Also, please be serious about this. If you aren't down to meet up then don't reply.

Leap...I'll Catch You

There's nothing more attractive than a woman who is willing to do something different, something unfamiliar, something out of the ordinary...

I don't mean something that would dishonor her values or ethics. 

I'm referring to an action that leaps into love's grasp with a reckless abandon of all else...

A woman who...
-Laughs at herself 
-Sees patterns as messages 
-Forgives the past
-Listens for transformation 
-Dances in the mirror 
-Offers reciprocal kindness 
-Doesn't have to be right 
-Loves is her purpose 

Listen..if you're deep, been looking for a woman who is also deep beyond measure...

Vibrant, vivacious and reflective are three words to describe me. 
Vibrant because I appreciate all the beauty in life, vivacious because I speak my mind and my native tongue is French, and reflective because I enjoy quiet times of listening to music and reading, or simply listening to the sound of silence, just being. 

I own my own business, massaging women who are pregnant, and teaching women how to massage their babies.

I'm a single, over 35, natural/make-up free (unless it's a special occasion) femme-tomboy seeking both a new place to call home, literally & figuratively. I'm looking to rent a room from another sane, sober beautiful woman. I do have a cat, so please like or love cats yourself. If you have a dog, I'm good with that so long as your dog is cat-friendly.

I'm educated, cultured, enjoy both the outdoors & vegging in front of the tv. I'm tidy, responsible, respectful, caring & affectionate and you are too. I don't smoke, drink or do any drugs (incl. coffee) and neither do you.

You're feminine, slender, fit or have curves & have a healthy lifestyle. You're between the age of 34-46. And yeah, I like a pretty face with warm eyes & smile. I have the same to offer ;)

If we find each other, we're going to start off slow by first getting to know each other as new housemates. Then, we'll see how we are as friends. If we're still attracted to each other, then we can take it to the next level. I'm looking to build & share a life & home with the right person.

If you don't match the romantic part but have a room to rent, please contact me anyway. A new friend is also welcome :)

And please, Single WOMEN only. Thank you :)

Hello! I am 30, lesbian, femme with a tomboy side. I am very sweet, romantic, and fun. I am a dental assistant and I have an online store where I design and sell products. For fun I love doing kickboxing, mma and going to amusement parks, movies, beach. Staying home, relaxing is also good too. 

I am looking for a sweet and honest girl that is caring, has a wonderful personality, faithful, smart. I want a girl that will text me anytime of the day just to show that she cares and to spend time with each other. I am looking for a girl that is not afraid to communicate especially if something is wrong. I am a hopeless romantic and I would like my partner to be as well. I am not into games, be honest with me and I will be honest with you. I am currently living in WA state but I will be moving back to California this coming May.

What I am looking for: A mature FEMME LESBIAN between the ages of 22-37. I am attracted to white girls, just my personal preference. NO GUYS, no kids. I hope to hear from a nice girl soon :)

Hey there 

Yes I'm resorting to Craigslist for a dating ad. I dont know many people as I am usually working and not into the party scene so it's hard to meet people. 


About me: 
23 

Financially independent 

I have arm tattoos, looking to get sleeves. 

Enjoys anything intellectual (physics, philosophy, political discussions, psychology) 

Id rather go to a book store or museum as opposed to a bar. 

Affectionate. I love hand holding and whatnot. 

5""6 and ""a little extra"" but handsome :)

Ps4 and comic book fanatic. 

There is obviously a lot more to a person than one can say in an online post, but there is a general description of me haha. 

Dominant in bed (but enjoy being dominated as well so have at it). Obviously I'm not looking for a hookup but figured I'd throw that in there. 

My ideal match: 

Within a decent age range. 

Employed, I need someone who is also doing something with their life. I haven't lived with my parents since I was a teenager. I like a woman that is striving for success. I'm sapiosexual so intellect and drive are huge turn ons for me. 

Please, please please be monogamous. When I'm talking to someone or dating them it's just them. I dont want to waste my time with someone who isn't ready to committ. 

If you are not over your ex or are currently into someone then I'm not the person for you. Again, I dont want to waste any more time or be a distraction for someone. 

Please have a good sense of humor. I love to laugh! 

420 friendly. It's cool if you dont partake in cannabis, but please respect that I do as it calms my anxiety. 

Please be affectionate too! 

I hope I find my person :) 

PLEASE READ IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS I WILL NOT RESPOND: 

Send a photo with your response. No picture no reply.

NO MEN
NEARBY ONLY PLEASE

Hi there

I enjoy going to the movies a lot and enjoy different genres and enjoy going often (and sometimes will see movies I really like a few times). I also enjoy going to Peet's Coffee for chit chat/ hanging out.

As many people are, I tend to be a little awkward at first but I do eventually get comfortable, especially if our friendship begins with email/text/IM chat (I'm also open to text/online-exclusive communications). 

I live in Hercules with my parents and attend Contra Costa College, but spend a lot of time in Berkeley and I drive. I enjoy going out alone but sometimes it would be nice to have a friend for some company and emotional connection.

Though I am mainly looking for friends, I am open to more if the connection is there (and I am just monogamous by nature and would only be interested in someone who is as well). 

Please no men and I'd prefer if you live not too far. I have made attempts to find friends on here and I received responses from some very lovely people but nothing ever happened because they lived a little too far for me (like about an hour, sometimes more, sometimes a little less) from me.

Hey There!
I cant guarantee you that we already have a lot in common but if you read on and find out we do, you should message me!

I want someone who will be upfront, honest, and i will do the same.

It would be nice to have someone who would enjoy going to San Fransisco, and of course trying out local eateries. There's nothing like a GOOD dinner and then going for a walk with a GREAT companion at SUNSET! But its give and take too, and i won't complain when you take me along shopping at the mall or while i sit in the waiting room when you get your nails done. 
I understand that being together is the most important part of a relationship no matter what we are doing(besides communication,of course).

I'd like to think I'm a simple no baggage girl. I have a great job.

I'm now looking for a relationship, but I'm no looking to jump into anything without getting to know someone first. 

Anyways i believe i wrote enough for now . Anything else feel free to ask or save for first date? :]

Hey girls! Just looking for one person to hang out and chat with. I am attracted to girls but since I've only been to the States for a year and a half, I don't have many female friends, which I realize guys can't substitute. So I thought I'd give CL a try. 

I'd like to get to know someone who's drug-free, easy-going, friendly, open-minded and active. Because I myself am. And whom I could call out on a dance party or a dinner time cooking at my/your place, who I could visit frequently and talk about random stuff and about life and family. I am very open-minded and stable, I love new experiences and learning new things. Although I am not particularly looking for sexual experience, I'd like to keep that open if there's real chemistry. I prefer you're around my age, active, in shape. Most importantly, someone who enjoys life and lots of positive energy. 

I like being in nature, hiking, excercising and just being active in general, I'm a competitive swimmer and I like doing lots of arts and music and a variety of other stuff. My strength is that I never get depressed over long period of time, I always seem to manage to make myself happy. I love singing, dancing, writing (songs), playing the guitar/piano/drum. I'm talented at doing most things but haven't seem to find something I'm truly passionate about that make me want to stick with. I'm a very positive person.

Anyway, I'd love to hearing back from you gals! Get back to me with a picture of your pretty self and a brief introduction to your self, including what do you love to do on weekends. AND... your favorite country to visit and why. Please be willing to meet in person, as I'm not into cyber friends. *without info above will be ignored. one-liners, men, perverts don't waste time replying

And yep that's me in the picture. I'm from China, speak Mandarin, English fluently, learning Spanish, French. Big plus if you speak another language and might be willing to teach me.

I guess this is where I tell you about myself and do my best to try and stand out from the rest of the people on here, right? Lol

I should start out by pointing out that I've never posted on here but my best friend keeps insisting that I ""put myself out there"". So here's my attempt, fellow Craigslisters. 

I'm 22, Mexican American/Italian. White, green eyes, blonde hair, chubby fella with an awkward stance. 
Did that paint a picture in your head about me already? Good. Let's proceed. 

I'd say I'm more ""dudeish"" I know there's right terms for these things. But I'm fairly new to this all so feel free to educate me on the correct terminology over coffee sometime? :p

But okay, I guess I can be girly sometimes. Rarely though. I'm more of a band tee/button up and skinny jeans sort of girl. 

Did I lose you already? I hope not, bear with me 'cause my thoughts are scattered all over the place and I suck at writing ""about me's"". 

At the moment, I currently have my own place, a car, going to school, employed, and I would say I have my shit together. 
I just lack that intimacy and that special someone by my side. 

I've never actually been with a girl. I've never even kissed a girl. Or well, that's a lie, I kissed one when I was in 6th grade and that's when I knew girls were for me. Lol

I'm a fairly reserved person, closed off and I keep my walls up. I'm not trying to throw myself a pity party here but I've been hurt a good amount of times and it's just closed me off to the ideas of relationships, ya know? But I feel like I'm ready. I feel like I'm open to meeting someone special that I can share my time with. I feel like that's one of the most valuable things you could give someone. 
You're never gonna get that back, so, spend it with the right person. 

I wouldn't say I'm an introvert because I do love to socialize but only with certain people. I'm a small group sort of girl. I'm into going to book stores, getting coffee, going to shows like punk shows, rock shows, indie shows. Road trips. Hiking. 
I have a pit bull whom I'd say is my son haha. I adore that dog to no end. I'm definitely an animal lover. Did you know cows love to be cuddled? I was watching this dude cuddle cows on tumblr today and it was really cute. 
Cuddle a cow with me so I know it's real. Lol jk. 

I have an awkward sense of humor, I apologize too much, and I'm really affectionate but you won't really see any of these things till I let my walls down with you. 

Before you hit me up, I need you to firmly grasp the fact that no, I'm not looking for a fuck buddy, no, I'm not looking to go to a club with you or go get drunk. I'm not looking for the love of my life on here or my soul mate, and if that were to happen that would be amazing but I don't want to be your project or your band aid. I'm not trying to fix you or add more weight onto my shoulders. 

If you message me, message me with good intentions, cause I'm tired, man. 
I won't lie to you, I have a heart of gold and I'm well aware of that. I'm just a stubbornass kid with good intentions. 

I've seen women on here post their zodiac sign so I'll tell ya right now, I'm a libra. 
Be my libroooo? Librahhh?
Not funny? Ok lol. 

Again, scattered thoughts. Bear with me. 

I'm an avid record collector. I'm really proud of my records. I go to shows a lot so a lot of them are signed and chances are that if I like you, I'll ask you to come cuddle and lay in bed with me so I can play my records to you. Haha

Uhm, hmm. When it comes to my preference of women, I'm not picky tbh. I'm attracted to intelligence and strong women. I'm attracted to open minded women with similar interests. Someone who would be down to try new food even though it scares them. Someone who would be down to go hiking on a Sunday morning and stay in and watch scary movies on a Friday night or go to a book store in San Francisco and try a new coffee shop. 

I won't lie, I'm a coffee enthusiast and a hobby of mine is checking out new coffee shops. I recently took this on in January and I've been to hella cool spots. 

I sound like a hipster. 😂

Hmm. More scattered thoughts. I am 420 friendly. I love to ride bikes. Wine is cool sometimes. Rarely though. 

I'm that kid who still laughs at the joke minutes after it's been said. I'm really clumsy. I strongly believe that it takes nothing whatsoever to be kind to one another. We all have shit going on, ya know? We're all fighting our own battles so be kind. 
I used to play the trumpet in a ska band. I can also play the violin. I've always wanted to learn to play the drums. I can't read music for shit, I learned on my own by watching others play. 
I'm really bad at directions and chances are I'll get lost with you at one point in our adventures lol. I speak 3 languages fluently. Spanish. Italian. And English obviously. I'm really awkward, please understand that, not too awkward to the point where it stands out but if you've ever wanted to meet Michael Cera, I'll come ridiculously close. I have a few tattoos. Charles Bukowski is my favorite writer. Making puns is a hobby. 


Hmm,. What else.. I dunno. I feel like I've already bored most of ya, so, if any of you feel like hitting me up, feel free to do so. It wouldn't hurt to meet someone new. Friends are cool. 

And no, dudes, I don't wanna see your chode. 

Kik me?

Ive been in and out of dating sites and I think the problem for me is not explaining exactly what Im looking for in the beginning yet I thought it was self explanatory when someone is looking for a girlfriend. 

So heres a list of exactly what I want and if you think It sounds even remotely someone like you email me. 

1. Im not here to find a fwb, sleep with your man or show you nudes. If you cant love me for my personality then Im not interested. bye Felicia. I feel being intimate with someone is like unwrapping a present and its magical, scary and akward...i dont want to expect anything. 

2. I am a true believer in dating someone before we get into something serious, yes I still believe in love at first sight but in the real world that barely ever happens, a kiss on the first date.Sex on the first date is not who I am. Dont push it. 

3. I cant stand people who cant hold a decent conversation I get alot of hey how are u, im fine.. Then thats it end of conversation forever... If your not interested in me say so and im going to be blunt with you as well, whats the point of lying right? 

4. I want to get married and have kids. If your not ready to make a commitment then its best we don't waste eachothers time. 

5. I am not into taboo, dominatrix, or bi girls. I am fine with girls who have baby daddys, I have one too. If your in a relationship with me we are committed to eachother. If you want someone else then tell me. If your going to cheat tell me. Honesty is all I want in a relationship. 

6. I am a social drinker and I dont smoke cigs... i prefer the same just dont be a chain smoker or an alcoholic please. 

7. You have Money, fancy car, and your own house....i dont care if you have everything or nothing... As long as your taking care of yourself thats all that matters. 

I think I have covered about everything. Hope to hear from you soon!

I've never had a committed relationship with a woman. Threesomes and hook ups, yes. Flirtations, surely. But the notion of actually falling in love has been on my mind for months, and I can't stop thinking about the possibilities. Recent conversations and viewings of ""Carol"" have confirmed this void in my life.

I'm a young, active, ultra femme, full-time pre-law student living alone in my own place in the Inner Sunset. I work for a top cosmetic company as a special f/x makeup artist. I'm a bookish intellectual, cat mom, plus-size model, and close friend to many queer folks of all backgrounds. I don't drink or smoke, but I enjoy drugs occasionally (for the sake of full transparency).

I've been attracted to different types, though I imagine you quite clearly: older, very smart, protective, dominant, around my height or taller, short or buzzed dark hair, tattoos, retro vintage style, butch/androgynous, rough around the edges. The ying to my yang.

I've typically seduced and topped women in the past, but they've never fit that description. If you do, I'll probably be so captivated and shy, I would submit to you. I may still get aggressive from time to time, especially if you provoke or deeply move me.

Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I am looking for a short term arrangement, open to long term. I nursed my children for about 8 years and I really miss lactating. I would like to induce lactation once again, but I need some help. I am looking for a woman who likes nursing and would be comfortable in helping me establish a good milk supply and maybe a relationship will develop. I am DD free, HWP and a working professional.

I'm not interested in one night stands , so I'm not posting this in hopes to get laid but hopefully meet a cool friend better yet someone I can vibe with, flirt with,,? Steal a kiss someone I like and want to see again :) 
All ages shapes and sizes welcome obviously you must be 21 and pls have a sense of maturity if u are that young. Older women pls be unattached without emotional strain but a open heart. 

Be financially secure. Have a good sense of humor because I'm full of laughter and witty responses. 
Anyhow I look forward to seeing you tonight for a drink.
I'm more attracted to someone's vibe than their face but since we are online u must send me a face pic for the fact I need to know who to look for when meeting.. I hate to say.. no pic no reply. Send a number so we can call/text each other prior to meeting :)

Wanting to relocate (haight ashbury)
Hi there. I'm a 63 yr old GWF, looking for another woman, for companionship, and partnership. Right now, I live in PA, but wanting to recolate. Wanting someone to share my life with. I am not seeking a sexual relationship, at this time. But I do like affection, and romance. I'm young at heart, looks, and lifestyle. It seems i am older then most on here, so i'm not sure about this way of trying to find someone, but since i live in a small town, and don't like bars, i don't really have many ways to connect with other woman. Maybe i'll find someone in a similar situation. I want someone available to put time and energy into a new person. NOT looking for someone far away, or who's real busy, or tied up with work, or friends, and family. Wanting to meet someone who is on their own, with free time, and places our time first. I like to hang out, and get cozy at home. At home we can dance, watch good movies, make healthy meals, read metaphysical books, listen to meditation tapes, and grow together through these teachings. I'm looking for someone between 45 & 68. I'm not a city person. I like the country and nature. I love long heart to heart talks, in person, or on the phone. I like to take walks. I'm a free thinker. I am also very much a homebody, but also enjoy the malls, department stores, supermarkets, book stores, library, park and beach. I'm health conscious, and looking for someone who is also. I am interested in Metaphysics, and Christanity, without the Dogma, and looking for someone to share that with. Eating healthy, and exercising. I'm down to earth, kind and loving, and very supportive. I am looking to find someone , who is non judgemental, and understanding, open minded, and not the jealous type. Relationships, should add to your life, not take away from it. Also, needing someone, that if an issue comes up, we can work through it together, instead of running away, and giving up, at the first sign of trouble. No security, with this kind of person. Need someone who is available to spend alot of time together. So lets talk on the phone first, exchange pictures, and seeing if we have enough in common, and make a connection. From there, we can meet eventually in person, but for now, on Skype, and see how we feel then. If we connect, see if we get along, and are compatable, and if there is a chemestry between us. I always look at the heart of a person (the good qualities). Also a good sense of humor is important. But a good heart is even better, and I do not judge by looks. I myself, have alot of love to give. I like someone who is laid back, and feminine, in a down to earth way, and medium built. Not wanting someone, too thin, or to stocky. No butches, please, or femmes, with butch sides to their character. I am fem-not butch. I'm real, natural, and honest, and looking for the same. I am spiritual, into metaphysics, and I'm a Jew for Jesus. Thanks for reading. I am clean and sober hippy type. BE CLEAN, SOBER, & A NON SMOKER! I am also seeking more close friends. I have alot of phone friends, but only one close person, that I see, and not very often.

companion in a romantic sense do reply. I think I will skip the picture ""NO!"" I won't

nor judge a book by it's cover but will want to read the contents of the story within

then I will discover the true beauty ............I know this online dating is a bit uncertain 

but I assure you I am pretty much an everyday person and have not escaped from any 

asylum.... Ha! Your picture will get mine I don't want us to waste our time eye appeal is

a necessity.....correct but not always. There is always something beautiful about a person

if we just take a few moments to look and listen. OH and by the way I like many doing many

things especially long walks at beautiful places. I walk fast so catch me if you can!

In addition to the aforementioned professional profile, I enjoy things Japanese.

Seeking Mature Crone Butch Dyke

Or Older Trans Gentleman (FTM)

Gray hair and soft middle a plus

Experienced, wise, stable, self-actualized, outside-the-box!

Old hippies, aging revolutionaries and free love seekers

Free love is not just for the young any more - menage a trois for kinky seniors :)

LET'S HAVE AS MUCH FUN AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE AT ALL TIMES!

Wild, Fun, Playful, Kinky, Safe & Sane

I have devoted over 40 years to personal growth and health.
I am the healthiest I have ever been and getting better every year.

Strong heart
Strong libido
BIG SMILES

Luscious, lovely, and beautiful inside and out

I am looking for someone with a good character. Integrity, honor, reliability, care and decency.

I am looking for someone who eats healthy, takes good care of their health and is committed to life and living a healthy lifestyle. It takes wisdom, maturity, self-love, intelligence and a good mind/body connection to make consistently healthy choices.
Are you on a pharmaceutical cocktail or seeking homeostasis? Have you become a POW of the medical system - sick enough to keep you in the system but alive enough to spend your ''health'' insurance? Or are you more like Neo discovering the Matrix? I'm not looking for someone to be perfect but for someone with a commitment to creating long term health to a ripe old active and fun age.

Please tell me that you gave up mind altering substances a long time ago or your mind has become mush. Sorry. I am looking for someone fully present with a clear mind. Centered, whole and mentally healthy. I am all of that and more.
Pot or a glass of wine once in a while is fine but ''medical marijuana'' has become an excuse for addiction for far too many.

WE'VE MOVED ON FROM LSD TO EST TO NLP TO AARP :)

Honest
Authentic
Emotionally Available
Secure
Open-Minded
Deeply Loving
Respectful
Politically and socially aware

Anti-racism, anti-oppression, anti-bigotry in all its forms
Love, honor and respect for all beings

Religion or no religion as long as you have a sense of connection to the greater good and your own greatest self.

I am an intelligent, magical Goddess, a long time activist, an old soul and a foxy older femme.

I am interested in meeting new friends in the area. I don't get out much and thought maybe CL could be an alternative to the clubs. I am an educator with a feverish love for music and great food. I have a special place in my heart for hip hop and soul because I grew up on the stuff. Meeting a woman goal oriented, driven, intelligent, kind, loving, humorous and comfortable in her skin sounds about right. There is something utterly attractive about intelligence. I'm a Family First type....my family... are the pillars in my life. My weekends are generally sketched out with hiking, biking or walking on the beach. I also have many date nights with self and Netflix :-). Sundays are for Church....and no you don't have to be a church goer for us to be friends. 

I'm laid back but active. AA 5'9 athletic, humorous and kind. I'm working on my sarcasm. ...at a point in my life where I'm noticing that it can be mean and annoying. Race doesn't matter to me... a good heart matters though. Put ""Good Heart"" on the subject line if you are interested in chatting

hey there, i hope this doesnt offend people. i am tall and thin. i like to crossdress. clothes from the men's section (especially pants, i have a 28 inch waist) tend to fit me awkwardly so i try to piece together my wardrobe from both male and female fashions in an attempt to feel more comfortable with myself. i don't smoke cigarettes. i love to play music and enjoy creating it.i dislike sports and mock macho masculinity. i'm not very competitive and in most cases i believe competition between individuals to be a waste of time and a worthless pursuit. i enjoy the feeling of being moved to tears by a book or a movie. i like to discuss emotions. i am more sexually attracted to an emotional connection than a girl's physical attributes. though i do tend to prefer a more tomboyish girl as it does tend to offset me. the more masculine qualities a female has the better. maybe if i havent scared you away and you think you might be interested, write me a note and your picture will get my picture

Thank you for posting ad. Its amazing the prejudices against Black woman, African American women who are here on craigslist. 

I too have experienced the same. Being SMART and SELF-Sufficient and adorable is a huge problem here on craigslist. There's too much discontent and hate already from society for loving a woman yet there are women here that promote the same due to skin color.

Ive even came across a few women here that were fine with my BLACKNESS cause they just wanted sex.

So much disrespect as if slavery days still exist disrespecting ""my humanity, my soul, my womanhood, my existance ONLY TO GIVE AND NOT RECEIVE. 

I AM PROUD TO BE BLACK, AFRICAN AMERICAN.

I see why Donald Trump is leading in the Republican nominations. . Racism is alive and flaming in this society EVEN IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY

Thanks for clicking. Just looking for a friend who can appreciate a sweet woman who happens to be gay & single. I could use a good friend right ...about ...now? It'd be good. We'd chat, laugh plan a hang out, laugh, get to know more about each other & the things that might be a big deal to us or not.

If you were feeling blue? I would a hug you? We all could use a good hug I hear it helps with our emotional intelligence (EI). I'm not looking for someone perfect as I 'm far from it. I just want someone who feels like sharing her good vibes with me & has nothing stopping her. Nothing risked nothing gained & a real friend (long term if you want it) is not as easy to find as it seems presently.. 

I am a delightful 45(+) & am only asking that you be ""mature"" & have a good sense of humor. 

Get at me, introduce yourself, let me know where in the bay area you're in. I mean, are we even close? What things do you like? Send me your pic, please. Show me who YOU are. Tell me what you liked about my ad or didn't like. 

Ciao, R

I'm a woman who loves women. Not just ""likes,"" or just is sexually attracted to women, or ""prefers"" women, I adore the ground women walk on...

I want to kiss the idea of you!

I want to catch your mistakes before they fall to the ground; they too are a part of you!

When I'm pissed at you, I secretly give thanks that you're here to be pissed at!

I would crawl a thousand miles to speak to you!

Aching to share conversation with you generates more energy than PG&E!

If I could reverse time, I would have been yours before I was born!

If I could advance time, I would have been yours before you were born!

Nothing is mine that's not already yours!

Spiritually, your soul, and mine, are ancient kindred!

Mentally, you're sharp! dynamic! witty! I swallow your qualities, whole!

Physically, our bodies are gentle and passionate, and they're done waiting!

This is our time!

Deep calling out to Deep!

Unapologetic Black Woman in Love

Yes, that's right, I have love for myself and all women of color as I share this honest and heartfelt post.

Dear Sistahs of Color, ever felt you had to duck and bemoan your blackness or culture to appear more appealing?

I've had more than a few women over the years strangely disappear upon discovering this well-spoken, highly educated, resourceful, family focused, blessed with a viable career, healthy and vibrant woman...IS BLACK!

At first I shrugged it off...""oh, they must have lost interest for some other reason.""

All the while ignoring the fact that we were practically engaged over email before I raised the infamous question of,
race.

I even recently reached out to make a FRIEND! We emailed numerous times, made tentative plans to hang out, as friends. Platonic. No romance. Just human beings who care about human beings. The email before our visit, I described myself as a woman of color. What did I hear back... Nothing! Disappeared! Emails abruptly stopped! 

People listen deeply...RACISM is alive and well in our communities of origin...in the ""liberal"" LGBTQ community...on CL....and deep within!

I'm now taking back my power as a proud black woman who loves women!

If you love your self some unapologetic black woman, some beautiful and majestic soft and profoundly unique black woman, some ""I love all people,"" passionate black woman, I'm excited to meet you.

I want to meet you. I ache to meet you!

My desire is to find my way home to the woman of my dreams and never leave her arms!

Period. :)
Exclamation Point! :)

Hello, everyone~ 

In an attempt to be somewhat safe with my information until I get to know you, you can refer to me as Starlight~ 

I'm 26 years old, going to school with a major in Business. I love collecting make up (M.A.C, Urban Decay, Too Faced, etc), i love to dye my hair. It is currently a mix of black/purple/blonde, reading manga, playing video games (survival horror are my favorite), and watching different kinds of TV shows. I love the beach, and when it rains, and music should probably be in my bloodstream instead of..you know..blood? I do like to go out to the club every now and then, and I am 420 friendly. 

I'm looking for a special someone between the ages of 24-34, preferably BBW, someone with a really good sense of humor, and occasionally likes to go out and dance on a Saturday night. I'm looking for a girl who has drive and sprit, and isn't afraid of challenges. 

If you think you fit any of that, then please send me a message on KIK~ 

Username: Starlit_Desires 

I'm a night owl, so I can assure you, I'm always awake at 4 in the morning. Send me a message at any time♡

Im looking for a relationship that when we meet, we bring our own vision to the table. Please be ready to talk about all the things that truly matters in your eyes.

No matter if gorgeous, smart or not soo attractive or how hot the chemistry... i will not be meeting and sleeping with you that quickly. Even if i really want to.

The love i seek is beyond sexual bonding.

Please 40-52 yrs of age... oh, im not looking for an email partner. All messages sent without a name and lack something about yourself will be deleted. Really, im a GENUINE SWEETHEART just know what i no longer tolerate..

I'm a very modern Japanese woman, a linguist, a rare breed indeed. I taught English to university students and corporate salary men in Tokyo. I am Oxford educated. Currently. I am on assignment in San Francisco and love the city. I intend to stay with or without my current employer. I am confident I can find work in this City with my skills.

In addition to the aforementioned professional profile, I enjoy things Japanese. I may be jaded, and biased, but I simply hold all things Japanese slightly superior: food, clothing, sensibilities, art, etc. Feel free to prove me otherwise. I'd love to explore other cultures, other sub-cultures and more.

Ideally, I'd like to date/play with an All-American Girl type, whatever that really means, but someone who is the epitome of the Women in the United States of America.

Here it is.......I'm hoping to meet a mature woman that would like to share 

time in this fast paced life we live. If you are looking for the label Butch/Fem

I am just somewhere centered in the middle and hard to read if that is not your

thing you will not like me. I am fit and on the petite side of the spectrum. I'm not 

prone to dating really tall women. I wear jeans mostly but dress up nicely however

don't wear dresses. I'm seeking a nice person that would like to do the simplistic things 

in life not into doing extreme sports! If you want a woman friend as a loving comfort zone 

a special someone to talk with that will listen and will hope for the same including a 

companion in a romantic sense do reply. I think I will skip the picture, not really! I 

won't judge a book by it's cover but will want to read the contents of the story within

your book of life then I will discover the true beauty ...I know this online dating is a bit

uncertain but I assure you I am pretty much an everyday person and have not escaped an

institution of any kind....... Ha! I am hoping for a sincere person and do not enjoy people

who simply find it hard to now follow through. OH and by the way I like doing many things

especially long walks in beautiful places. I walk fast so catch me if you can!

Our ages range from 23 to 48 and race and body type are also varied.

The most important qualities are that you be very nice, drama free, and sexually adventuresome. This kind of thing isn't for everyone, but for some of us, its wonderful.

No men, couples, or threesomes. That's just not what we're about.

Wanting to relocate (haight ashbury)
Hi there. I'm a 63 yr old GWF, looking for another woman, for companionship, and partnership. Right now, I live in PA, but wanting to recolate. Wanting someone to share my life with. I am not seeking a sexual relationship, at this time. But I do like affection, and romance. I'm young at heart, looks, and lifestyle. It seems i am older then most on here, so i'm not sure about this way of trying to find someone, but since i live in a small town, and don't like bars, i don't really have many ways to connect with other woman. Maybe i'll find someone in a similar situation. I want someone available to put time and energy into a new person. NOT looking for someone far away, or who's real busy, or tied up with work, or friends, and family. Wanting to meet someone who is on their own, with free time, and places our time first. I like to hang out, and get cozy at home. At home we can dance, watch good movies, make healthy meals, read metaphysical books, listen to meditation tapes, and grow together through these teachings. I'm looking for someone between 45 & 68. I'm not a city person. I like the country and nature. I love long heart to heart talks, in person, or on the phone. I like to take walks. I'm a free thinker. I am also very much a homebody, but also enjoy the malls, department stores, supermarkets, book stores, library, park and beach. I'm health conscious, and looking for someone who is also. I am interested in Metaphysics, and Christanity, without the Dogma, and looking for someone to share that with. Eating healthy, and exercising. I'm down to earth, kind and loving, and very supportive. I am looking to find someone , who is non judgemental, and understanding, open minded, and not the jealous type. Relationships, should add to your life, not take away from it. Also, needing someone, that if an issue comes up, we can work through it together, instead of running away, and giving up, at the first sign of trouble. No security, with this kind of person. Need someone who is available to spend alot of time together. So lets talk on the phone first, exchange pictures, and seeing if we have enough in common, and make a connection. From there, we can meet eventually in person, but for now, on Skype, and see how we feel then. If we connect, see if we get along, and are compatable, and if there is a chemestry between us. I always look at the heart of a person (the good qualities). Also a good sense of humor is important. But a good heart is even better, and I do not judge by looks. I myself, have alot of love to give. I like someone who is laid back, and feminine, in a down to earth way, and medium built. Not wanting someone, too thin, or to stocky. No butches, please, or femmes, with butch sides to their character. I am fem-not butch. I'm real, natural, and honest, and looking for the same. I am spiritual, into metaphysics, and I'm a Jew for Jesus. Thanks for reading. I am clean and sober hippy type. BE CLEAN, SOBER, & A NON SMOKER! I am also seeking more close friends. I have alot of phone friends, but only one close person, that I see, and not very often.

While we dont live in the LA area I am kinda thinking there may be a girl who wants what I want, to be in love with two people. Are girl like me who is very submissive but generally things most men are assholes and wants to just belong to one.
