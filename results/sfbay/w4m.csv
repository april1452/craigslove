Hi,

I'm in town for the weekend and would like to meet someone new. I don't live to far away and I'm not afraid to make changes for the right person. 

I'm looking for my hard working ranching or horseback ridding man I can share a life with. 

I was born in the south east of the U.S. on a cattle farm. I'm short, athletic curvy, with a great figure and a great personality. I love to ride and work the land. I also enjoy the simple things in life, like curling up watching the stars.

I'm in my early thirties, please be around the same. I also prefer my man taller than me, so please be over 5'10 with average to athletic build. 

I am looking for long term. Please described yourself or include a pic, which will get mine.

Ready for a new relationship? Perfect time of the year for a new beginning with a special man. Looking for ridiculous chemistry..... Too much to ask? I don't think so!

Call it motivation? call it being shallow? Call it whatever you want...

I figured it would be pretty interesting to have a really hot gym buddy to go to 24 hr fitness with. It'll definitely get me to the gym more often hahaha I don't really need pointers on HOW to work out..just motivation to GET to the gym. haha Once I'm there, I know how to work out. =P

What do you get out of it...uh...not much to be honest. Maybe just inflating your ego? Maybe I'll buy you lunch if you are cool and not come conceited jerk....which will definitely make you unattractive after a day or two. 

Open to go to the 24 at Santa Teresa, Almaden, or Hillsdale. 
If you're far from here, don't waste time. I'm not driving far. 
If you're looking for a hook up, don't waste your time, just because you're hot doesn't mean I""ll jump your bones. 
If you want a free meal out of it..ok..maybe I'll be ok with that. lol 

A few times a week would be nice. LOL Hit me up if you're interested in this odd situation.

Hello, I am am 34 years old from the Southern IL/ Western Ky area. Fist let me start by saying that I am a BBW in transition. I am currently a size 16 but I am losing weight due to having the gastric bypass surgery. I'm at this weird place in my life where I feel like im too small for some and still too big for others. I have long dark auburn hair (but I do change it up sometimes) Grey/blue eyes (that sometimes look green) and I am 5ft6.

I am completely single. I have no children, and have never been married. What I want more than anything is to change all of that! I would love to find a SWM in the age range of 28-40(ish), located LOCALLY (within 30-40 minutes) from me. I am seeking a LTR ONLY, possibly leading to marriage some day (No, I'm not interested in ""hooking up"" with you). 

I love a good sense of humor and witty intelligence above all else. Honesty, integrity and compassion are all equally important. Good personal hygiene is a must! (Sad that I have to explicitly state that). You don't have to go to church, but a belief in God is important. No alcohol or drug dependencies!
I come from a good country family. I was born and raised country and I love it! While I like doing things such as ATV riding, bonfires and muddin, I also enjoy things like going to a concert, comedy shows, Broadway shows etc. I don't really listen to country music (I'm more of a classic rock girl) but I'm not going to tease you if you do. My family are avid hunters and fishermen, so if you're one of those people who are in favor of taking everyone's guns- keep walking!

Physically, I a normally find myself attracted to dark hair and eyes, tall men, (well maintained) beards are good. I do like tattoos as long as they are below the neck. HOWEVER, I want to love your soul not your face! The only real request I have is someone who is average to a little extra weight built. Since I am trying so hard to change my lifestyle and eating habits I need someone who can support me with that and not drag me down with theirs. 

I know this is a lot to read so if you have made it through pat yourself on the back! Like I said in my title maybe I'm looking for the impossible, but you never know what you'll find unless you put yourself out there. If I sound interesting to you, message me! I will gladly exchange pic for pic after you send me one *smiles*. Please do NOT send me nude pictures or ask for any from me. To prove to me that you have actually taken the time to read this, type ""I read it!"" in the title of your response please. This is my second attempt here and 99% of the emails started with ""So what are you looking for?"" I really hope you're out there, and you're looking for me too.

Like most things, there are pros and cons to dating. Sometimes it may seem like a necessary evil on the road to finding love (and it is), but that doesn't mean you don't sometimes want to throw your hands up in the air and say, ""forget it! I'd rather be single for life."" The planning, the getting your hopes up about a new guy, the being disappointed, the feeling like there are no decent guys left in the world, we've all been there. They do say you'll find the One when you stop looking, so maybe it's time we just put that little piece of dating wisdom to the test.

1. Guys who'd rather text forever than make solid plans. What is he waiting for? Does he need a hand written invitation in order to hang out with you in person? Even worse when you take a chance and ask him out, and he still can't seem to commit to anything.

2. When you find out he already has a girlfriend. But we had such a connection, what do you mean he's not single? Why would he flirt with me like that then?!

3. When your friend meets her soul mate after being on OKCupid for literally 24 hours. How is it that you could scour that site for weeks and barely scrape together a couple dates, and she finds the Chris Pratt in the online dating rough without even having a photo up?!

4. When he invites you out and then ""forgets"" his wallet. Look, we have no problem paying for our half, but when it's clear he had no intention of paying at all, we have to consider sneaking out through the bathroom window, and leaving him to wash dishes to pay off his debt.

5. When his idea of a date is bringing his entire entourage to meet you at a bar at midnight. A date shouldn't involve him making sure his wing man has a shot with one of your friends.

6. When you think it's going well and he freaks out because you left a spare tampon in his bathroom. Or worse, when he accuses you of leaving it there, but it was actually his roommate's girlfriend.

7. The third time you break up with the same person. Somehow it seemed more productive to revive an old relationship than find someone new. You were wrong. Twice. Dating is just too much work.

8. When you can't seem to get past the first date, ever. Even when it seems like the first date was fantastic, somehow planning the second date becomes harder than trying to schedule brunch with Beyonce.

9. The unsolicited dick pic. Once second you were innocently talking about the third season of House of Cards, and the next, there's a dick on your phone.

10. Watching your friend go through a bad breakup. If you start dating someone, there's a pretty good chance that crying mess on the couch eating an entire bag of Smart Food dipped in peanut butter will be you in the foreseeable future.

11. Coffee dates. Unless you're going on dates at 9am, caffeine is ill advised. No one wants to put any effort into first dates anymore, meaning you end up drinking way more lattes than you should be, and every date becomes pretty dull and repetitive.

12. When he looks nothing like his picture. The question is, do you call him on it, or do you force a polite smile, chug that latte, and get out of there asap?

13. When he leaves you with the bill because you didn't want to hook up. This guy doesn't even pretend he forgot his wallet. He just doesn't come back from the bathroom. So that's why he chose the corner booth with no view of the door.

14. Finding out he's a racist, homophobic, pro-life, misogynistic actual crazy person. It's official, there are no nice, normal guys left. You can end the search now.

15. When staying home in your pjs is more appealing than going out. You could go on another date with this guy, or that guy, but why bother? At least your cat doesn't have uncontrollable gas or make you watch UFC.

I want nothing more right now than to be at the beach with sand between my toes and a beer in my hand. I long for the company of an attractive and down to earth man. I've been having a rough week. I would really love to relax with someone today.

Perhaps we could get dinner afterwards. Or just start making out. I'm an artistic lady with intellectual sensibilities. I hope to find the same.

We don't need to be into ALL the same things. So long as we have good communication, can laugh together, and luv on each other, the rest will sort itself out. Lets eat out, take drives, and check out this amazing place we live.

I'd like to find a man nearly my same age and location to hang out with and eventually give it to me on the regular.

I'm attracted to smart, tall, average built, clean cut, employed, good looking white guys. Well, not ALL of them!

I like a guy who is assertive, not aggressive or pushy. I love a guy who cooks. I want a guy who takes charge and listens to what I say. 

I'm not into attached men, cig-smokers, lushes, or heavy drug use of any kind. I myself, partake daily (when I can) and enjoy craft beer moderately.

I feel nervous and awkward meeting new people like this,... it may come off bashful or dingy, depending where my head is.

I'm not one to sleep around. But I'm not trying to pin down the rest of our lives either. Someone wrote, ""light and lasting"", I liked that.

I look forward to finding and getting to know a guy that turns me on emotionally and physically; a guy who plans stuff for us to do and wants me something fierce!

Please be local and age appropriate (within 6 years seem reasonable). Please understand, if not included , I will assume ya ain't local or a good age for me. That, a few good words, and a handsome and recent picture of you, would be nice.

Good Evening Gentleman and Wishing You A Day!

So why am I posting on Craigslist of all places? Good question. I have found that CL serves as a one stop-shopping site. Why not?
So where does a woman my age meet a Romantic, Classy Respectable Gentleman? Can someone answer that for me?

Will I find what I am looking for on CL? Maybe. Maybe, Not. Nothing beats a failure but a try, so I am putting it out there. 


I am a black female 50-ish who age gracefully, so I don't look my age and I also have a youthful personality. My appearance is easy on the eye and I don't smoke or do drugs. For my age, I have a decent body type, but working out at 24 hour fitness daily to get in better shape. I enjoy life and if we communicate we can learn about each other.

Following is the type of guy that I seek:

YOU LIVE IN THAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA

1) Age range 50-70 (mature, settled, sane, preferably average to larger build)
2) A guy who doesn't mind a woman having a little extra padding
3) A guy who is comfortable with himself and doesn't care about trying to impress his fellow man by having the youngest, hottest arm candy. 
4) Someone who is looking to meet a Class Act Female friend for companionship.
5) No racial preference. I have dated outside of my race.
6) Enjoy going to concerts (jazz, blues, R&B and others)
7)

I'd recently started a new employment in the north beach area (near the square)... Most days it's busy to the point where I just work through lunch and grab a protein bar to go. I'd love to be able to make a new friend who works/lives in the area who can convince me to actually take my lunch break and chill.

I am most attracted to military type, tall (at least a few inches taller than myself), dark or light (white, black, Latino, etc) men who appreciate a thick Asian woman. 

I am in my early 30s , Asian with very short hair, a lil under 5'6"" thereabouts, very thick n curvy. Educated, good balance between being mature and responsible and silly. Love to smile and make others laugh.

I would prefer to meet people a few years older than myself. Current or former military a plus. If you're into swimming, learning about other cultures and languages or bike riding (motorcycle) that's a plus. No drugs or smoking/420.

I do have a somewhat sarcastic humor but am usually pretty shy when I first get to know someone.

Please tell me a bit about yourself and send a (recent, no older than 3 months) clear face pic if interested. I will return same should it seem like it would work out. 1-2 liners will not get a response.

I'm a woman. A rather excellent one, at that. Seeking a man. Again, a rather excellent one... For fun, frolic and good times.

And yeah - lots of kissing and stuff if we decide that's a road we want to go down (ha! ummm, pun not intended, but well, we're adults - however that is NOT the intention of this ad - but it's one of those things that I do love - and you should as well - and again, we're adults...and - oh God I'm stopping now).

Are you single? (Not married or separated)
In your mid 30s-40s. 
College educated professional. 
You have evolved on a personal level and know that having someone in your life to share true emotional and physical intimacy is a beautiful thing... and not something to fear. 
Compassion, honesty, kindness, presence, spirituality and love are core values. 
Handsome, take good care of yourself, active? 
Have a full head of hair? Urghh---sorry, I know how shallow that sounds. 

If you're like me, you're not interested in casual dating or fwb. You want someone to love, be your best friend and companion. At the same time, you believe a healthy relationship involves autonomy and maintaining ones individual identity. 

I've been told I'm attractive, but you can be the judge. 
I do yoga and meditate daily. I'm a vegetarian and try to eat healthy.
I'm shy at first, but then I warm up. I am a bit introverted and a free thinker who follows my own path. 
I prefer small social gatherings or quiet walks in nature over big noisy crowds. 
I have a bachelor's degree in tech. Work is not my life. 
I'm a loving and devoted person...but not smothering and I'm very independent. 
I'm not perfect - no one is. 

I have an attraction to men with thick dark hair, big dark eyes, milk chocolate skin and pillow soft lips. Indian, Middle Eastern.

I used to think that, as an overweight woman, all I had to offer was my personality (which is pretty awesome sauce) but it turns out that I am also a sex object. Who knew? Now I can't wait to have a man use me for my brain.

I am probably most men's worst nightmare because I want a serious relationship. I don't need to walk down the aisle in a fluffy white dress, but I would like to get married at some point. I am not interested in having kids of my own, but if you have them, that is fine with me. So, I won't put any pressure on you to do these things NOW, but you have to see a commitment with someone in your future in order to get a response from me. 

I am a professional woman with a demanding career. I am ambitious and I take my work, but not myself, very seriously. I only work 40 hours a week, and I have many hobbies, so I am achieving some kind of work-life balance. I am looking for a partner who wants to make plans with me, but also wants to succeed in work and explore his interests. I will give you space, but it would be nice to know that you miss me sometimes.

If you are a mature and educated man, with a serious relationship in mind, I would love to hear from you. Sense of humor is really important to me, and I tend to be the funnier person in the relationship, but I would love for you to show me up. 

I have posted before but never seem to connect with anyone long-term. Follow through is important. I am a woman of action looking for a man of action.

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, inwhich city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

I'm looking for a man who has led a life of wild adventure and come the to conclusion that intimacy is the greatest risk of all. To be known and to know another down to the very core carries possibilities of being hurt as well as of finding ecstasy that no other human activity can offer. Do you have the courage to walk to the brink and take the plunge?

I am an exotic - definitely not to everybody's taste. I love science because it tells us where we are in the universe and I worship art because it reminds us why we are here. In my professional life I practice a little of both. The bay area feels both familiar and strange to me. Familiar because it sports the liberal values with which I grew up and strange because I'm more used to intellectual pretensions than spiritual ones and don't quite know how to fend off the latter except by falling silent. I hate the mystical and love the pragmatic.

My basic philosophy about dating is that If you don't feel nervous about a first date there's no point in making it.

Photos help cut to the chase which is where I always want to go.

Maybe it can happen, I believe in miracles.

You: blue-eyed devil (more like an angel tho). Honest, kind, single, available, playful, not a NSA type of guy, not really into one nighters. I am really looking for a long-term guy here!

Available to meet, don't get upset in email and delete me. Don't be super sensitive and delete me. Is there hope of getting more than one email from a blue-eyed
guy?

You never know. Over 45 and under 65, some hair on head and no hair on face is my preference.

Send me a pic of your baby blues, no games please. I'll send you my pic and let's start staring and enjoying.

I would like to have that butterflies in the stomach feeling.....

Would like to meet someone who knows to take the time to get to know someone, to share about themselves and generally be involved in the process it takes to go from stranger, to friend and more.

I'm looking for someone to spend time with. If you think you might be interested please email me back. I am 41, Indian, around 5' 5' tall. I am a big woman which means I am overweight. I am looking for a man that can see beyond that to accept me for the great person that I am. I have a positive outlook and a lot of interests. I am a smart and pretty easy going person and I'm open to what I'm looking for....as long as we enjoy each others company and can carry on a conversation.

I am single and looking to meet interesting and new people. 

Please be between 38 - 44 years of age, educated (at least a bachelors), professionally employed,. Please be uncomplicated and easy going.

It would be really nice to be with someone who would enjoy a good conversation over coffee, a nice walk, an occasional dinner date, or just share a burrito.

Please no smokers, users, alcoholics, bad tempers, married men, one-night stands, friends with benefits.... Have been there done that.. .Not just what I want at this point of my life now.

I want to live, I want to give.
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
It's these expressions I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold,
And I'm getting old.

Neil Young's words capture how I feel about finding a man who -- like me -- has a heart of gold.

If you're the one I seek, you're a kind, compassionate, caring gentleman between the ages of 60 and 75 who lives close enough to me so we can play together frequently. I'm hoping you share these qualities that describe me: educated, intelligent, and articulate; energetic and engaged; a non-smoker (of tobacco) but appreciator of wine, spirits, and the herb (all in moderation); financially stable and socially progressive.

Physically, I am of average height and weight (5'4""/~138 lbs.), and considered pretty/attractive...but attraction is personal. While I appreciate lifestyle differences, I'm best matched with a man who -- like me -- is Caucasian, monogamous, and omnivorous. I am interested only in men who are legally and emotionally available -- i.e., single, divorced, or widowed, and not currently partnered.

If you would like to start a conversation, I hope you'll reply to tell me about yourself and why you think we might be a good match. Be sure to include your age and location, and attach a photo. I am happy to reciprocate if we seem well matched.

I'm a 36yo Filipina with too much free time on her hands. Well, aside from my job, and being caretaker for my dad.

I'm looking for someone to chat with, get to know, share a few interests with; if things click between us it may turn into something more; I'm open to the idea. If not, at least we've become friends. 

I have been told I'm upbeat, hilarious, kind and loyal. I'm a bit reserved at other times, probably because I like to stay neutral. As in I always like to see and understand both sides of the issues at hand. 

I look pretty average, although my ex swears that I look cute, especially around the eyes. I dress tomboyish (because it's comfortable), but can clean up nice depending on the occasion.

I like watching anime, Asian dramas, and comedies. My tastes in music are all over the place, though my current favorites are Kpop and 90s R&B. I do appreciate jazz, since I've played saxophone as a teen. I'm a bit of a foodie, so I like checking out different cuisines/restaurants as well as trying out different recipes. Yes, I can cook. I am a trained artist (and have the BFA to prove it).

So I guess this is the part where I mention what I want in a guy friend. The ideal one would be either Asian or white, hwp, fairly good looking, under 40, share some of the same interests, and at least have their act together. They would also be kind, caring, considerate, and positive.

So if you're interested please email me, and we'll see where this goes. And to prove you're real and not a bot, put your favorite fruit in the subject line. (Mine's lychee.)

Thanks for looking. :)

Accomplished, successful, very attractive Black female seeking a male for a serious, long-term, female-led relationship. For clarification, this is not for sexual fetishists or to fulfill someone's fantasy. Although I am a novice to this type of relationship, after much research and review, I have determined that it is the best fit for me. It represents the type of lifestyle that I would like to live with a like-minded individual. That is, I desire a man who receives his pleasure from providing me with love, romance, emotional support and also seeks the level of intimacy and connection that I seek. Basically, he is my best friend and is devoted to me. He is receptive to my leadership and guidance, aware that although he may have input into our decision-making process, the final decision rests with me. Although I expect that we will have a happy and healthy sex life, I would like my partner to be receptive to the possibility of cuckolding. Types of punishment for my partner will be determined jointly as will rewards for his loyalty in ensuring my overall happiness and contentment. I have no interest in BDSM types of punishment(i.e: caning, whipping, slapping, etc.) nor will I dehumanize or demoralize my partner. Ultimately, together we will develop a relationship that works the best for us. Other characteristics that I desire in my partner is that he be between the ages of 37-55, intelligent, educated, successful in his own right and financially stable. He must have an Alpha presentation in the ""outside"" world but be submissive to me in the home. I am also a sapiosexual-I am sexually stimulated by intellect. I believe in full-disclosure; therefore, it is important that any interested parties be aware that I have had HSV Type 2 for 15 years. Because I have behaved responsibly, I have infected no one. I am receptive to any questions or concerns you may have regarding my status.

For those of you who may find this type of relationship and/or my status objectionable or offensive, I ask that you refrain from sending me vulgar and disgusting responses. Just don't respond.

To the individual who has determined that my post required flagging, despite the multitude of dick pics and vulgar requests notorious for this website, I urge you to find another outlet for your frustration.

The carnist guilt and hate is thick, and their sense of right to censor through flagging reinforces my awareness that we truly do have a government that does represent the ACTUAL populace, they personally like to sensor -even in personal ads.

Single, hardworking, fun loving, practical but creative woman seeks the same in a man. Life is pretty full for me right now, except for in one aspect...that special someone to share things with...whether it be in recounting the days events when apart, or spending some meaningful time together. 

My interests can be varied from crafts to a little sci-fi, current events to the great outdoors. Honesty, humor, a sense . Of humbleness and compassion are values I admire. I also value a person's ability to work with their hands. 

I enjoy getting to know a person for who they are as opposed to what they look like. But I know we all have some preferences or curiosity. That said, for what it matters, I am just your average woman, a bit on the tall side, a bit on the softer side than I would like to be, but I am active. I have long dark hair, fair skin, long legs, and a big heart. 
I do find myself drawn to taller, and somewhat bigger men, my age or a bit older (late 30s to late 40s).

Hello everyone, I am a 26 Asian female. Recently graduated with my Bachelor degree, and been having a stable job for over two years. And now I am here for someone who wants something serious (LTR) but willing to take time to know each other at first. 
**If you would think I am not serious just because I am taking my time to filter down who I'd send my pics to, then you really dont need to spend much more time reading. But I can tell you, if you are serious you will not judge the other side of the monitor with a photo**

About you, I'd like someone 
1. Who is a mature, caring, and also has a stable job, willing to take initiative in a relationship. 
2. Open to accept other culture, as I am from China; though I have learned to accept and practice American culture, I still carry some of mine. Be patient with my not so good English
3. Age 25-35. 
4. Do NOT do any drug, or smoke. 
5. If you have a couple tattoo is fine, but know your skin is not a scratch paper. (oh also there werent your ex's name, or something like that. lol)
6. Caucasian is a plus, but I am open to any race. 
7. Open to share about your thoughts, minds, and belief. In another words, honest. 
8. Someone who I would share my free time (and willing to spend his time with me)
etc......

About me, recently get out of a relationship, which hasnt been sparking for a while, and the fact it was ""foggy"" for our future was what really pushed me away. I would not say I am cute or in good shape, which isnt being humble or crucial on myself, but honest. However, I am not ugly or SUPER overweight. To me, how someone looks is different accordingly. Someone may rate me way too fat, but someone may rate me just right. Some may say I am cute, some may say I am just a typical Asian. 

Anyways, as mentioned, everyone would have a different descriptions on the same person. If you want to figure out how you would want to describe me, and you found my post suits you. Please do not hesitate to reply. I am open to answer question if you have any (Though, I may not answer.. Believe me, I am rather avoid your question, then lying to you)

TTYL :)
and good luck hunting!!

I'm an energetic outgoing single good black woman that work hard and can hold my own and looking for the same in a good man. I believe life is what you make it and it's twice as nice with the right partner. I do think chemistry is of the utmost importance; however honesty, integrity and loyalty are keys to a great relationship. I like doing thing inside and outside, traveling, shopping comedy; music concerts working out and plays in addition to cooking and just about anything as long as I am not harmed and at times watching TV with that special one just doing whatever.
I have kissed a few frogs and I'm ready to kiss my last frog to get to my life partner.
I'm a youthful 50yrs old, 5'7 a little thick in the hips (however no complaints from the men thus far) LOl love to dress up and down in a part of jeans. Oh yes and please send a picture if you would like me to reply.

Thanks

Hello everyone out there. I am newish to the area. I grew up here but haven't live here for awhile now. I didn't keep in touch with many people who still live in the valley and am not making friends at work because I work as a sub on assignment and I haven't been in any one class long enough to get to know anyone there. 
I do have a very short list of friends including my best friend who lives with me along with her 2 daughters. I don't have kids but since we live together I do have kids at home and that complicates some stuff. And afterall I'm looking for some outside of my house friends. 
Like I said I work as a substitute teacher and I aspire to making teaching a more permanent thing. Or maybe I will be a Mason. I have been enjoying the freedoms freelancing. I try to work everyday but there aren't always jobs and on those days I have plenty to distract myself with but like anyone I'd like to find someone to join me on some of these free days. 
I want to go visit Woodward Park. I've never been! It's snowy now and I don't have chains for my own car but maybe we can visit fish camp. 
My sister lives on Orange County and I drive out there often. This weekend that's where I will be celebrating my birthday! Maybe you like road trips. I love them. In the spring I'm going to Rock Fiesta in Arizona. It's a camp out and I'm not an experienced camper so, I'm nervous about maintaining a minimum amount of comfort. I would like to sleep well. 2 long days requires some good sleep. Do you like goin to rock shows? I do. It's one of my fave ways to blow my last few dollars. Sometimes it's worth living poor to end up seeing My Morning Jacket, Cafe Tacvba, Deftones, Tool or some other bands live. Let's go see a show together. 
Let's watch some tv. Winter is coming and Game of thrones comes back soon. Maybe the walking dead? 
I like going out for taco Tuesday and having some beers. The Tioga Springs beer garden is nice. I'd love to go back with someone. I've also been to Peeves Public house. They have good prices beer pints and an outdoor patio. Show me a place you like to have drinks. I'm a beer person myself but a mixed drink or some nice whiskey sometimes hits the spot. 
I guess what I'm looking for starts to sound like activity partner but it's not. I'd like to get to know you and become good friends. Maybe we click or hit it off or whatever. 
I into my 30's. I am single. Never been married. 3 exes in far distant lands. 
I like to travel and airfares are dropping right around now. Who wants to go visit Chicago because it's $150 airfare round trip? Let's go have deep dish pizza. Visit a museum or my college pub. 
I into science fiction. I enjoyed the new Star Wars very much. Can't wait for more. This summer's Star Trek is much anticipated. This is tre of probably everyone in the world but still with mentioning I think. I'd like to go see Star Wars again and I might go by myself but I'm putting the feelers out to maybe find someone to accompany me. It'll be fun. 
Having said a bunch of stuff and gone on and on I would like to now add that I am into 420. It my favorite way to relax and I like to go out that way. It's not an always thing but sometimes with other like minded people it can get to be. I still lead an active productive life. Clearly I'm not drug free and I know some of you aren't into that.
I'm ok with marijuana but not really much else. Drinking and toking. That's it.

I'm a normal, educated, and independent young woman, looking for someone special for a fulfilling and exciting relationship. I've achieved many of the other essentials and balances of a satisfying life, but haven't yet found the right person to spend it with. I hold a college degree, a full time job, make a great living, and find plenty of things to occupy my time that bring joy, passion, and welcome challenges to my days. 

I'd describe myself as someone who is very happy on her own, but places great value on finding someone special to share are build my life with. I enjoy having partners with mutual interests, as well as those who have passions for things I may not have been exposed to, as I love learning new things, embarking on new adventures, and shifting a bit outside of my comfort zone; it keeps me on my toes! As far as things I'm interested in, you can find me outdoors as often as possible as the weather heats up, marking up my travel list, finding any excuse to be in or around the water, heading out on spur of the moment road trips and bike riding. I never need much of an excuse to head to the movies, sing along with my favorite artists when they tour in my direction, or just enjoying the quiet of an evening at home. 

I work hard to afford an independent life, and am not the type of woman who is interested in you for your wallet. I'm kind, compassionate, respectful, affectionate, and don't find any challenge in making the important people in my life know that they are loved and cared for. My friends and family are important to me, and I really value developing relationships with people who have connections, interests, and passions outside of me, as I believe nurturing all areas of our lives make us better for each other when we are together. 

I'm 5'8"", brown eyes, a brunette, proportionate feminine curves, libidinous, and a confident demeanor, with pictures that demonstrate all of the aforementioned. I have no interest in casual relationships, and understand that solid foundations take time to develop. I'm drug free, disease free, and drink socially and responsibly. I'd like to think I'm a pretty thorough communicator, will tell you what's on my mind instead of expecting you to read it, and am content far more often than not, as I think there is too much good and joy to be experienced to waste much time on negativity and drama. 

I think I'm a great catch, and I'd ideally like to meet a man who thinks the same of himself! Being humble is important, but I think we also have to know our self-worth. If you've found yourself in a similar boat, holding out for that person that makes your heart beat a little faster, brightens your smile, and highlights your day, then I believe we may just be looking for each other. 

If you're interested, please send a unique message and enjoy your day!

Would you like to meet a woman who is feminine, but not helpless; can be affectionate and playful; does not make unreasonable demands; is not depressed and gloomy; is not a wildly emotional actress; does not drain your energy; leaves you alone when you need solitude; can talk and be silent at the right times; is at ease with you; recovers fast after a crisis; has practical activities and knows that naturalness is beauty?

Are you a man who is inwardly strong and responsible; has a sense of humor; does not pounce on faults; does not think cruelty is strength; is practical in financial matters; is above using threats and intimidations, and does not believe you must conquer the world?

Have you 'been there and done that'? Have you at one time perhaps thought you'd found your dream girl, only to find her turned into a nightmare? Are you tired of being alone and waiting for the 'perfect' woman? Are you tired of answering these questions? Good, read on.

Are you are a gent who would appreciate having an authentic loving relationship with a sane, cute, playful and petite BBW, zaftig woman, who does not want to marry or change you? Well then, hop on that mouse and tell me a bit about yourself!

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, inwhich city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

Grew up in Puerto Rico and the East Village in NYC. Been in the Bay on and off since 2002. Navigating my life towards being a professional performing artist. Have some pretty exciting projects lined up and looking forward to this change in my life. I divide my time between Brooklyn and Berkeley. Making a move to LA in the Fall. 

Looking to meet someone who openly communicates, is down to earth and really fun! I was told by my best friend that I have a type, which I wasn't aware of but here it is: Passionate, wild bohemian spirited,and die hard romantics who have that skater-Surfer vibe like Anthony Keidis. I also like soft eyes and maturity.
My spirit animal is Alana from Broad City.

I'm Puerto Rican. I'm voluptuous/fat. I'm a feminist. A reader. A writer. A film buff. A comedian. A trained cook. 

I'm pretty shy at first but after getting to know me, I can get outrageous . I really value my relationships with friends and whomever I'm seeing. I'm affectionate, loving,intelligent and driven and seek that in a potential partner.My friends say that I am loyal, loving, supportive, playful, passionate,generous and inappropriately hilarious.

I'm looking for a worldly, witty companion to share adventures and excitement. Well-read, well-mannered, and, well, available. No one in a current relationship, thank you. 

Have a connection on both the mental and physical level is important to me as it sparks the attraction- it also the search a challenging one as it's unpredictable. 

I'm most attracted to men who are intelligent, confident, articulate, witty (second appearance of this word!), experienced in life. 

Let's start with you telling me a bit about who and what you're looking for and perhaps we'll find a connection that leads to meeting. And more.

Now over 65 years young, I am still active, attractive, bright, lively, fun, and engaged; HWP (5'4""/~137 lbs.); educated, intelligent, articulate; politically and spiritually progressive; healthy and vibrant; an enjoyer of music, movement, wine, spirits, and the herb -- all in moderation (but cannot tolerate tobacco); a lifelong learner, turned on by all kinds of people, ideas, activities.

You are age-appropriate (~60 to 75) and live within a reasonable driving distance of the mid-peninsula. Your description of yourself is quite similar to mine. While I appreciate and respect lifestyle diversity, I get along best with men who, like me, are Caucasian, omnivorous, and monogamous.

Still there? Then please write to tell me about yourself and why you're responding. Your response should include your age, location, and photo(s). If we seem to be a match, I will of course reciprocate.

I'm serious on finding a good dom so please read my ad in full before responding.

SWM age 50+ who can host! Please don't message if you are mixed or just consider yourself white due to geography

Background: Just released from previous dom and due to dramatic changes with life we no longer have time to play. So his last instructions for me was to find a new dom who can contribute to my growth.

About me: Black female, I'm a small bbw, huge tits, big butt, almond shaped eyes. Very kinky and naughty. Sounds good? Keep reading.

Looking for...I am very dominant in my everyday life so in the bedroom, I am very submissive. With the right partner I am a true sub. I play right away but I will not submit right away. Meaning I have to get to know u and like you, and If I choose to truly submit to you I will let you know that in my own special way. I like to please, and I please well. You can I should be able to have normal conversations even if we disagree on a topic. I enjoy being myself and in general I have a fun silly personality and I love to laugh.

About you: I am NOT a masochist, but I do like spankings and want to someday be able to take in a good spanking and learn how to take pain. I want that to be very clear before you open your toy box lol

I could elaborate but I want you to learn about me through play and our own verbal interactions. For a bdsm relationship I would describe myself as a turtle and crab. I will not tell you why or how but if your a smart man you can figure it out. I do not want a switch, I want a man who is a full dom.

Other: I want to always be respected and taken care of. Trust is key. I expect honesty and I expect the same from myself. I recently married my high school sweetheart and we are swingers. I have multiple sex partners and I do not intend to change that. However, I do put my dom first, next to my husband.

You have questions? I have answers. Send me a message ;)

Hi, I am a 25 year old Korean-American woman. I live with my family and work full time. I haven't been in a relationship in about 3 years and I feel ready to start again. I find that it's hard to find a man that can keep me happy or communicate with me. I work hard and I put a lot of my time and emotion to that person when the chemistry is right. I attach to people fast, but I guess it's easy to get hurt when you find out that things just don't work in your favor. I learned to understand that more at this time in my life. I try not to be picky with men. I am looking for a man who can fill in the void but also someone I can build a future with and settle down. Anyway, I will be waiting for replies. Thanks.

There are so many great places to visit, adventures to experience, people to meet and things to do that I look forward to enjoying every minute of every day. I enjoy traveling and discovering the major cities (and country side) around the world. I've been to Paris, London, Rome, Venice, Barcelona, Singapore, and Hong Kong... My favorite activity in each city is to take a walk early in the morning. Every city 'wakes up' differently, try it next time. My favorite cities are Paris, New York, and San Francisco , what about you?

I am an avid cyclist, preferably riding up the hills than descending them. I also enjoy crossfit during the week. 
I am fit and eat as healthy as possible , therefore, somebody with a similar interest would be perfect.

""Soul-mates are not found...they're made""...it is our intentions and actions that lead to a successful relationship....I feel that fate puts us in situations (whether it be CL or Peet's coffee) and what we do from there is up to us.

Well, it's a little less than a year since you responded to my CL ad. . .and I'm so glad you did. It's amazing that we found each other, considering the magnitude of single people in the Bay Area. Having you in my life as best friend, lover, and the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep, and the first person I want to see in the morning has been wonderful.

That first date was really nice -- we were attracted to each other - both of us physically appealing and dedicated to fitness and good health - and had lots to talk about. And as important, made each other laugh. Things just got better as we started spending more time together, realizing how much we had in common and how much we could learn from each other based on our unique experiences in the world. 

I love that you're always up for a new adventure, whether it's a hike under a bright full moon or a road trip with a reservation at a B and B but everything else left up to what we feel like doing in the moment. The never-ending search for the best dive bar and diner, unusual films, small outdoor blues festivals, favorite and new favorite stand-up comics, and edgy as well as more traditional theater offerings. They're always more enjoyable because I'm with you.

I love that we've each learned about ourselves from past relationships and are clear on what we want and need from each other to keep things balanced and healthy. That we respect and accept each other for who we are and embrace our differences. But, that we communicate well -- not expecting each other to be mind readers. That we enjoy each other's company but can go off and do our own thing - and look forward to reconnecting to share the experience. 

I love that we have a similar sensibility and outlook on life about the importance of environmental, economic and social justice. I may be more of an activist than you, but I appreciate that you let me be who I am and fight the good fight on behalf of those that don't have a voice. 

I believe we bring out the best in each other and make each other want to be more loving, caring and compassionate people - who find the humor in almost everything, laugh a lot, and don't take ourselves too seriously. Happy (almost) one year anniversary. Here's to much more love, fun, and excitement to come.

(Extra points if you know who sang this.) 

As for whom I'm looking for.. I tend to be attracted to men that are confident, honest, respectful, educated, traveled, mature, gentlemen.. the kind that open doors and say/do nice things to a perfect stranger because it's in their nature to be chivalrous. A man that knows what he wants and goes for it. Someone who is understanding, loving, and passionate in the things he does. Sophisticated without being a show off is ideal. A hapless romantic and strong survivor who can handle this unique, educated, funny, sassy, artsy at times, adventurous, exotic, intelligent woman. (Stats: SBF, 5'5, curvy, busty, drk brown hair, brown almond shaped eyes)

If you need a list... the most important qualities that I hope to find in a partner are: 
Humble...Gentleman... Trustworthy.. Family Oriented... 
As far as age goes.... between 35-55 (give or take) ..... 
Height... I'm 5'5"" on a good day and a size 14 so I'm not a small girl but I'm not a heafty hog either. Just a thick chick... 
Caucasian..Latino....Asian...etc... 
Mature.... with a sense of humor because I love to laugh.... and just ready to be in a loving, respectful relationship..! 
Please don't smoke... No drugs.. No 420.. 

Reality is that Chemistry is a crazy factor.. and you can't feel it until you meet face to face. So lets go out and see what comes of us.. I would love for you to show me that chivalry, pursuit and strong men who make the women feel weak in the knees are still alive! 

I look forward to your response...

Hello,
I am interested in making a new connection with a special guy who is open to a relationship. He would probably be in his mid forties to early fifties, not a game player, and not looking for a casual fling. I am hoping to start things off as friends, going out for activities such as hiking and exploring the beautiful bay area together. Discovering great new restaurants, stopping at a beach for a picnic, going to live concerts, maybe a museum, baseball games, relaxing at home for a glass of wine and making dinner together, art galleries, so much fun stuff to do, just would be nicer to have someone to go enjoy them with.
So a little about me; I am in my later forties, Caucasian, brown hair, about 5-3"", not perfect looking.. I am small chested, but have a curvy behind. I am not skinny or fat, but could lose a few pounds and tone up. I am a little shy at first. I love animals and have two cats. I am looking for an eventual commitment, and even though I know it might be a ways down the road you would need to be open to the idea of getting married, or we won't be a match. Please don't contact me if you are already in a relationship or married. Also non smoking and no drugs. Thanks for taking a few moments to read this, and if you think we might be a potential match then drop me a message and tell me a little about yourself. Please include a picture with your response and more than a one liner.

I have driven the road myself, years ago, but I think it's much better to go with a new friend and sing or listen to some nice music along the way.

A lunch or fish dinner would be great, and I know some places because my ex was a weekend diver. I can buy my own meal, no moocher here!

I am short and plump, have some arthritis so can't do too much walking around, but do love to go to the pier and look at the fishing boats, or relax on the beach and watch the waves coming in.

I would like to meet a cool companion for spring time outing to explore the Bay Area and cultural outing such as wine tasting in Napa or a round of golf or tennis or sailing.

He is very well-educated, athletic and fit, love of nature and literature, good cooking, play tennis and or golf, fond of classical music and a concert goer in SF.

Having said that, I think meeting like-minded person and who is within a similar age range would be practical to develop a long term friendship for outdoorsy activities and reading and listening classical music.

I am attracted someone that is intellectual, smart, fit and athletic, enjoys at least one outdoor sport, and classy and into cultural activities such concerts and stimulating conversation.

To be practical, that someone special be within a similar age range, 48-56 y/o, and is currently single, of course.

I'm politically progressive, well-rounded person with a diverse interests in performing art and science.
I like someone that is a well-listener and patient, and has a professional career with a happy outlook in life. Are you with a lighter baggage that you have more time for romantic relationship?

The answer is yes, please respond with some introduction about yourself and recent photo.

Cheers.

I'm a moderately successful, intelligent-ass lady and want to ""expand my circle"" without any expectations of what's to come. A lady never reveals her age (right?) but I will say that I graduated college not more than 10 years ago.

Like others on here seem to mention, ""you probably wouldn't expect to find me posting on CL""...but hopefully it helps cut through the clutter to find other like-minded individuals.

Can you relate to working so much that it seems like you blinked and it's late February? OK, to be completely honest, life isn't entirely all work and no play, as there are hobbies and sports. However, human beings are wired to seek connections, and nothing replaces companionship, and not just friends and family, agree? While it certainly would be great to meet someone with long-term potential, I'd be happy to make a new friend with whom to share a nice dinner with good conversation. How does that sound?

I'm mainstream and practical in many ways, including being an educated professional with traditional family and relationship values, along with a deep appreciation for chivalry. At the same time, I'm very spiritual, and love connecting with others who similarly have a spiritual life and aren't too hung up on the trappings of the human experience. Beyond that, there's absolutely room to play, banter and have fun.

So, with all that said, if you think you might be interested in breaking bread together, why don't you introduce yourself with enough details to give me a sense of who you are and what you are looking for? Please be reasonably close in age to me, as well as in physical location. Also, you must be single and unattached. Including a picture or two is highly encouraged.

Whether or not we connect, here's to a great weekend!

Hello gentlemen, 

I am a 34 year old light skinned African American woman and I am interested in finding a good candidate for a serious long-term relationship. The man that I am looking for is seeking the same in a woman. 

I am not looking to jump into anything. I am looking to spend time getting to know a good man that understands how to treat a lady. Someone who is down to earth, family oriented and enjoys both staying in and going out. I am looking for someone with a good sense of humor that can make me laugh. I am looking for someone who is hardworking, responsible and kindhearted. 

A little bit about me : 

I am single, a smaller bbw, caramel complexion, long brown hair, kind hearted and down to earth. I enjoy a wide array of music, movies and activities. I am hardworking, responsible and family oriented. As far as race is concerned, I date all races, colors and creeds. I do have a soft spot for white men, especially redheads... As for age, I prefer a man to be between the ages of 25-45 but I do understand that there are some younger men that are more mature and some more mature men that are young at heart. 

If you are interested in what you have read and would like to know more, please feel free to reply. Please reply with a picture and tell me a bit about yourself. Your picture for my picture.

Hi CL,
I'm a curvy, white, attractive, female looking to meet someone special or just even some single friends in my area. I am NOT interested in a one-night stand or meeting a married man.
My biggest problem, and I'm telling you this because I'd love to meet someone who doesn't consider it a problem, is that I'm very introverted. I'll talk your ear off once I get to know you, but I'm quiet around new people and am uncomfortable being the center of attention in large social groups.
I love outdoor activites: going to the beach, skiing, hiking, kayaking. I also enjoy movies, art, music, bowling (even though I'm terrible), and trying new restaurants.

. . .just one man who is age-appropriate (60-75), close in geography (I live mid-peninsula), and similarly inclined (read on).

Neither of us is currently partnered, and we crave the steadfast companionship and deep intimacy we have experienced and expressed in past monogamous relationships. Living long has made us far wiser than we were in our youth. We acknowledge our imperfections and recognize that understanding, compassion, affection, and acceptance are essential to a lasting relationship.

We are both intelligent, articulate people, active and involved, socially and politically liberal, and financially stable. We're still healthy, energetic, and attractive, and we intend to keep ourselves that way for many years to come.

Here are some specifics about me:

I am HWP (5'4"" tall, ~137 lbs.) and Caucasian. Raised east-coast Jewish, for the past two decades I have been an active member of a progressive religious community that includes people of all persuasions. I am omnivorous, and get along best with those similarly inclined. Semi-retired now, I continue to seek ways to contribute my experience and energy to people and projects that make a difference in the world. Among the pastimes I enjoy are music and dancing, puzzles, cooking and savoring good food and beverage, hiking and exploring (especially with my canine companion), flowers and plants, computers and the Internet, movies and some TV, home maintenance and renovation. My social and political leanings are decidedly liberal/progressive.

I just watched an episode of House Hunters. A guy named Jeff with a best friend name Susy we're checking out vacation homes in Lake Tahoe. The whole time I'm watching this episode I'm thinking what a handsome guy. He's 6 foot four, 47 years old, and single. There was something about him that intrigued me.

Simple girl looking for regular guy to meet up for drinks/dinner tonight or perhaps sometime this weekend. Recently got out of a thing and would like to get out and do something rather than just hang out at home. I don't have any real expectations that this will work but hey it's worth a shot.. and well work is a drag at this exact moment.

I am 31, in SF, 5'8 brown hair, fun, smart all that jazz. I went to college, have a job and pay taxes.. I'm totally not some gold digger creeper like this place seems filled with. 

If that sound interesting to you, email me. Tell me your age, location and send a PG photo. Ill reply back if it seems like a fit. As I am in the city and would likely want to meet downtown where there are more options. Soma or Tenderloin are cool too. I prefer casual type bars but can feel comfortable most places. 

Also I am real as all real can be. Don't ask me if I am a hooker or send me a picture of your penis. It is a waste of time. Mmmk, thanks! ;)

I didnt know how much i was going to miss you when i was preparing myself for what was to come. 
I didnt even stop to consider my future without you because i always knew i was taken care of as long your around, and i would stop thinking about it because it hurt too much to go there. I didnt consider all the wonderful luxuries you made possible for me to enjoy and i didnt get to thank you properly i feel. 
Thank you for providing the best car i have ever had the priveledge of driving. Thank you for welcoming me into your life and making me feel wanted and the most important part of our home. For thinking enough of me to stand against everyone who had anything to say about our relationship. For being my best friend and taking my secrets to oakhill with you. For everything i didnt have to ask you for, you gave it to me because you knew i needed it. Thank you for making me feel and look beautiful it gave me confidence i never knew before. 
I just wanted you to know somehow that i wish i could turn back time and do ours over again because i would more amazing for you and make you so happy that your heart would last until after i left. 
My life without you is awful. You spoiled me and its hard to get used to not haveing love, or a vehicle or that welcome wanted feeling. I dont even have money for basic ammenities or food most of the time. I feel like an ugly scuzz who gets beat up by an abusive boyfriend like you see on tv. You made it possible for me to look desirable and established. Now i have nothing. Why cant you come back and take me out of this cold hell im in and ttake me back home and have all kinds of sex for years from now? And let me go shopping for christs sake, im better than this!

Love food (any kind, doesn't have to be fancy, just tasty). Love films, especially foreign and independent ones. Frequent museums and theatre.

A light at the end of the tunnel....I see it getting closer!! I'll be entering a new phase of my life. My kids are mostly grown and will be out on their own chasing their own dreams in less than 5 years. I'm seeking to meet a great guy that is within 5 years of my age and 30 miles of Novato. Logistics prevail if I want to get to know someone. (RECENT UPDATE: Before responding to this post please read all the way through to the end)

Although I'm independent I'd like to find a great partner to enjoy this next phase of life with. Perhaps one that has raised his own kids. I'm looking for an established man that has led an interesting life and has good stories to tell. I also have good stories to tell. 

I'm financially stable and seek to find my equal or better with regards to finances. I love the outdoors. Whereas I once used to like to rock climb, backpack and campout under the stars...my tastes for adventure have tamed over the years to easygoing hikes, bike rides, paddle a kayak and sleep in nice, comfortable accommodations. I still enjoy a good road tripping adventure and especially seek to explore more countries. Ask and I'll give you my bucket list. Nobody is flawless but if you have a good sense of humor, try to practice kindness and can use your resources to fix a problem then you're the guy I'd like to meet. 

I'm not in a hurry to ""jump in"" to a relationship but nor do I want to drag my feet. I consider making friends along the way a bonus. Honestly I'd like to have found a partner years ago but being a full time, single mom hasn't allowed much time for that. 

If any of this sounds good to you. Send me a photo and I'll do the same. Maybe it will go somewhere. Look forward to hearing from you. **RECENT UPDATE: To avoid spam (and those to busy to read to the end) please put your favorite place in the subject line. Thanks and wishing us both luck :)

I am seeking a man who wants to co-create a joyful and conscious relationship that celebrates life and facilitates growth, both as individuals and partners. 

About ME: 
- chronologically newly septuagenarian, but I look and feel 50-ish
- height 5'4"", weight 130s (HWP), pretty face 
- raised east-coast Jewish; now spiritually liberal / inclusive / progressive 
- enjoy wine, spirits, and the herb (all in moderation); intolerant of tobacco 
- own my home on the mid-peninsula 

About YOU: 
- age appropriate (~60-75) 
- somewhat taller and bigger than me, but still height-weight proportionate (HWP)
- geographically proximate (the closer the better....)

About US both: 
- legally and emotionally available (i.e., single/divorced/widowed and not currently partnered)
- seeking a best friend, lover, and partner...for the long term 
- educated / intelligent / articulate
- reasonably fit and in good health (no tobacco) 
- financially solvent / responsible
- active / lively / interested
- liberal / progressive -- socially, politically, spiritually 
- values-based, ethical lifestyle 
- kind, gentle, warm, affectionate, considerate, dependable

Although I appreciate and applaud ethnic and lifestyle diversity, I am looking to partner with someone who -- like me -- is Caucasian, heterosexual, and monogamous.

It's the guy who is well put together that appeals to me. It's the man who isn't trying to be the boy, the gentleman who knows when it's time to be subtle and time to take charge. One who values the building of trust over the catch and release. 

Here's a glimmer of my story; I'm not looking for the love of my life and you shouldn't be either. I am a bit old fashioned but not typical. I am loved but am lonely and one has nothing to do with the other. I am needing the secret that will feed my soul. I want to be friends with the one I am intimate with. I want someone attentive in the interim, can mix things up by having an occasional evening free, you're not too paranoid to meet in public. Someone who will feed the storm while being the quiet place to leave it behind. 

If you are the one who answers every posted ad, kindly don't respond to mine. I'm looking for a ruby in the mountain of rocks. The one who waits for the moment to step out of the shadows because he sees the chance to change the game. The one who knows that a whisper in the dark is as erotic as a touch to the skin. I ask for a man of patience, who recognizes the importance of courtship. 

Your photo needs to be accompanied by just the right words. My definition of a handsome face isn't always what society dictates. It's just a starting place. Make your impression wisely. The first ones do count. 

You are 45-60 years of age, and a tall man. You're stable and smart and for the most part kind. You understand that small talk is part of the seduction, that naughty chat is a lazy way to get there. You'll enjoy texting or online chatter rather than emails. You don't smoke. You're not looking for a super model any more than I am. You have standards, and recognize that I do too. 

Now let's see if you exist...

Hey,

I'm looking for a Catholic friend to go to church with on Sunday mornings (not to be confused with a ""friend with benefits""). So if you are only looking to date, this might not be the best option for you. 

I found a church I really enjoy that has great music, interesting homilies, and a vibrant community. If you have a favorite church, please let me know! I'm a very social person and am looking to meet someone that loves going to church, and wants to strengthen and uphold their relationship with God. 


Bonus points if you enjoy hiking and running as well.

A little bit about me: 
I go to church every Sunday and enjoy singing every song (even if I don't know all the words ;) !! I recently joined a bible study group and that has been awesome. I'm an optimist. In my free time I like to read books and exercise outdoors. 

If you are Catholic, please send me an email with the following:

-Why you'd like to be my ""church buddy""
