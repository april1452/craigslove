Hi,

I'm in town for the weekend and would like to meet someone new. I don't live to far away and I'm not afraid to make changes for the right person. 

I'm looking for my hard working ranching or horseback ridding man I can share a life with. 

I was born in the south east of the U.S. on a cattle farm. I'm short, athletic curvy, with a great figure and a great personality. I love to ride and work the land. I also enjoy the simple things in life, like curling up watching the stars.

I'm in my early thirties, please be around the same. I also prefer my man taller than me, so please be over 5'10 with average to athletic build. 

I am looking for long term. Please described yourself or include a pic, which will get mine.

Ready for a new relationship? Perfect time of the year for a new beginning with a special man. Looking for ridiculous chemistry..... Too much to ask? I don't think so!

Call it motivation? call it being shallow? Call it whatever you want...

I figured it would be pretty interesting to have a really hot gym buddy to go to 24 hr fitness with. It'll definitely get me to the gym more often hahaha I don't really need pointers on HOW to work out..just motivation to GET to the gym. haha Once I'm there, I know how to work out. =P

What do you get out of it...uh...not much to be honest. Maybe just inflating your ego? Maybe I'll buy you lunch if you are cool and not come conceited jerk....which will definitely make you unattractive after a day or two. 

Open to go to the 24 at Santa Teresa, Almaden, or Hillsdale. 
If you're far from here, don't waste time. I'm not driving far. 
If you're looking for a hook up, don't waste your time, just because you're hot doesn't mean I""ll jump your bones. 
If you want a free meal out of it..ok..maybe I'll be ok with that. lol 

A few times a week would be nice. LOL Hit me up if you're interested in this odd situation.

Hello, I am am 34 years old from the Southern IL/ Western Ky area. Fist let me start by saying that I am a BBW in transition. I am currently a size 16 but I am losing weight due to having the gastric bypass surgery. I'm at this weird place in my life where I feel like im too small for some and still too big for others. I have long dark auburn hair (but I do change it up sometimes) Grey/blue eyes (that sometimes look green) and I am 5ft6.

I am completely single. I have no children, and have never been married. What I want more than anything is to change all of that! I would love to find a SWM in the age range of 28-40(ish), located LOCALLY (within 30-40 minutes) from me. I am seeking a LTR ONLY, possibly leading to marriage some day (No, I'm not interested in ""hooking up"" with you). 

I love a good sense of humor and witty intelligence above all else. Honesty, integrity and compassion are all equally important. Good personal hygiene is a must! (Sad that I have to explicitly state that). You don't have to go to church, but a belief in God is important. No alcohol or drug dependencies!
I come from a good country family. I was born and raised country and I love it! While I like doing things such as ATV riding, bonfires and muddin, I also enjoy things like going to a concert, comedy shows, Broadway shows etc. I don't really listen to country music (I'm more of a classic rock girl) but I'm not going to tease you if you do. My family are avid hunters and fishermen, so if you're one of those people who are in favor of taking everyone's guns- keep walking!

Physically, I a normally find myself attracted to dark hair and eyes, tall men, (well maintained) beards are good. I do like tattoos as long as they are below the neck. HOWEVER, I want to love your soul not your face! The only real request I have is someone who is average to a little extra weight built. Since I am trying so hard to change my lifestyle and eating habits I need someone who can support me with that and not drag me down with theirs. 

I know this is a lot to read so if you have made it through pat yourself on the back! Like I said in my title maybe I'm looking for the impossible, but you never know what you'll find unless you put yourself out there. If I sound interesting to you, message me! I will gladly exchange pic for pic after you send me one *smiles*. Please do NOT send me nude pictures or ask for any from me. To prove to me that you have actually taken the time to read this, type ""I read it!"" in the title of your response please. This is my second attempt here and 99% of the emails started with ""So what are you looking for?"" I really hope you're out there, and you're looking for me too.

Like most things, there are pros and cons to dating. Sometimes it may seem like a necessary evil on the road to finding love (and it is), but that doesn't mean you don't sometimes want to throw your hands up in the air and say, ""forget it! I'd rather be single for life."" The planning, the getting your hopes up about a new guy, the being disappointed, the feeling like there are no decent guys left in the world, we've all been there. They do say you'll find the One when you stop looking, so maybe it's time we just put that little piece of dating wisdom to the test.

1. Guys who'd rather text forever than make solid plans. What is he waiting for? Does he need a hand written invitation in order to hang out with you in person? Even worse when you take a chance and ask him out, and he still can't seem to commit to anything.

2. When you find out he already has a girlfriend. But we had such a connection, what do you mean he's not single? Why would he flirt with me like that then?!

3. When your friend meets her soul mate after being on OKCupid for literally 24 hours. How is it that you could scour that site for weeks and barely scrape together a couple dates, and she finds the Chris Pratt in the online dating rough without even having a photo up?!

4. When he invites you out and then ""forgets"" his wallet. Look, we have no problem paying for our half, but when it's clear he had no intention of paying at all, we have to consider sneaking out through the bathroom window, and leaving him to wash dishes to pay off his debt.

5. When his idea of a date is bringing his entire entourage to meet you at a bar at midnight. A date shouldn't involve him making sure his wing man has a shot with one of your friends.

6. When you think it's going well and he freaks out because you left a spare tampon in his bathroom. Or worse, when he accuses you of leaving it there, but it was actually his roommate's girlfriend.

7. The third time you break up with the same person. Somehow it seemed more productive to revive an old relationship than find someone new. You were wrong. Twice. Dating is just too much work.

8. When you can't seem to get past the first date, ever. Even when it seems like the first date was fantastic, somehow planning the second date becomes harder than trying to schedule brunch with Beyonce.

9. The unsolicited dick pic. Once second you were innocently talking about the third season of House of Cards, and the next, there's a dick on your phone.

10. Watching your friend go through a bad breakup. If you start dating someone, there's a pretty good chance that crying mess on the couch eating an entire bag of Smart Food dipped in peanut butter will be you in the foreseeable future.

11. Coffee dates. Unless you're going on dates at 9am, caffeine is ill advised. No one wants to put any effort into first dates anymore, meaning you end up drinking way more lattes than you should be, and every date becomes pretty dull and repetitive.

12. When he looks nothing like his picture. The question is, do you call him on it, or do you force a polite smile, chug that latte, and get out of there asap?

13. When he leaves you with the bill because you didn't want to hook up. This guy doesn't even pretend he forgot his wallet. He just doesn't come back from the bathroom. So that's why he chose the corner booth with no view of the door.

14. Finding out he's a racist, homophobic, pro-life, misogynistic actual crazy person. It's official, there are no nice, normal guys left. You can end the search now.

15. When staying home in your pjs is more appealing than going out. You could go on another date with this guy, or that guy, but why bother? At least your cat doesn't have uncontrollable gas or make you watch UFC.

I want nothing more right now than to be at the beach with sand between my toes and a beer in my hand. I long for the company of an attractive and down to earth man. I've been having a rough week. I would really love to relax with someone today.

Perhaps we could get dinner afterwards. Or just start making out. I'm an artistic lady with intellectual sensibilities. I hope to find the same.

We don't need to be into ALL the same things. So long as we have good communication, can laugh together, and luv on each other, the rest will sort itself out. Lets eat out, take drives, and check out this amazing place we live.

I'd like to find a man nearly my same age and location to hang out with and eventually give it to me on the regular.

I'm attracted to smart, tall, average built, clean cut, employed, good looking white guys. Well, not ALL of them!

I like a guy who is assertive, not aggressive or pushy. I love a guy who cooks. I want a guy who takes charge and listens to what I say. 

I'm not into attached men, cig-smokers, lushes, or heavy drug use of any kind. I myself, partake daily (when I can) and enjoy craft beer moderately.

I feel nervous and awkward meeting new people like this,... it may come off bashful or dingy, depending where my head is.

I'm not one to sleep around. But I'm not trying to pin down the rest of our lives either. Someone wrote, ""light and lasting"", I liked that.

I look forward to finding and getting to know a guy that turns me on emotionally and physically; a guy who plans stuff for us to do and wants me something fierce!

Please be local and age appropriate (within 6 years seem reasonable). Please understand, if not included , I will assume ya ain't local or a good age for me. That, a few good words, and a handsome and recent picture of you, would be nice.

Good Evening Gentleman and Wishing You A Day!

So why am I posting on Craigslist of all places? Good question. I have found that CL serves as a one stop-shopping site. Why not?
So where does a woman my age meet a Romantic, Classy Respectable Gentleman? Can someone answer that for me?

Will I find what I am looking for on CL? Maybe. Maybe, Not. Nothing beats a failure but a try, so I am putting it out there. 


I am a black female 50-ish who age gracefully, so I don't look my age and I also have a youthful personality. My appearance is easy on the eye and I don't smoke or do drugs. For my age, I have a decent body type, but working out at 24 hour fitness daily to get in better shape. I enjoy life and if we communicate we can learn about each other.

Following is the type of guy that I seek:

YOU LIVE IN THAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA

1) Age range 50-70 (mature, settled, sane, preferably average to larger build)
2) A guy who doesn't mind a woman having a little extra padding
3) A guy who is comfortable with himself and doesn't care about trying to impress his fellow man by having the youngest, hottest arm candy. 
4) Someone who is looking to meet a Class Act Female friend for companionship.
5) No racial preference. I have dated outside of my race.
6) Enjoy going to concerts (jazz, blues, R&B and others)
7)

I'd recently started a new employment in the north beach area (near the square)... Most days it's busy to the point where I just work through lunch and grab a protein bar to go. I'd love to be able to make a new friend who works/lives in the area who can convince me to actually take my lunch break and chill.

I am most attracted to military type, tall (at least a few inches taller than myself), dark or light (white, black, Latino, etc) men who appreciate a thick Asian woman. 

I am in my early 30s , Asian with very short hair, a lil under 5'6"" thereabouts, very thick n curvy. Educated, good balance between being mature and responsible and silly. Love to smile and make others laugh.

I would prefer to meet people a few years older than myself. Current or former military a plus. If you're into swimming, learning about other cultures and languages or bike riding (motorcycle) that's a plus. No drugs or smoking/420.

I do have a somewhat sarcastic humor but am usually pretty shy when I first get to know someone.

Please tell me a bit about yourself and send a (recent, no older than 3 months) clear face pic if interested. I will return same should it seem like it would work out. 1-2 liners will not get a response.

I'm a woman. A rather excellent one, at that. Seeking a man. Again, a rather excellent one... For fun, frolic and good times.

And yeah - lots of kissing and stuff if we decide that's a road we want to go down (ha! ummm, pun not intended, but well, we're adults - however that is NOT the intention of this ad - but it's one of those things that I do love - and you should as well - and again, we're adults...and - oh God I'm stopping now).

Are you single? (Not married or separated)
In your mid 30s-40s. 
College educated professional. 
You have evolved on a personal level and know that having someone in your life to share true emotional and physical intimacy is a beautiful thing... and not something to fear. 
Compassion, honesty, kindness, presence, spirituality and love are core values. 
Handsome, take good care of yourself, active? 
Have a full head of hair? Urghh---sorry, I know how shallow that sounds. 

If you're like me, you're not interested in casual dating or fwb. You want someone to love, be your best friend and companion. At the same time, you believe a healthy relationship involves autonomy and maintaining ones individual identity. 

I've been told I'm attractive, but you can be the judge. 
I do yoga and meditate daily. I'm a vegetarian and try to eat healthy.
I'm shy at first, but then I warm up. I am a bit introverted and a free thinker who follows my own path. 
I prefer small social gatherings or quiet walks in nature over big noisy crowds. 
I have a bachelor's degree in tech. Work is not my life. 
I'm a loving and devoted person...but not smothering and I'm very independent. 
I'm not perfect - no one is. 

I have an attraction to men with thick dark hair, big dark eyes, milk chocolate skin and pillow soft lips. Indian, Middle Eastern.

I used to think that, as an overweight woman, all I had to offer was my personality (which is pretty awesome sauce) but it turns out that I am also a sex object. Who knew? Now I can't wait to have a man use me for my brain.

I am probably most men's worst nightmare because I want a serious relationship. I don't need to walk down the aisle in a fluffy white dress, but I would like to get married at some point. I am not interested in having kids of my own, but if you have them, that is fine with me. So, I won't put any pressure on you to do these things NOW, but you have to see a commitment with someone in your future in order to get a response from me. 

I am a professional woman with a demanding career. I am ambitious and I take my work, but not myself, very seriously. I only work 40 hours a week, and I have many hobbies, so I am achieving some kind of work-life balance. I am looking for a partner who wants to make plans with me, but also wants to succeed in work and explore his interests. I will give you space, but it would be nice to know that you miss me sometimes.

If you are a mature and educated man, with a serious relationship in mind, I would love to hear from you. Sense of humor is really important to me, and I tend to be the funnier person in the relationship, but I would love for you to show me up. 

I have posted before but never seem to connect with anyone long-term. Follow through is important. I am a woman of action looking for a man of action.

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, inwhich city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

I'm looking for a man who has led a life of wild adventure and come the to conclusion that intimacy is the greatest risk of all. To be known and to know another down to the very core carries possibilities of being hurt as well as of finding ecstasy that no other human activity can offer. Do you have the courage to walk to the brink and take the plunge?

I am an exotic - definitely not to everybody's taste. I love science because it tells us where we are in the universe and I worship art because it reminds us why we are here. In my professional life I practice a little of both. The bay area feels both familiar and strange to me. Familiar because it sports the liberal values with which I grew up and strange because I'm more used to intellectual pretensions than spiritual ones and don't quite know how to fend off the latter except by falling silent. I hate the mystical and love the pragmatic.

My basic philosophy about dating is that If you don't feel nervous about a first date there's no point in making it.

Photos help cut to the chase which is where I always want to go.

Maybe it can happen, I believe in miracles.

You: blue-eyed devil (more like an angel tho). Honest, kind, single, available, playful, not a NSA type of guy, not really into one nighters. I am really looking for a long-term guy here!

Available to meet, don't get upset in email and delete me. Don't be super sensitive and delete me. Is there hope of getting more than one email from a blue-eyed
guy?

You never know. Over 45 and under 65, some hair on head and no hair on face is my preference.

Send me a pic of your baby blues, no games please. I'll send you my pic and let's start staring and enjoying.

I would like to have that butterflies in the stomach feeling.....

Would like to meet someone who knows to take the time to get to know someone, to share about themselves and generally be involved in the process it takes to go from stranger, to friend and more.

I'm looking for someone to spend time with. If you think you might be interested please email me back. I am 41, Indian, around 5' 5' tall. I am a big woman which means I am overweight. I am looking for a man that can see beyond that to accept me for the great person that I am. I have a positive outlook and a lot of interests. I am a smart and pretty easy going person and I'm open to what I'm looking for....as long as we enjoy each others company and can carry on a conversation.

I am single and looking to meet interesting and new people. 

Please be between 38 - 44 years of age, educated (at least a bachelors), professionally employed,. Please be uncomplicated and easy going.

It would be really nice to be with someone who would enjoy a good conversation over coffee, a nice walk, an occasional dinner date, or just share a burrito.

Please no smokers, users, alcoholics, bad tempers, married men, one-night stands, friends with benefits.... Have been there done that.. .Not just what I want at this point of my life now.

I want to live, I want to give.
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
It's these expressions I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold,
And I'm getting old.

Neil Young's words capture how I feel about finding a man who -- like me -- has a heart of gold.

If you're the one I seek, you're a kind, compassionate, caring gentleman between the ages of 60 and 75 who lives close enough to me so we can play together frequently. I'm hoping you share these qualities that describe me: educated, intelligent, and articulate; energetic and engaged; a non-smoker (of tobacco) but appreciator of wine, spirits, and the herb (all in moderation); financially stable and socially progressive.

Physically, I am of average height and weight (5'4""/~138 lbs.), and considered pretty/attractive...but attraction is personal. While I appreciate lifestyle differences, I'm best matched with a man who -- like me -- is Caucasian, monogamous, and omnivorous. I am interested only in men who are legally and emotionally available -- i.e., single, divorced, or widowed, and not currently partnered.

If you would like to start a conversation, I hope you'll reply to tell me about yourself and why you think we might be a good match. Be sure to include your age and location, and attach a photo. I am happy to reciprocate if we seem well matched.

I'm a 36yo Filipina with too much free time on her hands. Well, aside from my job, and being caretaker for my dad.

I'm looking for someone to chat with, get to know, share a few interests with; if things click between us it may turn into something more; I'm open to the idea. If not, at least we've become friends. 

I have been told I'm upbeat, hilarious, kind and loyal. I'm a bit reserved at other times, probably because I like to stay neutral. As in I always like to see and understand both sides of the issues at hand. 

I look pretty average, although my ex swears that I look cute, especially around the eyes. I dress tomboyish (because it's comfortable), but can clean up nice depending on the occasion.

I like watching anime, Asian dramas, and comedies. My tastes in music are all over the place, though my current favorites are Kpop and 90s R&B. I do appreciate jazz, since I've played saxophone as a teen. I'm a bit of a foodie, so I like checking out different cuisines/restaurants as well as trying out different recipes. Yes, I can cook. I am a trained artist (and have the BFA to prove it).

So I guess this is the part where I mention what I want in a guy friend. The ideal one would be either Asian or white, hwp, fairly good looking, under 40, share some of the same interests, and at least have their act together. They would also be kind, caring, considerate, and positive.

So if you're interested please email me, and we'll see where this goes. And to prove you're real and not a bot, put your favorite fruit in the subject line. (Mine's lychee.)

Thanks for looking. :)

Accomplished, successful, very attractive Black female seeking a male for a serious, long-term, female-led relationship. For clarification, this is not for sexual fetishists or to fulfill someone's fantasy. Although I am a novice to this type of relationship, after much research and review, I have determined that it is the best fit for me. It represents the type of lifestyle that I would like to live with a like-minded individual. That is, I desire a man who receives his pleasure from providing me with love, romance, emotional support and also seeks the level of intimacy and connection that I seek. Basically, he is my best friend and is devoted to me. He is receptive to my leadership and guidance, aware that although he may have input into our decision-making process, the final decision rests with me. Although I expect that we will have a happy and healthy sex life, I would like my partner to be receptive to the possibility of cuckolding. Types of punishment for my partner will be determined jointly as will rewards for his loyalty in ensuring my overall happiness and contentment. I have no interest in BDSM types of punishment(i.e: caning, whipping, slapping, etc.) nor will I dehumanize or demoralize my partner. Ultimately, together we will develop a relationship that works the best for us. Other characteristics that I desire in my partner is that he be between the ages of 37-55, intelligent, educated, successful in his own right and financially stable. He must have an Alpha presentation in the ""outside"" world but be submissive to me in the home. I am also a sapiosexual-I am sexually stimulated by intellect. I believe in full-disclosure; therefore, it is important that any interested parties be aware that I have had HSV Type 2 for 15 years. Because I have behaved responsibly, I have infected no one. I am receptive to any questions or concerns you may have regarding my status.

For those of you who may find this type of relationship and/or my status objectionable or offensive, I ask that you refrain from sending me vulgar and disgusting responses. Just don't respond.

To the individual who has determined that my post required flagging, despite the multitude of dick pics and vulgar requests notorious for this website, I urge you to find another outlet for your frustration.

The carnist guilt and hate is thick, and their sense of right to censor through flagging reinforces my awareness that we truly do have a government that does represent the ACTUAL populace, they personally like to sensor -even in personal ads.

Single, hardworking, fun loving, practical but creative woman seeks the same in a man. Life is pretty full for me right now, except for in one aspect...that special someone to share things with...whether it be in recounting the days events when apart, or spending some meaningful time together. 

My interests can be varied from crafts to a little sci-fi, current events to the great outdoors. Honesty, humor, a sense . Of humbleness and compassion are values I admire. I also value a person's ability to work with their hands. 

I enjoy getting to know a person for who they are as opposed to what they look like. But I know we all have some preferences or curiosity. That said, for what it matters, I am just your average woman, a bit on the tall side, a bit on the softer side than I would like to be, but I am active. I have long dark hair, fair skin, long legs, and a big heart. 
I do find myself drawn to taller, and somewhat bigger men, my age or a bit older (late 30s to late 40s).

Hello everyone, I am a 26 Asian female. Recently graduated with my Bachelor degree, and been having a stable job for over two years. And now I am here for someone who wants something serious (LTR) but willing to take time to know each other at first. 
**If you would think I am not serious just because I am taking my time to filter down who I'd send my pics to, then you really dont need to spend much more time reading. But I can tell you, if you are serious you will not judge the other side of the monitor with a photo**

About you, I'd like someone 
1. Who is a mature, caring, and also has a stable job, willing to take initiative in a relationship. 
2. Open to accept other culture, as I am from China; though I have learned to accept and practice American culture, I still carry some of mine. Be patient with my not so good English
3. Age 25-35. 
4. Do NOT do any drug, or smoke. 
5. If you have a couple tattoo is fine, but know your skin is not a scratch paper. (oh also there werent your ex's name, or something like that. lol)
6. Caucasian is a plus, but I am open to any race. 
7. Open to share about your thoughts, minds, and belief. In another words, honest. 
8. Someone who I would share my free time (and willing to spend his time with me)
etc......

About me, recently get out of a relationship, which hasnt been sparking for a while, and the fact it was ""foggy"" for our future was what really pushed me away. I would not say I am cute or in good shape, which isnt being humble or crucial on myself, but honest. However, I am not ugly or SUPER overweight. To me, how someone looks is different accordingly. Someone may rate me way too fat, but someone may rate me just right. Some may say I am cute, some may say I am just a typical Asian. 

Anyways, as mentioned, everyone would have a different descriptions on the same person. If you want to figure out how you would want to describe me, and you found my post suits you. Please do not hesitate to reply. I am open to answer question if you have any (Though, I may not answer.. Believe me, I am rather avoid your question, then lying to you)

TTYL :)
and good luck hunting!!

I'm an energetic outgoing single good black woman that work hard and can hold my own and looking for the same in a good man. I believe life is what you make it and it's twice as nice with the right partner. I do think chemistry is of the utmost importance; however honesty, integrity and loyalty are keys to a great relationship. I like doing thing inside and outside, traveling, shopping comedy; music concerts working out and plays in addition to cooking and just about anything as long as I am not harmed and at times watching TV with that special one just doing whatever.
I have kissed a few frogs and I'm ready to kiss my last frog to get to my life partner.
I'm a youthful 50yrs old, 5'7 a little thick in the hips (however no complaints from the men thus far) LOl love to dress up and down in a part of jeans. Oh yes and please send a picture if you would like me to reply.

Thanks

Hello everyone out there. I am newish to the area. I grew up here but haven't live here for awhile now. I didn't keep in touch with many people who still live in the valley and am not making friends at work because I work as a sub on assignment and I haven't been in any one class long enough to get to know anyone there. 
I do have a very short list of friends including my best friend who lives with me along with her 2 daughters. I don't have kids but since we live together I do have kids at home and that complicates some stuff. And afterall I'm looking for some outside of my house friends. 
Like I said I work as a substitute teacher and I aspire to making teaching a more permanent thing. Or maybe I will be a Mason. I have been enjoying the freedoms freelancing. I try to work everyday but there aren't always jobs and on those days I have plenty to distract myself with but like anyone I'd like to find someone to join me on some of these free days. 
I want to go visit Woodward Park. I've never been! It's snowy now and I don't have chains for my own car but maybe we can visit fish camp. 
My sister lives on Orange County and I drive out there often. This weekend that's where I will be celebrating my birthday! Maybe you like road trips. I love them. In the spring I'm going to Rock Fiesta in Arizona. It's a camp out and I'm not an experienced camper so, I'm nervous about maintaining a minimum amount of comfort. I would like to sleep well. 2 long days requires some good sleep. Do you like goin to rock shows? I do. It's one of my fave ways to blow my last few dollars. Sometimes it's worth living poor to end up seeing My Morning Jacket, Cafe Tacvba, Deftones, Tool or some other bands live. Let's go see a show together. 
Let's watch some tv. Winter is coming and Game of thrones comes back soon. Maybe the walking dead? 
I like going out for taco Tuesday and having some beers. The Tioga Springs beer garden is nice. I'd love to go back with someone. I've also been to Peeves Public house. They have good prices beer pints and an outdoor patio. Show me a place you like to have drinks. I'm a beer person myself but a mixed drink or some nice whiskey sometimes hits the spot. 
I guess what I'm looking for starts to sound like activity partner but it's not. I'd like to get to know you and become good friends. Maybe we click or hit it off or whatever. 
I into my 30's. I am single. Never been married. 3 exes in far distant lands. 
I like to travel and airfares are dropping right around now. Who wants to go visit Chicago because it's $150 airfare round trip? Let's go have deep dish pizza. Visit a museum or my college pub. 
I into science fiction. I enjoyed the new Star Wars very much. Can't wait for more. This summer's Star Trek is much anticipated. This is tre of probably everyone in the world but still with mentioning I think. I'd like to go see Star Wars again and I might go by myself but I'm putting the feelers out to maybe find someone to accompany me. It'll be fun. 
Having said a bunch of stuff and gone on and on I would like to now add that I am into 420. It my favorite way to relax and I like to go out that way. It's not an always thing but sometimes with other like minded people it can get to be. I still lead an active productive life. Clearly I'm not drug free and I know some of you aren't into that.
I'm ok with marijuana but not really much else. Drinking and toking. That's it.

I'm a normal, educated, and independent young woman, looking for someone special for a fulfilling and exciting relationship. I've achieved many of the other essentials and balances of a satisfying life, but haven't yet found the right person to spend it with. I hold a college degree, a full time job, make a great living, and find plenty of things to occupy my time that bring joy, passion, and welcome challenges to my days. 

I'd describe myself as someone who is very happy on her own, but places great value on finding someone special to share are build my life with. I enjoy having partners with mutual interests, as well as those who have passions for things I may not have been exposed to, as I love learning new things, embarking on new adventures, and shifting a bit outside of my comfort zone; it keeps me on my toes! As far as things I'm interested in, you can find me outdoors as often as possible as the weather heats up, marking up my travel list, finding any excuse to be in or around the water, heading out on spur of the moment road trips and bike riding. I never need much of an excuse to head to the movies, sing along with my favorite artists when they tour in my direction, or just enjoying the quiet of an evening at home. 

I work hard to afford an independent life, and am not the type of woman who is interested in you for your wallet. I'm kind, compassionate, respectful, affectionate, and don't find any challenge in making the important people in my life know that they are loved and cared for. My friends and family are important to me, and I really value developing relationships with people who have connections, interests, and passions outside of me, as I believe nurturing all areas of our lives make us better for each other when we are together. 

I'm 5'8"", brown eyes, a brunette, proportionate feminine curves, libidinous, and a confident demeanor, with pictures that demonstrate all of the aforementioned. I have no interest in casual relationships, and understand that solid foundations take time to develop. I'm drug free, disease free, and drink socially and responsibly. I'd like to think I'm a pretty thorough communicator, will tell you what's on my mind instead of expecting you to read it, and am content far more often than not, as I think there is too much good and joy to be experienced to waste much time on negativity and drama. 

I think I'm a great catch, and I'd ideally like to meet a man who thinks the same of himself! Being humble is important, but I think we also have to know our self-worth. If you've found yourself in a similar boat, holding out for that person that makes your heart beat a little faster, brightens your smile, and highlights your day, then I believe we may just be looking for each other. 

If you're interested, please send a unique message and enjoy your day!

Would you like to meet a woman who is feminine, but not helpless; can be affectionate and playful; does not make unreasonable demands; is not depressed and gloomy; is not a wildly emotional actress; does not drain your energy; leaves you alone when you need solitude; can talk and be silent at the right times; is at ease with you; recovers fast after a crisis; has practical activities and knows that naturalness is beauty?

Are you a man who is inwardly strong and responsible; has a sense of humor; does not pounce on faults; does not think cruelty is strength; is practical in financial matters; is above using threats and intimidations, and does not believe you must conquer the world?

Have you 'been there and done that'? Have you at one time perhaps thought you'd found your dream girl, only to find her turned into a nightmare? Are you tired of being alone and waiting for the 'perfect' woman? Are you tired of answering these questions? Good, read on.

Are you are a gent who would appreciate having an authentic loving relationship with a sane, cute, playful and petite BBW, zaftig woman, who does not want to marry or change you? Well then, hop on that mouse and tell me a bit about yourself!

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, inwhich city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

Grew up in Puerto Rico and the East Village in NYC. Been in the Bay on and off since 2002. Navigating my life towards being a professional performing artist. Have some pretty exciting projects lined up and looking forward to this change in my life. I divide my time between Brooklyn and Berkeley. Making a move to LA in the Fall. 

Looking to meet someone who openly communicates, is down to earth and really fun! I was told by my best friend that I have a type, which I wasn't aware of but here it is: Passionate, wild bohemian spirited,and die hard romantics who have that skater-Surfer vibe like Anthony Keidis. I also like soft eyes and maturity.
My spirit animal is Alana from Broad City.

I'm Puerto Rican. I'm voluptuous/fat. I'm a feminist. A reader. A writer. A film buff. A comedian. A trained cook. 

I'm pretty shy at first but after getting to know me, I can get outrageous . I really value my relationships with friends and whomever I'm seeing. I'm affectionate, loving,intelligent and driven and seek that in a potential partner.My friends say that I am loyal, loving, supportive, playful, passionate,generous and inappropriately hilarious.

I'm looking for a worldly, witty companion to share adventures and excitement. Well-read, well-mannered, and, well, available. No one in a current relationship, thank you. 

Have a connection on both the mental and physical level is important to me as it sparks the attraction- it also the search a challenging one as it's unpredictable. 

I'm most attracted to men who are intelligent, confident, articulate, witty (second appearance of this word!), experienced in life. 

Let's start with you telling me a bit about who and what you're looking for and perhaps we'll find a connection that leads to meeting. And more.

Now over 65 years young, I am still active, attractive, bright, lively, fun, and engaged; HWP (5'4""/~137 lbs.); educated, intelligent, articulate; politically and spiritually progressive; healthy and vibrant; an enjoyer of music, movement, wine, spirits, and the herb -- all in moderation (but cannot tolerate tobacco); a lifelong learner, turned on by all kinds of people, ideas, activities.

You are age-appropriate (~60 to 75) and live within a reasonable driving distance of the mid-peninsula. Your description of yourself is quite similar to mine. While I appreciate and respect lifestyle diversity, I get along best with men who, like me, are Caucasian, omnivorous, and monogamous.

Still there? Then please write to tell me about yourself and why you're responding. Your response should include your age, location, and photo(s). If we seem to be a match, I will of course reciprocate.

I'm serious on finding a good dom so please read my ad in full before responding.

SWM age 50+ who can host! Please don't message if you are mixed or just consider yourself white due to geography

Background: Just released from previous dom and due to dramatic changes with life we no longer have time to play. So his last instructions for me was to find a new dom who can contribute to my growth.

About me: Black female, I'm a small bbw, huge tits, big butt, almond shaped eyes. Very kinky and naughty. Sounds good? Keep reading.

Looking for...I am very dominant in my everyday life so in the bedroom, I am very submissive. With the right partner I am a true sub. I play right away but I will not submit right away. Meaning I have to get to know u and like you, and If I choose to truly submit to you I will let you know that in my own special way. I like to please, and I please well. You can I should be able to have normal conversations even if we disagree on a topic. I enjoy being myself and in general I have a fun silly personality and I love to laugh.

About you: I am NOT a masochist, but I do like spankings and want to someday be able to take in a good spanking and learn how to take pain. I want that to be very clear before you open your toy box lol

I could elaborate but I want you to learn about me through play and our own verbal interactions. For a bdsm relationship I would describe myself as a turtle and crab. I will not tell you why or how but if your a smart man you can figure it out. I do not want a switch, I want a man who is a full dom.

Other: I want to always be respected and taken care of. Trust is key. I expect honesty and I expect the same from myself. I recently married my high school sweetheart and we are swingers. I have multiple sex partners and I do not intend to change that. However, I do put my dom first, next to my husband.

You have questions? I have answers. Send me a message ;)

Hi, I am a 25 year old Korean-American woman. I live with my family and work full time. I haven't been in a relationship in about 3 years and I feel ready to start again. I find that it's hard to find a man that can keep me happy or communicate with me. I work hard and I put a lot of my time and emotion to that person when the chemistry is right. I attach to people fast, but I guess it's easy to get hurt when you find out that things just don't work in your favor. I learned to understand that more at this time in my life. I try not to be picky with men. I am looking for a man who can fill in the void but also someone I can build a future with and settle down. Anyway, I will be waiting for replies. Thanks.

There are so many great places to visit, adventures to experience, people to meet and things to do that I look forward to enjoying every minute of every day. I enjoy traveling and discovering the major cities (and country side) around the world. I've been to Paris, London, Rome, Venice, Barcelona, Singapore, and Hong Kong... My favorite activity in each city is to take a walk early in the morning. Every city 'wakes up' differently, try it next time. My favorite cities are Paris, New York, and San Francisco , what about you?

I am an avid cyclist, preferably riding up the hills than descending them. I also enjoy crossfit during the week. 
I am fit and eat as healthy as possible , therefore, somebody with a similar interest would be perfect.

""Soul-mates are not found...they're made""...it is our intentions and actions that lead to a successful relationship....I feel that fate puts us in situations (whether it be CL or Peet's coffee) and what we do from there is up to us.

Well, it's a little less than a year since you responded to my CL ad. . .and I'm so glad you did. It's amazing that we found each other, considering the magnitude of single people in the Bay Area. Having you in my life as best friend, lover, and the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep, and the first person I want to see in the morning has been wonderful.

That first date was really nice -- we were attracted to each other - both of us physically appealing and dedicated to fitness and good health - and had lots to talk about. And as important, made each other laugh. Things just got better as we started spending more time together, realizing how much we had in common and how much we could learn from each other based on our unique experiences in the world. 

I love that you're always up for a new adventure, whether it's a hike under a bright full moon or a road trip with a reservation at a B and B but everything else left up to what we feel like doing in the moment. The never-ending search for the best dive bar and diner, unusual films, small outdoor blues festivals, favorite and new favorite stand-up comics, and edgy as well as more traditional theater offerings. They're always more enjoyable because I'm with you.

I love that we've each learned about ourselves from past relationships and are clear on what we want and need from each other to keep things balanced and healthy. That we respect and accept each other for who we are and embrace our differences. But, that we communicate well -- not expecting each other to be mind readers. That we enjoy each other's company but can go off and do our own thing - and look forward to reconnecting to share the experience. 

I love that we have a similar sensibility and outlook on life about the importance of environmental, economic and social justice. I may be more of an activist than you, but I appreciate that you let me be who I am and fight the good fight on behalf of those that don't have a voice. 

I believe we bring out the best in each other and make each other want to be more loving, caring and compassionate people - who find the humor in almost everything, laugh a lot, and don't take ourselves too seriously. Happy (almost) one year anniversary. Here's to much more love, fun, and excitement to come.

(Extra points if you know who sang this.) 

As for whom I'm looking for.. I tend to be attracted to men that are confident, honest, respectful, educated, traveled, mature, gentlemen.. the kind that open doors and say/do nice things to a perfect stranger because it's in their nature to be chivalrous. A man that knows what he wants and goes for it. Someone who is understanding, loving, and passionate in the things he does. Sophisticated without being a show off is ideal. A hapless romantic and strong survivor who can handle this unique, educated, funny, sassy, artsy at times, adventurous, exotic, intelligent woman. (Stats: SBF, 5'5, curvy, busty, drk brown hair, brown almond shaped eyes)

If you need a list... the most important qualities that I hope to find in a partner are: 
Humble...Gentleman... Trustworthy.. Family Oriented... 
As far as age goes.... between 35-55 (give or take) ..... 
Height... I'm 5'5"" on a good day and a size 14 so I'm not a small girl but I'm not a heafty hog either. Just a thick chick... 
Caucasian..Latino....Asian...etc... 
Mature.... with a sense of humor because I love to laugh.... and just ready to be in a loving, respectful relationship..! 
Please don't smoke... No drugs.. No 420.. 

Reality is that Chemistry is a crazy factor.. and you can't feel it until you meet face to face. So lets go out and see what comes of us.. I would love for you to show me that chivalry, pursuit and strong men who make the women feel weak in the knees are still alive! 

I look forward to your response...

Hello,
I am interested in making a new connection with a special guy who is open to a relationship. He would probably be in his mid forties to early fifties, not a game player, and not looking for a casual fling. I am hoping to start things off as friends, going out for activities such as hiking and exploring the beautiful bay area together. Discovering great new restaurants, stopping at a beach for a picnic, going to live concerts, maybe a museum, baseball games, relaxing at home for a glass of wine and making dinner together, art galleries, so much fun stuff to do, just would be nicer to have someone to go enjoy them with.
So a little about me; I am in my later forties, Caucasian, brown hair, about 5-3"", not perfect looking.. I am small chested, but have a curvy behind. I am not skinny or fat, but could lose a few pounds and tone up. I am a little shy at first. I love animals and have two cats. I am looking for an eventual commitment, and even though I know it might be a ways down the road you would need to be open to the idea of getting married, or we won't be a match. Please don't contact me if you are already in a relationship or married. Also non smoking and no drugs. Thanks for taking a few moments to read this, and if you think we might be a potential match then drop me a message and tell me a little about yourself. Please include a picture with your response and more than a one liner.

I have driven the road myself, years ago, but I think it's much better to go with a new friend and sing or listen to some nice music along the way.

A lunch or fish dinner would be great, and I know some places because my ex was a weekend diver. I can buy my own meal, no moocher here!

I am short and plump, have some arthritis so can't do too much walking around, but do love to go to the pier and look at the fishing boats, or relax on the beach and watch the waves coming in.

I would like to meet a cool companion for spring time outing to explore the Bay Area and cultural outing such as wine tasting in Napa or a round of golf or tennis or sailing.

He is very well-educated, athletic and fit, love of nature and literature, good cooking, play tennis and or golf, fond of classical music and a concert goer in SF.

Having said that, I think meeting like-minded person and who is within a similar age range would be practical to develop a long term friendship for outdoorsy activities and reading and listening classical music.

I am attracted someone that is intellectual, smart, fit and athletic, enjoys at least one outdoor sport, and classy and into cultural activities such concerts and stimulating conversation.

To be practical, that someone special be within a similar age range, 48-56 y/o, and is currently single, of course.

I'm politically progressive, well-rounded person with a diverse interests in performing art and science.
I like someone that is a well-listener and patient, and has a professional career with a happy outlook in life. Are you with a lighter baggage that you have more time for romantic relationship?

The answer is yes, please respond with some introduction about yourself and recent photo.

Cheers.

I'm a moderately successful, intelligent-ass lady and want to ""expand my circle"" without any expectations of what's to come. A lady never reveals her age (right?) but I will say that I graduated college not more than 10 years ago.

Like others on here seem to mention, ""you probably wouldn't expect to find me posting on CL""...but hopefully it helps cut through the clutter to find other like-minded individuals.

Can you relate to working so much that it seems like you blinked and it's late February? OK, to be completely honest, life isn't entirely all work and no play, as there are hobbies and sports. However, human beings are wired to seek connections, and nothing replaces companionship, and not just friends and family, agree? While it certainly would be great to meet someone with long-term potential, I'd be happy to make a new friend with whom to share a nice dinner with good conversation. How does that sound?

I'm mainstream and practical in many ways, including being an educated professional with traditional family and relationship values, along with a deep appreciation for chivalry. At the same time, I'm very spiritual, and love connecting with others who similarly have a spiritual life and aren't too hung up on the trappings of the human experience. Beyond that, there's absolutely room to play, banter and have fun.

So, with all that said, if you think you might be interested in breaking bread together, why don't you introduce yourself with enough details to give me a sense of who you are and what you are looking for? Please be reasonably close in age to me, as well as in physical location. Also, you must be single and unattached. Including a picture or two is highly encouraged.

Whether or not we connect, here's to a great weekend!

Hello gentlemen, 

I am a 34 year old light skinned African American woman and I am interested in finding a good candidate for a serious long-term relationship. The man that I am looking for is seeking the same in a woman. 

I am not looking to jump into anything. I am looking to spend time getting to know a good man that understands how to treat a lady. Someone who is down to earth, family oriented and enjoys both staying in and going out. I am looking for someone with a good sense of humor that can make me laugh. I am looking for someone who is hardworking, responsible and kindhearted. 

A little bit about me : 

I am single, a smaller bbw, caramel complexion, long brown hair, kind hearted and down to earth. I enjoy a wide array of music, movies and activities. I am hardworking, responsible and family oriented. As far as race is concerned, I date all races, colors and creeds. I do have a soft spot for white men, especially redheads... As for age, I prefer a man to be between the ages of 25-45 but I do understand that there are some younger men that are more mature and some more mature men that are young at heart. 

If you are interested in what you have read and would like to know more, please feel free to reply. Please reply with a picture and tell me a bit about yourself. Your picture for my picture.

Hi CL,
I'm a curvy, white, attractive, female looking to meet someone special or just even some single friends in my area. I am NOT interested in a one-night stand or meeting a married man.
My biggest problem, and I'm telling you this because I'd love to meet someone who doesn't consider it a problem, is that I'm very introverted. I'll talk your ear off once I get to know you, but I'm quiet around new people and am uncomfortable being the center of attention in large social groups.
I love outdoor activites: going to the beach, skiing, hiking, kayaking. I also enjoy movies, art, music, bowling (even though I'm terrible), and trying new restaurants.

. . .just one man who is age-appropriate (60-75), close in geography (I live mid-peninsula), and similarly inclined (read on).

Neither of us is currently partnered, and we crave the steadfast companionship and deep intimacy we have experienced and expressed in past monogamous relationships. Living long has made us far wiser than we were in our youth. We acknowledge our imperfections and recognize that understanding, compassion, affection, and acceptance are essential to a lasting relationship.

We are both intelligent, articulate people, active and involved, socially and politically liberal, and financially stable. We're still healthy, energetic, and attractive, and we intend to keep ourselves that way for many years to come.

Here are some specifics about me:

I am HWP (5'4"" tall, ~137 lbs.) and Caucasian. Raised east-coast Jewish, for the past two decades I have been an active member of a progressive religious community that includes people of all persuasions. I am omnivorous, and get along best with those similarly inclined. Semi-retired now, I continue to seek ways to contribute my experience and energy to people and projects that make a difference in the world. Among the pastimes I enjoy are music and dancing, puzzles, cooking and savoring good food and beverage, hiking and exploring (especially with my canine companion), flowers and plants, computers and the Internet, movies and some TV, home maintenance and renovation. My social and political leanings are decidedly liberal/progressive.

I just watched an episode of House Hunters. A guy named Jeff with a best friend name Susy we're checking out vacation homes in Lake Tahoe. The whole time I'm watching this episode I'm thinking what a handsome guy. He's 6 foot four, 47 years old, and single. There was something about him that intrigued me.

Simple girl looking for regular guy to meet up for drinks/dinner tonight or perhaps sometime this weekend. Recently got out of a thing and would like to get out and do something rather than just hang out at home. I don't have any real expectations that this will work but hey it's worth a shot.. and well work is a drag at this exact moment.

I am 31, in SF, 5'8 brown hair, fun, smart all that jazz. I went to college, have a job and pay taxes.. I'm totally not some gold digger creeper like this place seems filled with. 

If that sound interesting to you, email me. Tell me your age, location and send a PG photo. Ill reply back if it seems like a fit. As I am in the city and would likely want to meet downtown where there are more options. Soma or Tenderloin are cool too. I prefer casual type bars but can feel comfortable most places. 

Also I am real as all real can be. Don't ask me if I am a hooker or send me a picture of your penis. It is a waste of time. Mmmk, thanks! ;)

I didnt know how much i was going to miss you when i was preparing myself for what was to come. 
I didnt even stop to consider my future without you because i always knew i was taken care of as long your around, and i would stop thinking about it because it hurt too much to go there. I didnt consider all the wonderful luxuries you made possible for me to enjoy and i didnt get to thank you properly i feel. 
Thank you for providing the best car i have ever had the priveledge of driving. Thank you for welcoming me into your life and making me feel wanted and the most important part of our home. For thinking enough of me to stand against everyone who had anything to say about our relationship. For being my best friend and taking my secrets to oakhill with you. For everything i didnt have to ask you for, you gave it to me because you knew i needed it. Thank you for making me feel and look beautiful it gave me confidence i never knew before. 
I just wanted you to know somehow that i wish i could turn back time and do ours over again because i would more amazing for you and make you so happy that your heart would last until after i left. 
My life without you is awful. You spoiled me and its hard to get used to not haveing love, or a vehicle or that welcome wanted feeling. I dont even have money for basic ammenities or food most of the time. I feel like an ugly scuzz who gets beat up by an abusive boyfriend like you see on tv. You made it possible for me to look desirable and established. Now i have nothing. Why cant you come back and take me out of this cold hell im in and ttake me back home and have all kinds of sex for years from now? And let me go shopping for christs sake, im better than this!

Love food (any kind, doesn't have to be fancy, just tasty). Love films, especially foreign and independent ones. Frequent museums and theatre.

A light at the end of the tunnel....I see it getting closer!! I'll be entering a new phase of my life. My kids are mostly grown and will be out on their own chasing their own dreams in less than 5 years. I'm seeking to meet a great guy that is within 5 years of my age and 30 miles of Novato. Logistics prevail if I want to get to know someone. (RECENT UPDATE: Before responding to this post please read all the way through to the end)

Although I'm independent I'd like to find a great partner to enjoy this next phase of life with. Perhaps one that has raised his own kids. I'm looking for an established man that has led an interesting life and has good stories to tell. I also have good stories to tell. 

I'm financially stable and seek to find my equal or better with regards to finances. I love the outdoors. Whereas I once used to like to rock climb, backpack and campout under the stars...my tastes for adventure have tamed over the years to easygoing hikes, bike rides, paddle a kayak and sleep in nice, comfortable accommodations. I still enjoy a good road tripping adventure and especially seek to explore more countries. Ask and I'll give you my bucket list. Nobody is flawless but if you have a good sense of humor, try to practice kindness and can use your resources to fix a problem then you're the guy I'd like to meet. 

I'm not in a hurry to ""jump in"" to a relationship but nor do I want to drag my feet. I consider making friends along the way a bonus. Honestly I'd like to have found a partner years ago but being a full time, single mom hasn't allowed much time for that. 

If any of this sounds good to you. Send me a photo and I'll do the same. Maybe it will go somewhere. Look forward to hearing from you. **RECENT UPDATE: To avoid spam (and those to busy to read to the end) please put your favorite place in the subject line. Thanks and wishing us both luck :)

I am seeking a man who wants to co-create a joyful and conscious relationship that celebrates life and facilitates growth, both as individuals and partners. 

About ME: 
- chronologically newly septuagenarian, but I look and feel 50-ish
- height 5'4"", weight 130s (HWP), pretty face 
- raised east-coast Jewish; now spiritually liberal / inclusive / progressive 
- enjoy wine, spirits, and the herb (all in moderation); intolerant of tobacco 
- own my home on the mid-peninsula 

About YOU: 
- age appropriate (~60-75) 
- somewhat taller and bigger than me, but still height-weight proportionate (HWP)
- geographically proximate (the closer the better....)

About US both: 
- legally and emotionally available (i.e., single/divorced/widowed and not currently partnered)
- seeking a best friend, lover, and partner...for the long term 
- educated / intelligent / articulate
- reasonably fit and in good health (no tobacco) 
- financially solvent / responsible
- active / lively / interested
- liberal / progressive -- socially, politically, spiritually 
- values-based, ethical lifestyle 
- kind, gentle, warm, affectionate, considerate, dependable

Although I appreciate and applaud ethnic and lifestyle diversity, I am looking to partner with someone who -- like me -- is Caucasian, heterosexual, and monogamous.

It's the guy who is well put together that appeals to me. It's the man who isn't trying to be the boy, the gentleman who knows when it's time to be subtle and time to take charge. One who values the building of trust over the catch and release. 

Here's a glimmer of my story; I'm not looking for the love of my life and you shouldn't be either. I am a bit old fashioned but not typical. I am loved but am lonely and one has nothing to do with the other. I am needing the secret that will feed my soul. I want to be friends with the one I am intimate with. I want someone attentive in the interim, can mix things up by having an occasional evening free, you're not too paranoid to meet in public. Someone who will feed the storm while being the quiet place to leave it behind. 

If you are the one who answers every posted ad, kindly don't respond to mine. I'm looking for a ruby in the mountain of rocks. The one who waits for the moment to step out of the shadows because he sees the chance to change the game. The one who knows that a whisper in the dark is as erotic as a touch to the skin. I ask for a man of patience, who recognizes the importance of courtship. 

Your photo needs to be accompanied by just the right words. My definition of a handsome face isn't always what society dictates. It's just a starting place. Make your impression wisely. The first ones do count. 

You are 45-60 years of age, and a tall man. You're stable and smart and for the most part kind. You understand that small talk is part of the seduction, that naughty chat is a lazy way to get there. You'll enjoy texting or online chatter rather than emails. You don't smoke. You're not looking for a super model any more than I am. You have standards, and recognize that I do too. 

Now let's see if you exist...

Hey,

I'm looking for a Catholic friend to go to church with on Sunday mornings (not to be confused with a ""friend with benefits""). So if you are only looking to date, this might not be the best option for you. 

I found a church I really enjoy that has great music, interesting homilies, and a vibrant community. If you have a favorite church, please let me know! I'm a very social person and am looking to meet someone that loves going to church, and wants to strengthen and uphold their relationship with God. 


Bonus points if you enjoy hiking and running as well.

A little bit about me: 
I go to church every Sunday and enjoy singing every song (even if I don't know all the words ;) !! I recently joined a bible study group and that has been awesome. I'm an optimist. In my free time I like to read books and exercise outdoors. 

If you are Catholic, please send me an email with the following:

-Why you'd like to be my ""church buddy""

I'm an energetic outgoing single good black woman that work hard and can hold my own and looking for the same in a good man. I believe life is what you make it and it's twice as nice with the right partner. I do think chemistry is of the utmost importance; however honesty, integrity and loyalty are keys to a great relationship. I like doing thing inside and outside, traveling, shopping comedy; music concerts working out and plays in addition to cooking and just about anything as long as I am not harmed and at times watching TV with that special one just doing whatever.
I have kissed a few frogs and I'm ready to kiss my last frog to get to my life partner.
I'm a youthful 50yrs old, 5'7 a little thick in the hips (however no complaints from the men thus far) LOl love to dress up and down in a part of jeans. Oh yes and please send a picture if you would like me to reply.

I look for Real Life with it's Real Challenge, Pain, Love, Disappointment, Trust. I'm REAL!
Below you'll read my thoughts about how a relationship between two sophisticated people, the seniors (!), should start.
This is deleted twice a day. I think it doesn't fit the education level of CL population, does it?

I strongly recommend those who look for just sex to pass me by.

Someone said that I'm ""edgy"". Actually, I'm NOT edgy nor hardened. I'm Transparent, Kind, Warm, but also Selective. And I know that To be Happy Means To Be Understood.
If you overcome a feeling of discomfort caused by the unusual directness of this text, I'll send you my REAL pretty poetic and philosophical, very long profile.

I'm NOT an American nor Asian woman but am a US citizen, who is ready to share my beliefs with you. 
And here it goes.
. 
Before jumping in the man's arms, a smart woman who respects herself, knows who she is and who she looks for, has to see a potential partner in different life situations.

It's NOT about a trip to a restaurant followed by a hookup! NO!

Actually, there isn't too much to find out at 60+ , as the main part of our journey has already been finalized: we've got education, built our careers, raised the children and made a certain number of mistakes which we would like to avoid repeating.
Yes, too often we betrayed our inner being for different reasons, and this time we have no right to lie to ourselves.
It seems to me that what a decent and honest woman, looking for a partner for a final chapter of her life, needs to think of is: 

1) how this man relates to her in terms of her views and beliefs ( I have a high spirit, believe in education, am opposite to feminists but can't be told what to do by anybody. I greet the wind in the face!), her attitude to politics (I'm active and passionate about what I believe in. In short, I'm an activist), the work she does ( I'm going to never retire as I love my profession and can always work part time, while having an opportunity to choose when and how much to work, and this is my way of expressing myself in life);
2) how compatible their characters are. (I'm peaceful, friendly, dignified, not materialistic and not diplomatic-just desperately sincere and unable to stand insincere, indecisive and fearful beings.) I can't be ""controlled"" by the man as I'm absolutely committed by nature. I will ask for advice myself but won't stand constant ""corrections"". To put it in a nutshell, I'm Not a Follower and Not a Leader. I can only walk by the side of my equal. An ""alpha male"" isn't my match for sure.
3) if they are compatible sexually. By this age, too many men have lost their potency while women, after having given all they should to the children and families, are still up to experiencing the richness of love life with the Man they Can Respect.

Right, it's Very Hard to Meet Such Men on Dating Sites. 

We love with our soul and body, don't we? I'm passionate and intense if in love (You know that Love Is Demanding, right?), and I want to be on fire, while not every man wants and is capable of giving himself to the relationship fully. 

I'm a devoted and reliable friend, and I need to feel the reciprocation of the same level; otherwise, my feminine pride will push me to leaving. 

4) The eyes are a mirror of the soul. So, the eyes are more important than anything else. Mine are big thinking and smiling eyes, and you can read a lot in them as I'll look Directly into your Soul. 
Appearance of a potential partner is important not only to men but also to women. But men don't need to be ""cute""; they need to be Handsome and Manly. 

People say I'm an attractive and elegant lady.

5) the attitude to money and income is usually a deal breaker. None of us is eager to partner a loser or user. In my pretty traditional view, it is normal if a man earns more and acts like a gentleman in any circumstances. On the other hand, to be an independent woman doesn't only mean to be able to support herself, it means to resolve her problems on her own, which I'm used to do successfully. 

In general, interacting of a potential couple with an outside world (not just the super-limited world of their shared bed) can either make them closer or tell them that they are not compatible at all.

People need to feel a click at different levels, and the INTIMACY includes so much! It may start during the hike people go on together, during volunteering, at the concert hall, where they both are thrilled by the performance of an orchestra, when doing charity, promoting business and sometimes helping each other. But accepting help or gifts requires the reciprocation, which a woman at the stage of OBSERVING usually is not ready for. 

I'm deadly tired of both pushing away the jerks from dating sites and of talking with much older men, who want to warn me that my search for True Love with a True Man while having my Very Thick Filters on, is severe and devastating for myself.

I'll try!

I think that, in case I decide to be close to a man, I won't want to move to his place right away. At this age people have completed so many tasks ( study, child rearing, career), that, if they want, like I do, to have a Very Close Relationship with a Like-Minded partner, it's better to really focus on how they feel their togetherness and how they feel interacting with a world as a couple before making a serious decision. They need to stay in their familiar environment, do their jobs...
You remember that I have even a longer text to share with you, right? I bet, you'll impression will be just opposite to the one you've got from reading the text in here...
Your Serious introduction with an image is welcome!

Smile!

I remember a proverb ""Hope dies last"". Do you?

Greetings.
I'll try to stay positive although it's not so easy after reading some ""calls"" of men and women for ""having fun"". 
English isn't my native language. Although I'm fluent, I believe there is something in my Tone that is hard to appreciate and understand to Americans.
I've decided to re-phrase some American woman's profile and tell about Myself this way.
See what I've got.
""Hazel-eyed, intellectually insightful, aesthetically inclined, sensitive, spiritually attuned, nature grounded. I like words!
Interested in co-creation of a new chapter of LIF with wit and laughter, depth and daring. Appreciating challenging stimulations combined with peaceful calm. 
Youthful in body and mind, energetic and engaged with the world, 
valuing kindness, integrity, creativity, especially humility, humor, wisdom.

In early 60's, attractive, active, artistic, aware, mature and childlike.

Seeking LOVE - to love and be loved, for the rest of our lives, 
starting with mind commonalities, and kind, great heart, then body, spirit pervading all. ""
So, that woman and I look alike indeed, at least because we Like Words, Depth of the Spirit and Arts. Also, at 60+ we can act very young.
We are also alike in Not Getting Responses from Quality Men. That woman and I WANT you to TELL about yourself, your interests, BELIEFS, pursuits, circumstances. 
Unlike too many prostitute-like ""sirens"", we, NORMAL ladies, look for a KINDRED SPIRIT. All the rest comes next!

I'm loving, confident, loyal, fun, and know how to handle my life and my time so I make time for you - be similar. I keep my house, myself, and my life clean and in order.

I've been listening to Vince staples, nosja thing, e40, Josephine baker and others. I have tattoos. I'm pale. I like to smile and compliment strangers. I use to play video games. Stanley parable, unfinished swan and journey being my favorites. I eat with a verocity. I dream. I smoke spliffs. I don't like pills or anything else. Don't even drink or smoke cigs. 

What I'm looking for: not something serious. Just looking to meet amazing people. Make new friends, share my love, my knowledge and create things with others. Let's make music.

Looking for a connection, maybe prince charming, maybe you...

While I'm not sure that craigslist is the best place to meet people, I'm figuring the odds couldn't be worse than the dating sites. You're far more likely to be here, casually perusing CL out of curiosity, than at a bar or on a dating website.

I am smart, independent, accomplished, confident. Don't take myself or life too seriously. Generally will try anything once and have a great sense of adventure. I am a college educated white collar professional who works hard to keep her work/life balance. I have a sense of humor, sometimes witty and often smiling.

You are someone who can appreciate all that I have to offer and offer much of the same. You are charming, a gentleman, confident and secure in who you are.

I love yoga and personal transformation. I am committed to intentional communication and cultivating skills for more pleasurable connection and authenticity.
I love to dance, and would be especially excited if you know how to lead East Coast Swing or Blues (or are interested in learning).
I am Jewish and NeoPagan. Same would be lovely, and open to complimentary paths (BuJew, Humanist, etc). The quality of being a mensch (a person of integrity and honor) is more attractive to me than someone who happened to be born Jewish.
I am passionate about living a life of quality and joy!
Big fan of Doctor Who.
I have been to Burning Man several times, feel mixed but generally inspired about the experience, and will probably go again.
I would love to soon live in an ecovillage.

You are a single man probably between 33 and 43 who resonates with what I'm saying and how I'm saying it. You enjoy and value geeking out about and implementing best practices for relationship, touch, and living well. You are monogamy minded and want kids. You're ready to find the right woman and cultivate visionary partnership.

If you choose to reply, please include some thoughtful message about how this resonates with you, your age, a bit about you, and whatever else seems relevant. Thanks!

5 months is a very long dry spell for me, but given the catastrophic level of heartbreak that occured, it was probably necessary. I'm mostly back to my giggling, flirtatious self. Unfortunately, efforts to find a suitable tall drink of water have been mostly fruitless with the exception of a few rainy night fumblings in a car with a hot chef. Fun yet frustratingly adolescent, and leaving me feeling no less virginal.

People are so blase about casual sex these days, but I need to be treated differently. More respect and patience is required to score with me. So the months of lonely nights continue. My 39th birthday is in about a month and my sole wish is to be sexually active again.

The first problem is geographic. I live/work/play in San Francisco and can't host due to my squished housing crisis situation. So a man must provide four walls and a bed within lyft distance of downtown San Francisco. And not just for a one night stand.

I'm also in need of a sexually attractive man roughly 28-48 who is single, intelligent, and with good manners. Mad seduction skills. I know, who do I think I am, asking for so much. Right? I should just settle for a drunken poke in an alley with the first guy who offers, but I just can't. I need quality.

If this sounds like the job for you, please write to me with photos. Please. Don't write to me with no photos.

I'm a very curvy, fat, full figured and shapely plus sized woman. Very fair skin, long dark hair, pretty face, killer style, youthful, ultra feminine. If I sound like your general type, you will be pleased. I'm also very experienced in matters of the heart and sex, while still somehow maintaining an air of innocence, vulnerability, even naivete.

I'm not sure how I will ever fall into bed with a man again. My guard is so up, I'm feeling so protective of myself, and not very patient with men. It will take a special level of skill to solve this problem. Help!

I'd recently started a new employment in the north beach area (near the square)... Most days it's busy to the point where I just work through lunch and grab a protein bar to go. I'd love to be able to make a new friend who works/lives in the area who can convince me to actually take my lunch break and chill.

I am most attracted to military type, tall (at least a few inches taller than myself), dark or light (white, black, Latino, etc) men who appreciate a thick Asian woman. 

I am in my early 30s , Asian with very short hair, a lil under 5'6"" thereabouts, very thick n curvy. Educated, good balance between being mature and responsible and silly. Love to smile and make others laugh.

I would prefer to meet people a few years older than myself. Current or former military a plus. If you're into swimming, learning about other cultures and languages or bike riding (motorcycle) that's a plus. No drugs or smoking/420.

I do have a somewhat sarcastic humor but am usually pretty shy when I first get to know someone.

Please tell me a bit about yourself and send a (recent, no older than 3 months) clear face pic if interested. I will return same should it seem like it would work out. 1-2 liners will not get a response. 


PS: Am just looking for an activity buddy at first but open to more if the chemistry is there.

PPS: please know the difference between your and you're...and know when to use which!

ADDED: I may have given the wrong impression... But when I say lunch, I mean an actual meal... 😛

I really enjoy having my breasts suckled and would like to find a man interested in exploring an ANR.
This would be about building intimacy, exploring sexually and could evolve into a long term relationship. I am not interested in any kind of mother/son role play, it's more about the act of nurturing and the erotic nature of having my breasts stimulated in this way and creating a close, intimate physical/emotional bond. If it turns sexual, which is likely and in my interest, I prefer both of us be monogamous. 

I'm looking for someone very close to me in San Rafael who has a flexible schedule. I am not currently lactating, but would be interested in inducing lactation if that seemed right. 

I'm in my mid-30's, never married, no children, I live alone and am completely single. I am fairly short and curvy. My breasts are DD's, all natural and very amazing. I am happy to share more details with you after receiving your sincere interest. 

I'm not looking for casual sex or to hook up. I will want to talk on the phone, meet in person in public (maybe a few times) and get to know each other. I know it's a long shot, but maybe the right person in out there.

Hi I am looking for A man who is looking for love - not sex, not a pen pal, not MARRIAGE
A man who gets give and take and also gets that there is not a lot of changing going to happen at this stage of the game on either side.
A man who knows how to satisfy a woman: PERIOD. NO EXCUSES. If this is not in the picture, then I will definitely be open to friendship-basis relationship - but the future is uncertain. I will keep looking. 
Postpone the discussion of ""exclusive"" for 3-6 months, but at the six month mark, if the man doesn't bring it up, I am gone. GONE - I am not pressing a guy into anything ever - I don't have it in me. And I won't be bringing it up either - there is no point.

Hello, I go through ads on Craigslist and other personals, dating sites and apps, etc. Not unlike myself, I notice a lot of men simply looking to connect with someone. To talk to, to relate with on whatever you're going through and in that same regard there are those seeking to care for someone who needs companionship. I've met some of the best men this way, and have found myself looking forward to leaving work and going straight home to chat online with him. Technology has been kind in helping make the experience even more fulfilling. We all need something, but other needs can interrupt the happiness and satisfaction connecting with a perfect stranger can bring us. Let me get to my point. I'm a single parent of a one year old child. I barely have an income, and when I say barely I mean less than 750$ per month sometimes. I'm doing my best in being a devoted mother to my son and to keep my morals in tact which is probably something I wouldn't have done in the past had I been having these kinds of money problems in the past. So I'd like to try something new. I'm not opposed to meeting in person but the idea in my head is more like connecting with a man who is looking for a friend, someone to flirt with, dream about, hang out on our web cams together and allow yourself to be 100% comfortable with being you and not fear being vulnerability because I'll be right there doing the same with you and just help each other.

If you're a man who wants to go there with ne and has the means to help my tiny family with whatever you feel, I wanna give you my time and a part of my heart as gratitude for at least offering me some peace of mind. I want someone to make me feel like its gonna be ok and I wanna do the same for them. 

Email me something about you and let's take it from there. Ill exchange pictures via email as well.

It's been lonely living alone all these years. It feels even lonelier when I face leaving the expensive Bay Area when I retire in five years, moving far away, all alone, leaving my friends and life here. Therefore, I seek a man, within 8 years of age 60, living no more than one hour from San Mateo, CA, where after 1-2 years of dating, we move in together, agreeing on retirement options. However, years ago, I made an oath I'd rather be lonely than in a bad relationship, having been alone now for almost eight years, the longest I've ever been alone. 

I simply seek a happy enough relationship which involves we enjoy each other's social and erotic company and don't argue over money. Socially I enjoy: city culture, (live concerts/especially jazz vocals, ballet, museums and movies) outdoor beauty, (nature strolls, easy cycling/kayaking and hot springs) and emotional stability/maturity with honest integrity to offer genuine friendship. Although I am no longer idealistic as I was in my youth, having embraced life's ironies at age 60, my youthful hippy liberal values still persevere. Erotically, I am the slow sensual type, bordering on tantra, open to minor kink and need total monogamy. I'm usually drawn to guys who keep themselves relatively in shape, I making it the gym 2-3/week and doing some yoga. Financially, I only earn $70,000, but have no debt and significantly save. I don't eat out much, preferring to spend my expendable income on concerts. I eat simply, mostly soups, salads and stir fries, eating mostly vegetables with meat to flavor. Although I'm healthy, taking no meds, I have some minor ankle arthritis and am a carrier of HVS 2. As I rent, I'll certainly have to move when I retire. At this point, I'm considering buying a small home in Eugene, Oregon, a small college town with culture, but open to other areas.

If interested, kindly reply, describing yourself, as much as I have described myself in this post.

I'm going to be honest. An open relationship with a wonderful man is my perfect ideal relationship.

I want someone I can be friends with. We have to have some things in common. I'm a bit of a nerd, I watch sci-fi shows. I love classical literature. I love music, going out dancing. I drink socially. I love to get prettied up and going out so I would love to be with someone who wants to do that with me. I like the beach, hiking, picnics, going on long drives. I love travelling anywhere fun, especially if I have never been there.

I'm sort of expecting some creeper replies to this, lol. I'm not just looking for sex. But along with any sexual relationship I am looking for a friend. And also someone who is interested in exploring other relationships, while still staying true to ours. I know this is sort of a gray area, but really what is comes down to is I want to connect with someone that I am also physically attracted to. I am tired of being with people who deal with jealousy because I even look at another guy. There are tons of wonderful and beautiful people in the world. For me, sex isn't something that should just happen between you and one other person. It's an experience that is different with different people, and it's fun to explore.

All that being said, I do long for one person to share it with. Someone to come home to. Someone who I know is always there for me. 

If you are a man, around 30 years old, and feel the same way, feel free to drop me an email. :)

Originally from Europe. I live now for many years here in the USA, and like it very much! So how can I describe myself? First, I am real, do not play games (so I love scrabble besides other games), am centered, funny and can be goofy at times, choose to see life from a positive view, have a zest for life and love it! Love the outdoors, am ecologically very aware, more on the liberal side.
I am a very friendly, passionate and romantic, calm, warm hearted, caring, intelligent, very educated, open minded, energetic, very active and creative. 

Am more softspoken, sensitive yet strong, and seek my partner, best friend and soulmate. Some of the qualities I seek in my partner are kindness, compassion, is passionate, sensual, very affectionate and romantic. ""walks his talk', knows what he wants, can communicate his feelings and also has some form of spiritual practice.

I have many interests, some of them are: reading, literature, arts, music, going to bookstores where I can get lost at times, creative projects, cooking, theater, writing, and much more. I dont like to be around angry or negative people, dislike drama, life is too short for that. I see the glass half full, like to focus on the good in life by choice. I am interested in spirituality, consciousness studies, mysticism, philosophy, environmental issues, Ayurvedic medicine, mediation, yoga, tantra (tantric spirituality and philosophy, and yes its more than just sex!), and am learning more about it. 

When you write back to me let me know how to get in contact with you (by email), am sincere in my search and a picture is greatly appreciated! I am looking forward to hear back from you, and the best of luck on your search

I live in E'Ville and work in the City. Do the car pool. So, not so much stress.
I live alone but spend time with friends going out to dinners, cultural activities, cal performances, and often go to the city, both for trying new places, theater, museums, festivals, exhibitions etc.
I'm 49, stand at 5'6"", medium built, some say cute ;) 
I am looking for a highly educated gent (a Phd, a medical doctor, attorney, MBA, someone a serious professional, who is also interested in reading, traveling, museums, and have their own intellectual pursuits and interests). The reason I am looking for this kind of person is because, all my life I have only dated people who are smart and intellectually inclined.
That does not mean that we can't be little kids again, or we don't share mundane chores around the house, or cook bbq and enjoy cold beer.

Hope to hear back from you soon. I know its going to rain this weekend. Well, that is not a bad thing if we start writing to each other, or start texting :)
Have a nice evening!

If you're not aging (well, I guess we are all aging), you may not understand this comment.

sex or a so-called hook-up. (That's easy to find - - a phone call away)

I'm seeking companionship, friendship, affection, fun and yes, intimacy if there is a mutual

I don't know if i can find anyone on this service. I can only describe what i am like and what i am looking for, then hope for the best.


I am pretty special and people always remember my face, even if i don't remember theirs.
It's hard to describe why, but i am racially mixed, like to wear artful clothing and jewelry, 
have long hair (no, it's not white, it's still dark but for 2 white hairs). People say i am pretty, and look a little younger than my age. I am on the feminine side (not 100%).

Also, i am really fun, make you laugh a lot (i am trying my hand at stand up comEdy so you can be my audience, OK?), lovable, intelligent, educated


What i am looking for is love, trust, a relationship and friendship, hopefully, if that can be found here. Sadly, this site is so full of pornography that people seem to think that that is all it's about,and just send pictures of their genitals. Hey, don't send that to me. I am never going to answer you if you do. 

I want a genuine, loving, creative, local guy (within the bay area, not off in Fresno or Modesto or something like that....no good to make lots of global warming) who wants to have a real friend and hopefully real love. If you want to start really slowly and carefully that is good for me.


I am in very early 50s, and seek someone around 45--54 (not much out of this range please).
You must be non-smoker, no drugs or other vices (being a workaholic is a vice to me. I want someone with time to be together and have fun).

My preference is medium dark to dark skin, dark hair, not too tall and not fat. Sorry, i don't go for blonds or really light skin and eyes. I am on the small side and have some leftover pounds from being a mama, but it is disappearing with all the dance classes i go to. I like the gym as well and we can go together if you like. 

You still have your hair, or most of it, NOT bald or shaved head please ( yes, i have mine, and it's long, and growing).

I have a big preference for guys who love humor, smile, treat me really well, have a good relationship with their families and don't shy away from commitment.

Here is one important point: I don't like TV. If you really like it and watch it a lot this won't work out.
I don't even have one and don't plan on getting one. I am too busy, for one, but besides that, i can't stand commercials, and frankly, i don't like to sit and watch it. To me that is just wasting life itself.

I want someone who loves to dance (my likes are cumbia, samba, Mexican music, Zydeco at Ashkenaz is fun, reggae is OK) so we can enjoy that together.

KPFA 94.1 FM is on a lot at my place, and i participate in a lot of the marches and demonstrations announced there, so i want a progressive like myself, into progressive movements like Black Lives Matter (Brown Lives too), Living Wage, Stop Gentrification, Immigration Reform, and the like. 

A lot of my time goes to dance classes, and there is a summer college class i am starting pretty soon. I do have time on weekends and love to be together then. I love to go to street fairs, programs at Ashkenaz or La Pen~a or Mission Cultural Center, throw parties or dinners, weave (yes, i do this) and do other art-y things, try new places and things. 

I like to take photos and am trying to learn to make good video.
If you have similar interests maybe we should meet up. Please tell me about yourself and what your interests are, what you do for a living, where you live, if you have kids, etc. Please write enough so i will know if this is worth pursuing.

If you are vegetarian that is cool. I am not but don't eat any red meat, and usually avoid dairy too. I list4en to Mario Martinez on KPFA and he says that those who live to be 100 are Not vegetarians. . ..interesting. . ..but i don't eat red meat because It is not too healthy and it is not sustainable for our planet. . ...for the same reason, i don't want anyone far away. . .Global warming sucks, so let's avoid long drives OK?

I am single mom (only one kid, now a teenager) and the two of us live alone together. It would be nice to find a person that eventually will be my partner, so we can live together. I live Bay Area, not too far from San Francisco (i know, it is expensive). I am not too into the suburbs.

Please make sure you really want a friend/partner before you respond. I am pretty tired of these people who disappear after 3 or 5 emails or calls before we even meet. It makes me think they are married (if you are, or if you have a girlfriend or anything similar please DO NOT respond! Single guys only).

You have to be into long, deep conversations, good at listening and talking, value upfront verbal communication and being straightforward. I am very straightforward, and don't like silence or non verbal gestures that don't speak outright. We are not mind readers and should not have to be.

Please send me your photo when you reply, a good photo that shows your face clearly. I can send you mine if this looks like it has potential.

To me, we don't have to be with each other all the time, we don't have to watch the same movies, but we are one, but live in two bodies, but we are independent, ying to the yang. We are one and not at the same time.

Interested in dating. I'm not looking for anything serious nor a fling I'm open to love, it's just something that isn't planned. Chivalry, integrity and enjoying life are important to me. 

I have an ill mother that is more independent today than she was last year. I'm very thankful for that. In my free time you may find me at a festival, the beach or ????

I'm only interested in meeting men that are not legally married. I don't feel the best way to get to know a person is in text form. I like to meet people. Not interested in relationships cross continents etc. Please tell me a bit about yourself: location, age, interests, etc.

We will start by simply talking about the weather and our favorite sport team.
It only takes one man who is serious about getting to know each other. 

If you enjoy laughing, talking, cuddling, cooking, the SF Giants and intimacy, lets talk. 

I am 54 yrs old. Divorced, white female. I am 5'3, dark brown hair and eyes. I am a plus size-full figured woman with olive complexion, round hips and thick thighs. I have an outstanding personality. I am funny, loving, intelligent and accept people for who they are. I am in search of a long term, intimate relationship that will include adult nursing. I am not interested in a quick hook up. I am self sufficient and am not seeking someone to take care of me but rather, we take care of each other. 

My life is drama free and my home is warm and cozy. I love to cuddle on the couch while watching a movie or baseball/football, stroking your brow and running my fingers through your hair and kissing you softly. I do not smoke or use drugs and I drink socially and am disease free. 

I enjoy live music, festivals, SF Giants (how many days away?), SF Niners, card games, board games and the outdoors. I am a great cook and also enjoy baking. I am a big Walking Dead fan.

You: Between the ages of 45 and 58; NON SMOKER, NOT MARRIED, drug and disease free; are from either Sonoma or Marin County. You are intelligent and have a strong ability to communicate.

I am looking for someone who I can be comfortable with, have chemistry with, and enjoy spending my time with. I want to laugh at dumb TV shows together, enjoy taking a weekend trip, watching a movie, grocery shopping, and whatever other simple things we do.

I am looking for a fun sexy man who can make me laugh and sweep me off my feet. I am looking for someone who is drama free, honest, funny and mature while still playful. I am a large white BBW. Long brown hair and green eyes. 5'4 with 48DD and wear a size 28. I am a working single mom who is extremely loyal, drama free, and very family oriented. Once i am comfortable I am very sexual with the right partner and enjoy exploring each other.

I prefer Black men, someone close to my age 30-42, tall, handsome face, hopefully mobile or local. I have always had a thing for bad boys, and although I have grown up and not looking for the problems that come with that I would love to find someone with a bad boy look...tattoos are a huge plus. 

Basically I am ready to fall in love, head over heels with the right man who is ready for the same. I would love to get to know each other and see where it can lead! If you think you could be my Mr. Right then please get back to me with your age, location and a pic and we can take it from there. Hope to hear from you soon! xoxo

Accomplished, successful, very attractive Black female seeking a male for a serious, long-term, female-led relationship. For clarification, this is not for sexual fetishists or to fulfill someone's fantasy. Although I am a novice to this type of relationship, after much research and review, I have determined that it is the best fit for me. It represents the type of lifestyle that I would like to live with a like-minded individual. That is, I desire a man who receives his pleasure from providing me with love, romance, emotional support and also seeks the level of intimacy and connection that I seek. Basically, he is my best friend and is devoted to me. He is receptive to my leadership and guidance, aware that although he may have input into our decision-making process, the final decision rests with me. Although I expect that we will have a happy and healthy sex life, I would like my partner to be receptive to the possibility of cuckolding. Types of punishment for my partner will be determined jointly as will rewards for his loyalty in ensuring my overall happiness and contentment. I have no interest in BDSM types of punishment(i.e: caning, whipping, slapping, etc.) nor will I dehumanize or demoralize my partner. Ultimately, together we will develop a relationship that works the best for us. Other characteristics that I desire in my partner is that he be between the ages of 37-55, intelligent, educated, successful in his own right and financially stable. He must have an Alpha presentation in the ""outside"" world but be submissive to me in the home. I am also a sapiosexual-I am sexually stimulated by intellect. I believe in full-disclosure; therefore, it is important that any interested parties be aware that I have had HSV Type 2 for 15 years. Because I have behaved responsibly, I have infected no one. I am receptive to any questions or concerns you may have regarding my status.

For those of you who may find this type of relationship and/or my status objectionable or offensive, I ask that you refrain from sending me vulgar and disgusting responses. Just don't respond.

To the individual who has determined that my post required flagging, despite the multitude of dick pics and vulgar requests notorious for this website, I urge you to find another outlet for your frustration.

I love yoga and personal transformation. I am committed to intentional communication and cultivating skills for more pleasurable connection and authenticity.
I love to dance, and would be especially excited if you know how to lead East Coast Swing or Blues (or are interested in learning).
I am Jewish and NeoPagan. Same would be lovely, and open to complimentary paths (BuJew, Humanist, etc). The quality of being a mensch (a person of integrity and honor) is more attractive to me than someone who happened to be born Jewish.
I am passionate about living a life of quality and joy!
Big fan of Doctor Who.
I have been to Burning Man several times, feel mixed but generally inspired about the experience, and will probably go again.
I would love to soon live in an ecovillage.

You are a single man probably between 33 and 43 who resonates with what I'm saying and how I'm saying it. You enjoy and value geeking out about and implementing best practices for relationship, touch, and living well. You are monogamy minded and want kids. You're ready to find the right woman and cultivate visionary partnership.

If you choose to reply, please include some thoughtful message about how this resonates with you, your age, a bit about you, and whatever else seems relevant. Thanks!

Good luck in your search for Love!

About me. I'm 27. SF native. Teacher. Always cheers for my home teams. Loves the Giants and the Warriors, vanilla lattes and 90's hip-hop. I'm kinda a mix of Leslie Knope and Liz Lemon. I have Leslie's passion and love for what she does and Liz's sense of humor and cynicism.

So, I figure that even though this is craigslist- odds are that some normal people may be reading these, even if just for fun.😜
A bit about me. I've been described as more of a girl next door type. I prefer being outside instead of shopping or movies ( even though both are fun in moderation)
I go to the gym and eat well, and keep busy with good friends and family. I have young kids who I have more often then not- so whoever I add in my life needs to be more then ok with kids.
In a perfect world I'm looking to meet someone who will add to my life in all the best ways. Who will be one of my good friends and partner in crime (and I mean that figuratively not literally😏) have a strong physical attraction and that extra factor. I'm not looking for someone who is old enough to be my father-no offense- and I'm not interested in meeting for just a hook up, ( this is craigslist I'm sure you can find that if your looking) 
This is craigslist so my hopes aren't to high...If you've read this, and think you maybe fit what I'm looking for then write me back. We will never know if don't try it out. Please send a photo and I'll send one in return.

I'm an energetic outgoing single good black woman that work hard and can hold my own and looking for the same in a good man. I believe life is what you make it and it's twice as nice with the right partner. I do think chemistry is of the utmost importance; however honesty, integrity and loyalty are keys to a great relationship. I like doing thing inside and outside, traveling, shopping comedy; music concerts working out and plays in addition to cooking and just about anything as long as I am not harmed and at times watching TV with that special one just doing whatever.
I have kissed a few frogs and I'm ready to kiss my last frog to get to my life partner.
I'm a youthful 50yrs old, 5'7 a little thick in the hips (however no complaints from the men thus far) LOl love to dress up and down in a part of jeans. Oh yes and please send a picture if you would like me to reply.

- I like your calm, open demeanor and ability to talk with anyone about personal and non-personal & existential things with ease 

- I like that you are pleasing for me to look at, listen to, smell, taste and touch, and that these qualities are growing and becoming more rich as we share time together

- I like that we share other important people in our lives with each other

- I like that we explore new activities individually and together

- I like that you appreciate and want to have your own time, and treasure being close to me regardless

- I like your ability to be clear, communicate and openly talk about your feelings

- I like that you adore my daily compliments of you and your person, and that you strive to be more amazing each day

- I like how you receive my advances, and the comfort we share as we explore our romanticism 

- I love kissing you, any time, any place and for any reason. I love the discovery that our lips bring us

- I like the ways you show yourself to me, and how you show me what I mean to you

A light at the end of the tunnel....I see it getting closer!! I'll be entering a new phase of my life. My kids are mostly grown and will be out on their own chasing their own dreams in less than 5 years. I'm seeking to meet a great guy that is within 5 years of my age and 30 miles of Novato. Logistics prevail if I want to get to know someone. (RECENT UPDATE: Before responding to this post please read all the way through to the end)

Although I'm independent I'd like to find a great partner to enjoy this next phase of life with. Perhaps one that has raised his own kids. I'm looking for an established man that has led an interesting life and has good stories to tell. I also have good stories to tell. 

I'm financially stable and seek to find my equal or better with regards to finances. I love the outdoors. Whereas I once used to like to rock climb, backpack and campout under the stars...my tastes for adventure have tamed over the years to easygoing hikes, bike rides, paddle a kayak and sleep in nice, comfortable accommodations. I still enjoy a good road tripping adventure and especially seek to explore more countries. Ask and I'll give you my bucket list. Nobody is flawless but if you have a good sense of humor, try to practice kindness and can use your resources to fix a problem then you're the guy I'd like to meet. 

I'm not in a hurry to ""jump in"" to a relationship but nor do I want to drag my feet. I consider making friends along the way a bonus. Honestly I'd like to have found a partner years ago but being a full time, single mom hasn't allowed much time for that. 

If any of this sounds good to you. Send me a photo and I'll do the same. Maybe it will go somewhere. Look forward to hearing from you. **RECENT UPDATE: To avoid spam (and those to busy to read to the end) please put your favorite place in the subject line. Thanks and wishing us both luck :)

I am in my 50s. Fit, decent-looking, with a great job and grown-up children. Educated, well-read and well-traveled. I want to try and find the right man on craigslist, although not quite sure if this is the right place for that.
The man of my dreams should be single, educated, and most importantly - willing to find the right person as much as I do. I have some special requirements: when I say ""educated,"" I mean formally educated, with a college degree. I am very much attracted to smart people. Yes-yes, I know that a degree doesn't guarantee intelligence, so don't bother to tell me that. But it's Silicon Valley after all, and everyone is entitled to their idiosyncrasies. 
Wondering why I don't mention any other qualities, either mine or my dream man's? Because I personally don't trust all those ads describing how wonderful people are. You should find out for yourself what is in reality, not just on paper.

Hi I am near 60 and unable to work due to aches & pains but I can walk and get around pretty good otherwise. 
I am hoping to find someone like me. Maybe you are older than me (I hope ).
Maybe you are retired and live alone. 
Maybe you want someone who needs somebodies help, someone to spend your days with, someone to take a short walk with, shop with, see a movie with, go out to eat with. 
Someone like you!
It wouldn't matter to you that I don't have a job because I just can't work with this body that is beautiful but painful, or that I had a surgery last year and so now I am a transgendered person (yes I am all female)...and I look good... And I am kind of quiet & shy...and I also don't mind cooking! 
If I sound like someone you would like to talk to and maybe meet, REPLY TO THIS POSTING, and please send a picture so I can also send you one. 
Thanks!

Well hello there gentleman. Let's start this off by telling you I'm not here for a sugar daddy or baby daddy. Now that that's outta the way, I'm a single mother of 3 beautiful children that mean the world to me. Please understand they will always come first. If you don't like kids feel free to move on at this point. I've been single by choice for a bit now and decided I'm ready to change that. Between working and taking care of the kids I don't get out a whole lot so figured I'd try CL. I'm 35, brwn hair, blue eyes, 5'5"" with a thick build. If you don't like bigger girls that's cool just move on. I enjoy spending time with friends and family, reading a good book, cuddled up watching TV, swimming, bowling, fishing, camping, having a few drinks, dancing, bbq's, and more. I do have a few tats and piercings. Now I don't like liars or people that like they are sneaking so I'm gonna lay everything out cause I have nothing to hide. Yes sadly do to some situations ( nothing illegal or anything) I currently live with my folks, working to change that as soon as possible. Just letting that be known. As for what I'm looking for. I would like to find someone around my age 28-40, preferably someone in shape. I have a thing for a man with muscles, not a deal breaker if you don't. I'm interested in white or Hispanic. All in all I'm looking to make friends and see if it goes from there. If your still reading and any of this interests you shoot me a message. All emails must have pic or no reply!

Fit, fun, feisty (and flawed, too) professional gal ISO compatible companion for adventures in life, love, and learning. . ..really longing for love again.

About you. You're an active, smart, fit, present, patient, engaged and engaging non player in the 49-56 year old age range. You're 5'9+, well groomed, and know how to treat a woman. You are conversant, compassionate, kind, and healthy in body, mind and sprit. You've got a broad world view, a spirit of openness, and are eager to meet a decent woman. Ideally, one of your greatest virtues is patience.

Me? I'm a petite, blue eyed brunette with boundless energy, a ready smile, and an open heart. Often hear that I look good. Avid hiker who particularly enjoys many of life's simpler pleasures, among them daily exercise, healthy living, children, animals, laughter, the arts, good food, good conversation, lotsa lovemaking with the right one (very important), more laughter. I'm slightly alternative with a preference for the road less travelled. Strong connection to nature, so daily walking has been critical to my well being. I lead an active, sometimes colorful life, always guided by a strong moral compass. Traditional values, monogamy, kindness and integrity are at my core, and at yours as well. If we are compatible, we have a good time no matter what we do together. I'm not a fit with most and discerning about who I do spend time with. 
Still hopeful that you're out there. 
Are you?

If any of this resonates with you, I'd love to hear from you with a non generic reply (no pics please - still enjoy the element of surprise). Preference is to speak by phone fairly early on- we'll know rather quickly if we'd like to meet. As a traditionalist, prefer good old fashioned person to person contact vs. a text, phone or e-mail buddy. Thanks.

Peace

Hello, I am am 34 years old from the Southern IL/ Western Ky area. Fist let me start by saying that I am a BBW in transition. I am currently a size 16 but I am losing weight due to having the gastric bypass surgery. I'm at this weird place in my life where I feel like im too small for some and still too big for others. I have long dark auburn hair (but I do change it up sometimes) Grey/blue eyes (that sometimes look green) and I am 5ft6.

I am completely single. I have no children, and have never been married. What I want more than anything is to change all of that! I would love to find a SWM in the age range of 28-40(ish), located LOCALLY (within 30-40 minutes) from me. I am seeking a LTR ONLY, possibly leading to marriage some day (No, I'm not interested in ""hooking up"" with you). 

I love a good sense of humor and witty intelligence above all else. Honesty, integrity and compassion are all equally important. Good personal hygiene is a must! (Sad that I have to explicitly state that). You don't have to go to church, but a belief in God is important. No alcohol or drug dependencies!
I come from a good country family. I was born and raised country and I love it! While I like doing things such as ATV riding, bonfires and muddin, I also enjoy things like going to a concert, comedy shows, Broadway shows etc. I don't really listen to country music (I'm more of a classic rock girl) but I'm not going to tease you if you do. My family are avid hunters and fishermen, so if you're one of those people who are in favor of taking everyone's guns- keep walking!

Physically, I a normally find myself attracted to dark hair and eyes, tall men, (well maintained) beards are good. I do like tattoos as long as they are below the neck. HOWEVER, I want to love your soul not your face! The only real request I have is someone who is average to a little extra weight built. Since I am trying so hard to change my lifestyle and eating habits I need someone who can support me with that and not drag me down with theirs. 

I know this is a lot to read so if you have made it through pat yourself on the back! Like I said in my title maybe I'm looking for the impossible, but you never know what you'll find unless you put yourself out there. If I sound interesting to you, message me! I will gladly exchange pic for pic after you send me one *smiles*. Please do NOT send me nude pictures or ask for any from me. To prove to me that you have actually taken the time to read this, type ""I read it!"" in the title of your response please. This is my second attempt here and 99% of the emails started with ""So what are you looking for?"" I really hope you're out there, and you're looking for me too.

Enjoying outdoor activities, dancing or just a quiet evening watching television. Treating myself to at least one great vacation a year.

Hi, Your post was flagged before I could reply, so I hope you find this post because I'm attracted to what I've seen so far and I want to start a conversation. If it goes well, then I definitely want to ask you out on a date, maybe go see The Brothers Comatose or Nicki Bluhm at the Hotel Utah, or horse back riding along the coast off John Daly Blvd?

I used to think that, as an overweight woman, all I had to offer was my personality (which is pretty awesome sauce) but it turns out that I am also a sex object. Who knew? Now I can't wait to have a man use me for my brain.

I am probably most men's worst nightmare because I want a serious relationship. I don't need to walk down the aisle in a fluffy white dress, but I would like to get married at some point. I am not interested in having kids of my own, but if you have them, that is fine with me. So, I won't put any pressure on you to do these things NOW, but you have to see a commitment with someone in your future in order to get a response from me. 

I am a professional woman with a demanding career. I am ambitious and I take my work, but not myself, very seriously. I only work 40 hours a week, and I have many hobbies, so I am achieving some kind of work-life balance. I am looking for a partner who wants to make plans with me, but also wants to succeed in work and explore his interests. I will give you space, but it would be nice to know that you miss me sometimes.

If you are a mature and educated man, with a serious relationship in mind, I would love to hear from you. Sense of humor is really important to me, and I tend to be the funnier person in the relationship, but I would love for you to show me up. 

I have posted before but never seem to connect with anyone long-term. Follow through is important. I am a woman of action looking for a man of action.

I am happy with myself, and don't hate myself for my body, or what I look like
I am content knowing that I can love again, after divorce and after disappointment
I am not a drinker
I am not a smoker
I am a lover of champagne, once in awhile to set the mood
I have some good skills that you might find out someday
I am a lover of a clean well-shaved face on a man, no matter what his age
I am a lover of a mature silver fox, a man of sincerity, that might want love again


So, these are some of my am's, and I have am nots also. I have some arthritis (like many of you) which slows me down, I have a couple of other things that bug me (like many of you). I don't play beat the clock, or hike mountains, or bike long rides or walks. I am what I am and can do what I can do.

I am looking for a special guy, for whom I will be enough. I am earthy, and I am sweet if you treat me right and take the time to get to know me. Coffee is just the first step to many more.

I am here, I wait for that special guy to stick around awhile.
Players may not want to bother me or send me hate mails.

Seeking a single man for friendship and passion which (I hope) leads to a long term relationship.

You: Single, intelligent, literate, tall, honest, healthy, happy, drug/disease/addiction-free, mature, emotionally and otherwise stable.

Deal breakers: Married or attached, smoker, dishonest, Trump supporter!

I read a post today seeking a woman who wants to be ""war shipped""! I laughed, but it's also sad. I am only interested in an extremely intelligent man with whom I can have deep, meaningful conversations. And by the way, I'm decidedly not interested in a man in his 20s!

Yes, true. He told me that once. I found him at a bar in the Tenderloin a little before last call one night. He seemed to have had a few too many kamikaze shots and started over sharing with (lucky) me. Apparently the kid who he had been working with for the last few years is no longer a pussy and isn't afraid of the dark anymore. Furthermore, he said that the kid was starting to get into Dubstep which was driving him mad during homework time. I guess all this wasn't exclusively on a Monday, but the night I met him was. 

Right now, I am trying to hold on to that thought. While this Monday isn't back-flip-outstanding, at least I don't have to deal with dubstep from some snotty pubescent kid. Also at my work I have unlimited coffee, I bet that jerk kid didn't.. Well work isn't really that bad, I love my job, my mind is just very much somewhere else today.

Anyway if you are still reading, good for you! There is no boogie man pop quiz at the end but extra credit is always available. Among other things you may enjoy are some facts about me:

-For some reason the way pomegranates look creep me out
-Drink 1-2 cups of coffee per day
-I am tall and have nice teeth
-On my desk I have 3 plants, which aren't dead :)
-My favorite cereal is fruit loops.
-My bra size is D
-My passport has a few stamps, more to follow..
-I think I still no the Konami Code
-Early 30s but bartenders card me to be nice
-I have little faith this will actually work
-Sometimes I decarboxylate stuff


If you think you can match wits and you're a non creepy weirdo.. Send a note and tell me a little about yourself. If we email/chat and seem to click, I'd be happy to meet sometime for a drink. If we ever saw each other again, you can lie to your friends how we met ;)

Please be 33+ and in San Francisco. Today is leap day, don't ask me if I am a hooker or a robot. Now hooker-robtos, that's the wave of the future.

I have a great job I love, and my own home in San Jose (well, technically the bank still owns it lol). All I'm missing is a special man in my life. One who is ready to love and be loved. 

I'm 5'4, athletic (with a few pounds to lose lol), cute, affectionate, and have a GREAT sense of humor. I'm also 420 friendly. I'm a very sexual/sensual person who loves to kiss. I love to cuddle and caress my man all over ;)

I'm looking for a loyal man with integrity to share the rest of my life with. Someone who believes that communication is key to a succesful relationship.

I would prefer someone who is outgoing as opposed to a couch potato. Although I also enjoy staying at home cooking with my man or watching a movie cuddled up with him ;)

I am NOT looking for a one night stand or FWB. Your pic gets mine.

I am seeking a man who wants to co-create a joyful and conscious relationship that celebrates life and facilitates growth, both as individuals and partners. 

About ME: 
- chronologically newly septuagenarian, but I look and feel 50-ish
- height 5'4"", weight 130s (HWP), pretty face 
- raised east-coast Jewish; now spiritually liberal / inclusive / progressive 
- enjoy wine, spirits, and the herb (all in moderation); intolerant of tobacco 
- own my home on the mid-peninsula 

About YOU: 
- age appropriate (~60-75) 
- somewhat taller and bigger than me, but still height-weight proportionate (HWP)
- geographically proximate (the closer the better....)

About US both: 
- legally and emotionally available (i.e., single/divorced/widowed and not currently partnered)
- seeking a best friend, lover, and partner...for the long term 
- educated / intelligent / articulate
- reasonably fit and in good health (no tobacco) 
- financially solvent / responsible
- active / lively / interested
- liberal / progressive -- socially, politically, spiritually 
- values-based, ethical lifestyle 
- kind, gentle, warm, affectionate, considerate, dependable

Although I appreciate and applaud ethnic and lifestyle diversity, I am looking to partner with someone who -- like me -- is Caucasian, heterosexual, and monogamous.

If you resonate with this post, please write to tell me about yourself, including age, location, and current photo(s). I will happily respond in kind if we seem to be a match.

I'm looking for the real deal, a long term relationship that, hopefully, ends with marriage and family. 

A little about me before we move on to what I'm looking for in a man. I'm 25 years old, college educated, and a full-time healthcare professional and student. I'm tall, 5'6"" and not height-weight proportional. Yes that mean I'm overweight, and if you don't like it, move to the next ad. I'm shy and soft-spoken around new people, but once I open up, you find that I'm dedicated, faithful, family orientated, sarcastic, ambitious, and intelligent. I'm not a country girl, other than riding horses. I like traveling and boating, movies and music, concerts and art museums. I'm comfortable eating out before the opera or ballet, as much as I'm comfortable grilling and watching a movie at the house. Just look beyond my looks. Surely there is someone in this city that can do that. 

I've been told that I'm too picky when it comes to my men. I'm highly attracted to Asian men and successful white men. Latinos and Blacks are great as friends, but I'm just not that attracted to them. I'm also attracted to older men, so I'm looking for a guy between 28 and 38. I prefer guys that are taller than me, or men that don't mind if I'm taller than them. 

If you think you're up to the challenge, email me. Change the subject line to your favorite restaurant.

WILL KEEP POSTING, SORRY IF YOU DON'T LIKE MY RESPONSES!

Always looking at blue-eyed men. Blue eyes are my only fetish. Blue eyes get me hot and bothered. 
Some of the men don't however, they can play games and be cruel.

My eyes are brown, thus the super attraction to the blues.
Color of the sea.
Color of the sky.
Color of hope.

I want to stare into your blues while we kiss. I want to wake up to them. I want them smiling at me.

Maybe it can happen, I believe in miracles.

You: blue-eyed devil (more like an angel tho). Honest, kind, single, available, playful, not a NSA type of guy, not really into one nighters. I am really looking for a long-term guy here!

Available to meet, don't get upset in email and delete me. Don't be super sensitive and delete me. Is there hope of getting more than one email from a blue-eyed
guy?

You never know. Over 45 and under 65, some hair on head and no hair on face is my preference.

Send me a pic of your baby blues, no games please. I'll send you my pic and let's start staring and enjoying.

Happy last day of February! I thought I would try my CL luck one last time.

I am an never married, no kids lady that has her act together and is semi-retired much sooner than I thought I would be.:-) My main passion and hobby is acting. I have mainly done commercials and short films. I also have a part-time in home business. My thru thick and thin friends mean the world to me, and I am very blessed in so many ways. I have a deep faith in God and in love and am looking for my mate where it just flows and that has maturity.

Physically: I am olive complected, fit, 5'4, dark brown hair and eyes, and my smile and legs get the most complements.

So you are: Chivalrous, generous, fit ( please you don't have to be adonis..just fit), NO KIDS...no exceptions, are mature and know what you want. A pretty set age range is 46-56. I am 5'4"" so at least 5'7 would be ideal. Please also have your financial act together..no debt except maybe a house.

If you tell me a little about yourself along with your age, marital status (divorced and single only), where you live and a pic. I will respond in kind. I am not looking to start a sound byte conversation and am looking for a long term and respectful relationship.


Thanks for reading and have a beautiful day!

Obviously I am not looking for anyone here . Only those who read through and think you are a good fit should respond ,otherwise pls don't waste your time .

My husband has been been gone for over 2 years , I still miss him , but life has to move on . I have been looking for someone special for a while , haven't found him yet . Friends say I am a little picky --Well , I have to , since this person will be the one you will spend decades of years with , so he must be the one you feel comfortable to see , to feel , to touch , to stay with ,right ? 

I'm a well-educated person with 1 college , 2 university degrees (not in this country ) . Enjoy learning , focus on self-improvement all the time . For most of my career , I worked as a teacher & a manager . 

I am not lack of leadership , but I Do know when and where I should follow , especially on the dancing floor and in the bedroom LOL . I am a mature lady ,but have the silly girly-girl side in nature . I have intense passion for love and life , a people person , can fill in with many kinds of social settings . Can joke around , laugh at my own mistakes and learn from them . 

I enjoy the pleasure from simple things ,but choose not to sweat for the small stuff.

I am pretty a home body , like reading , cooking ... try to eat right and keep simple & healthy lifestyle ,never did smoking/drinking/drugs/gambling... nor date around or sleep around ...... I am not a person who falls in love easily,but once love , it would be 100%. As a strict one-man woman,I remain loyal to him . For the world , he may be just one person , but to me , he will be the whole world .

Like most Asian people , I live within my means and good enough to keep quality life with relatively low budget . 

Unlike most other women, I like books and electronics more than clothes and jewelry . 

I understand we come from different culture background , I have no problem with it and eager to learn more from you . (my deceased husband is Caucasian ). I have a son , a US military boy living in the army base .

The one I am looking for : close to my age , have good education ( bachelor degree at least ) and wonderful personality , ready for the committed relationship ; a home owner , emotionally and financially stable ; I am attracted to the clean-cut professional man .I also hope you are willing to make effort to communicate and good at it .

I am 47, glad to be told look younger than my age . I am a dress lady , have lots of nice dresses . Business casual is my style too . 

If you read down to this far and think you are a good fit , feel free to hit me up by telling some basic things about you: age, height , ethnicity ,education, career , family , kids ...with recent pics attached . I will be willing to answer any question you have for me . I am here eagerly waiting for you to walk towards me !

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, inwhich city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

About me: 

Very pretty SWF, size 4, a looker! 
Professional / advanced degrees 
Avid runner 
Yoga practitioner 
Love all things pink and purple 

My smile and eyes are my most prominent and attractive features 
I love the woods 
I love staying up late and seeing the dawn, lazy Sundays in bed with you 

I love to have fun and cut up with someone special - once a special relationship has been established 
Trying to teach myself Italian (slow process) 

A smart, quick thinking man is the ultimate turn-on for me 
I am delightful, delicious, demure, even dainty, subtle, sweet, sexy. 

The type of man I seek: 
I am seeking a successful, confident, and intelligent SWM, 56-72, who knows how to enjoy life. 
A man who will break his routine and try something new, or maybe try something new that he did not enjoy 7 years ago, 
like to learn a new language, a new dance, a new sport (i.e. - cross-country skiing). 

I am seeking a man who is looking for one woman to be his partner - a man who wants a longterm companion to engage in discovery with. 
Prefer a SWM who is well-educated (grad. degrees), sensitive and moved by nature, animals and the arts, a gentleman, kind to everyone 
(including waiters :-), 
successful in his chosen profession and he should still be excited about his professional work. 

Note - a man who dreads his work would not be a good match for me.

That's the best I can say of myself - and the aspect I value the most. There's other stuff of course - if you happen to care for multiple advances degrees, a fashion sense sharpened like wit to a razor's edge and a worldliness that stops just short of weariness. I'm also an enthusiastic swimmer and dancer, a capable chef and a writer of poetry (unpublished) and prose (selling slowly but still in print).

Among my favorite activities is simply observing human behavior which is why, ever since my time in Washington, I have had a certain affection for politics and politicians not shared by most people I know. I also find it virtually impossible to pass a child without stopping for some kind of interaction - eye contact at least if nothing else is possible. I'm up for just about any kind of adventure in which bodily harm is not implicit. Perhaps my next and most enduring one will be you.

I would like to have that butterflies in the stomach feeling.....

Would like to meet someone who knows to take the time to get to know someone, to share about themselves and generally be involved in the process it takes to go from stranger, to friend and more.

I'm looking for someone to spend time with. If you think you might be interested please email me back. I am 41, Indian, around 5' 5' tall. I am a big woman which means I am overweight.

I am a smart and pretty easy going person and I'm open to what I'm looking for....as long as we enjoy each others company and can carry on a conversation.

I am single and looking to meet interesting and new people. 

Please be between 38 - 44 years of age, educated (at least a bachelors), professionally employed,. Please be uncomplicated and easy going.

It would be really nice to be with someone who would enjoy a good conversation over coffee, a nice walk, an occasional dinner date, or just share a burrito.

Please no smokers, users, alcoholics, bad tempers, married men, one-night stands, friends with benefits.... Have been there done that.. .Not just what I want at this point of my life now.

First things first: I'm not looking for a hook-up or a FWB! If that's all you're looking for, please don't message me! I'm also not into hanging out for only a week, so I'm not interested in guys who are on vacation in the area. 

I'm Filipina (born and raised in the USA), cute, short (at just about 5'1"") and would consider myself a small BBW that carries herself well and I also have a great smile. I'm looking for someone to become friends with, with the possibility of a long term relationship, but I'm definitely not trying to rush anything. I really do want to find that special someone to share laughter and life with. I'm quirky, love sarcasm, can be quiet at times, but I'm outgoing and friendly, and know how to let loose and have fun. I have a good head on my shoulders, have manners, and know how to behave in public. I have no tolerance for liars, cheaters, or guys who are still in love with their ex. 

I'm attracted to white guys (that's pretty much all I'm attracted to, so it's very obvious to see who didn't actually read this) and it's important that you're single with no kids, non-ghetto, and non-cigarette smoking. I'm looking for someone in the age range of 27-37 and within a reasonable distance to central Contra Costa.

There's nothing better than spending time together with a man that's smart, creative, and a bit sexy. And one who enjoys going to farmer's market for fresh produce!

I'm 5'3, - and in shape, as I enjoy working out. I'm stable, sane, employed, and have my own home. I enjoy cultural outings, outdoor activities, and the genuine companionship of someone in a similar life situation whose interests match my own. I'm well read, politically astute, and enjoy a great conversation.

Now for the harder stuff: I'm looking to expand my social life and possibly meet someone special. A friend first that evolves and grows into something more. I think the best couples are friends as well as lovers.

I'm looking for a SWM professional (white collar) guy who is grounded, reliable, and introspective. Someone who is comfortable enough in his own skin to see the humor in life's ups and downs and can laugh at himself. Someone close to my age who lives nearby. I live in Concord (boring, I know!!)

I like to spend time hanging out in the City catching some lunch or checking out an art gallery and then a hike and out for drinks. Maybe swimming out here in the east bay, being lazy in the sun for a bit, and then going to a movie. Or maybe you teach me something totally out of my comfort zone.

I like fast cars and guys who enjoy speed. Not much beats taking a drive with the top down and the music up loud. I like going out dancing and there is something so sensual as being in the arms of a man on the dance floor.

I like people who enjoy taking a risk and going to new places and trying new items on the menu. You never know until you give it a try!

I also enjoy that connection to spirituality, whatever that means for each of us. I believe there is a greater power out there and that gives me a lot of satisfaction and peace. I'm a beginner when it comes to meditation but spending some quiet time going inward helps me deal with life's challenges.

I'm attracted to a confident man - one who is driven by the need to succeed - but who also has another side to him. A funny, silly side. And understands the work/life balance. And, who when teased, can laugh at himself a bit. 

If my posting interests you, please respond back with your information- age, hobbies and background, and a picture.

I am an attractive semi-retired professional who has several qualities and interests. I do not look my age and this I owe to my parents for their genes. I enjoy all sorts of music, sports and many other interests. I am real, enthusiastic with excellent sense of humor. 

One of the many passions I have is cooking. What makes it complete is enjoying a wonderful dinner, candlelight, wine with a great gent and maybe with a fireplace!

I would love to meet a mature, decent, honest, caring, witty, financial stable guy with integrity. Please be a happy person with passions, dreams and be healthy! If you are obsessed with working out at the gym and afraid to eat, I am not your lady! Just be a romantic with patience! I prefer men within the ages of 58 -- 74. 

What would be great is to have ""A Kiss At Midnight"" with my gent once you get to know him (not on first date)! I know this is dreaming but where would we be without dreams! 

I am not into texting to other States or countries so do not waste your time as I am only interested in dating someone in person.

I am very realistic and practical, not a drama queen. I love to be outside, I'm an avid hiker, I'm getting ready for a 10k race. I love being active and doing fun things. I have a lot of talents and hobbies but I won't bore you with the details yet haha. Currently still in college in the medical field. 

I'm looking for someone who is looking to start out as friends and if we click then maybe eventually a relationship. I'm not looking to hook up or a fwb. Looking for someone with goals, and has their shit together. My age range limit is probably around 20- 35. I'd like to meet someone who is looking for something similar. I may not find what I'm looking for but its worth a shot

Well I am getting older, but still young at heart. Usually I feel fairly cheerful when in good company, gardening, hiking, or playing music, but recently I have to stand up with Bernie Sanders and shout ""Enough is Enough!"" Yes, I am leftwing, organic, very grounded in the earth, scared to death by what is going on politically, environmentally, socially, economically. Still trying to fight the good fight and do the right thing and all that stuff, but it sure would be easier to do it with someone else. Do you like to garden? Time to plant and I need some help. And I'd share the vegetables and cook you something with them. It would be a gentle way to get to know someone, to see if there is a cooperative spirit, an appreciation of nature. A friendship? and maybe more. Maybe. That would be nice. I don't think its a fairytale that two people are supposed to grow old together helping each other down the pay, lightening each other's load, brightening each other's day. You should be somewhere between 58 AND 68, not be a smoker, and not drink much. Must like cats, be kind to children, have a good sense of humor, be able to be silly, but be very serious and solid in your core. An artistic or musical streak would be appreciated.

. . .just one man who is age-appropriate (60-75), close in geography (I live mid-peninsula), and similarly inclined (read on).

Neither of us is currently partnered, and we crave the steadfast companionship and deep intimacy we have experienced and expressed in past monogamous relationships. Living long has made us far wiser than we were in our youth. We acknowledge our imperfections and recognize that understanding, compassion, affection, and acceptance are essential to a lasting relationship.

We are both intelligent, articulate people, active and involved, socially and politically liberal, and financially stable. We're still healthy, energetic, and attractive, and we intend to keep ourselves that way for many years to come.

Here are some specifics about me:

I am HWP (5'4"" tall, ~137 lbs.) and Caucasian. Raised east-coast Jewish, for the past two decades I have been an active member of a progressive religious community that includes people of all persuasions. I am omnivorous, and get along best with those similarly inclined. Semi-retired now, I continue to seek ways to contribute my experience and energy to people and projects that make a difference in the world. Among the pastimes I enjoy are music and dancing, puzzles, cooking and savoring good food and beverage, hiking and exploring (especially with my canine companion), flowers and plants, computers and the Internet, movies and some TV, home maintenance and renovation. My social and political leanings are decidedly liberal/progressive.

If you resonate with this post, I hope you'll write to tell me about yourself (age and location are essential!), what you're looking for, why you're responding. When you do, please attach a current photo; I will happily reciprocate if we seem to be a match.

Looking to meet someone and make a good connection. Maybe meet up for a hot or cold drink sometime soon. Looking for someone in the San Rafael/surrounding areas. Looking for honesty, chivalry and someone who knows how to treat a girl right. Good conversation, some chemistry and see where things go. I am 44, on the heavy side but do participate in gym like activities. I love good wine, good food, cooking (omnivorous but make a lot of vegan/vegetarian meals), love the local farmer's markets and smooches. I am interested in a relationship, I enjoy being part of a team and like both shared and separate interests. I don't really do the make up thing and love PJ time at the end of the day.

Hi,

I would like to meet a cool companion for spring time outing to explore the Bay Area and cultural outing such as wine tasting in Napa or a round of golf or tennis or sailing.

He is very well-educated, athletic and fit, love of nature and literature, good cooking, play tennis and or golf, fond of classical music and a concert goer in SF.

Having said that, I think meeting like-minded person and who is within a similar age range would be practical to develop a long term friendship for outdoorsy activities and reading and listening classical music.

I am attracted someone that is intellectual, smart, fit and athletic, enjoys at least one outdoor sport, and classy and into cultural activities such concerts and stimulating conversation.

To be practical, that someone special be within a similar age range, 48-56 y/o, and is currently single, of course.

I'm politically progressive, well-rounded person with a diverse interests in performing art and science.
I like someone that is a well-listener and patient, and has a professional career with a happy outlook in life. Are you with a lighter baggage that you have more time for romantic relationship?

The answer is yes, please respond with some introduction about yourself and recent photo.

Cheers.
