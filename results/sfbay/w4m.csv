Hi,

I'm in town for the weekend and would like to meet someone new. I don't live to far away and I'm not afraid to make changes for the right person. 

I'm looking for my hard working ranching or horseback ridding man I can share a life with. 

I was born in the south east of the U.S. on a cattle farm. I'm short, athletic curvy, with a great figure and a great personality. I love to ride and work the land. I also enjoy the simple things in life, like curling up watching the stars.

I'm in my early thirties, please be around the same. I also prefer my man taller than me, so please be over 5'10 with average to athletic build. 

I am looking for long term. Please described yourself or include a pic, which will get mine.

Ready for a new relationship? Perfect time of the year for a new beginning with a special man. Looking for ridiculous chemistry..... Too much to ask? I don't think so!

Call it motivation? call it being shallow? Call it whatever you want...

I figured it would be pretty interesting to have a really hot gym buddy to go to 24 hr fitness with. It'll definitely get me to the gym more often hahaha I don't really need pointers on HOW to work out..just motivation to GET to the gym. haha Once I'm there, I know how to work out. =P

What do you get out of it...uh...not much to be honest. Maybe just inflating your ego? Maybe I'll buy you lunch if you are cool and not come conceited jerk....which will definitely make you unattractive after a day or two. 

Open to go to the 24 at Santa Teresa, Almaden, or Hillsdale. 
If you're far from here, don't waste time. I'm not driving far. 
If you're looking for a hook up, don't waste your time, just because you're hot doesn't mean I""ll jump your bones. 
If you want a free meal out of it..ok..maybe I'll be ok with that. lol 

A few times a week would be nice. LOL Hit me up if you're interested in this odd situation.

Hello, I am am 34 years old from the Southern IL/ Western Ky area. Fist let me start by saying that I am a BBW in transition. I am currently a size 16 but I am losing weight due to having the gastric bypass surgery. I'm at this weird place in my life where I feel like im too small for some and still too big for others. I have long dark auburn hair (but I do change it up sometimes) Grey/blue eyes (that sometimes look green) and I am 5ft6.

I am completely single. I have no children, and have never been married. What I want more than anything is to change all of that! I would love to find a SWM in the age range of 28-40(ish), located LOCALLY (within 30-40 minutes) from me. I am seeking a LTR ONLY, possibly leading to marriage some day (No, I'm not interested in ""hooking up"" with you). 

I love a good sense of humor and witty intelligence above all else. Honesty, integrity and compassion are all equally important. Good personal hygiene is a must! (Sad that I have to explicitly state that). You don't have to go to church, but a belief in God is important. No alcohol or drug dependencies!
I come from a good country family. I was born and raised country and I love it! While I like doing things such as ATV riding, bonfires and muddin, I also enjoy things like going to a concert, comedy shows, Broadway shows etc. I don't really listen to country music (I'm more of a classic rock girl) but I'm not going to tease you if you do. My family are avid hunters and fishermen, so if you're one of those people who are in favor of taking everyone's guns- keep walking!

Physically, I a normally find myself attracted to dark hair and eyes, tall men, (well maintained) beards are good. I do like tattoos as long as they are below the neck. HOWEVER, I want to love your soul not your face! The only real request I have is someone who is average to a little extra weight built. Since I am trying so hard to change my lifestyle and eating habits I need someone who can support me with that and not drag me down with theirs. 

I know this is a lot to read so if you have made it through pat yourself on the back! Like I said in my title maybe I'm looking for the impossible, but you never know what you'll find unless you put yourself out there. If I sound interesting to you, message me! I will gladly exchange pic for pic after you send me one *smiles*. Please do NOT send me nude pictures or ask for any from me. To prove to me that you have actually taken the time to read this, type ""I read it!"" in the title of your response please. This is my second attempt here and 99% of the emails started with ""So what are you looking for?"" I really hope you're out there, and you're looking for me too.

Like most things, there are pros and cons to dating. Sometimes it may seem like a necessary evil on the road to finding love (and it is), but that doesn't mean you don't sometimes want to throw your hands up in the air and say, ""forget it! I'd rather be single for life."" The planning, the getting your hopes up about a new guy, the being disappointed, the feeling like there are no decent guys left in the world, we've all been there. They do say you'll find the One when you stop looking, so maybe it's time we just put that little piece of dating wisdom to the test.

1. Guys who'd rather text forever than make solid plans. What is he waiting for? Does he need a hand written invitation in order to hang out with you in person? Even worse when you take a chance and ask him out, and he still can't seem to commit to anything.

2. When you find out he already has a girlfriend. But we had such a connection, what do you mean he's not single? Why would he flirt with me like that then?!

3. When your friend meets her soul mate after being on OKCupid for literally 24 hours. How is it that you could scour that site for weeks and barely scrape together a couple dates, and she finds the Chris Pratt in the online dating rough without even having a photo up?!

4. When he invites you out and then ""forgets"" his wallet. Look, we have no problem paying for our half, but when it's clear he had no intention of paying at all, we have to consider sneaking out through the bathroom window, and leaving him to wash dishes to pay off his debt.

5. When his idea of a date is bringing his entire entourage to meet you at a bar at midnight. A date shouldn't involve him making sure his wing man has a shot with one of your friends.

6. When you think it's going well and he freaks out because you left a spare tampon in his bathroom. Or worse, when he accuses you of leaving it there, but it was actually his roommate's girlfriend.

7. The third time you break up with the same person. Somehow it seemed more productive to revive an old relationship than find someone new. You were wrong. Twice. Dating is just too much work.

8. When you can't seem to get past the first date, ever. Even when it seems like the first date was fantastic, somehow planning the second date becomes harder than trying to schedule brunch with Beyonce.

9. The unsolicited dick pic. Once second you were innocently talking about the third season of House of Cards, and the next, there's a dick on your phone.

10. Watching your friend go through a bad breakup. If you start dating someone, there's a pretty good chance that crying mess on the couch eating an entire bag of Smart Food dipped in peanut butter will be you in the foreseeable future.

11. Coffee dates. Unless you're going on dates at 9am, caffeine is ill advised. No one wants to put any effort into first dates anymore, meaning you end up drinking way more lattes than you should be, and every date becomes pretty dull and repetitive.

12. When he looks nothing like his picture. The question is, do you call him on it, or do you force a polite smile, chug that latte, and get out of there asap?

13. When he leaves you with the bill because you didn't want to hook up. This guy doesn't even pretend he forgot his wallet. He just doesn't come back from the bathroom. So that's why he chose the corner booth with no view of the door.

14. Finding out he's a racist, homophobic, pro-life, misogynistic actual crazy person. It's official, there are no nice, normal guys left. You can end the search now.

15. When staying home in your pjs is more appealing than going out. You could go on another date with this guy, or that guy, but why bother? At least your cat doesn't have uncontrollable gas or make you watch UFC.

I want nothing more right now than to be at the beach with sand between my toes and a beer in my hand. I long for the company of an attractive and down to earth man. I've been having a rough week. I would really love to relax with someone today.

Perhaps we could get dinner afterwards. Or just start making out. I'm an artistic lady with intellectual sensibilities. I hope to find the same.

We don't need to be into ALL the same things. So long as we have good communication, can laugh together, and luv on each other, the rest will sort itself out. Lets eat out, take drives, and check out this amazing place we live.

I'd like to find a man nearly my same age and location to hang out with and eventually give it to me on the regular.

I'm attracted to smart, tall, average built, clean cut, employed, good looking white guys. Well, not ALL of them!

I like a guy who is assertive, not aggressive or pushy. I love a guy who cooks. I want a guy who takes charge and listens to what I say. 

I'm not into attached men, cig-smokers, lushes, or heavy drug use of any kind. I myself, partake daily (when I can) and enjoy craft beer moderately.

I feel nervous and awkward meeting new people like this,... it may come off bashful or dingy, depending where my head is.

I'm not one to sleep around. But I'm not trying to pin down the rest of our lives either. Someone wrote, ""light and lasting"", I liked that.

I look forward to finding and getting to know a guy that turns me on emotionally and physically; a guy who plans stuff for us to do and wants me something fierce!

Please be local and age appropriate (within 6 years seem reasonable). Please understand, if not included , I will assume ya ain't local or a good age for me. That, a few good words, and a handsome and recent picture of you, would be nice.

Good Evening Gentleman and Wishing You A Day!

So why am I posting on Craigslist of all places? Good question. I have found that CL serves as a one stop-shopping site. Why not?
So where does a woman my age meet a Romantic, Classy Respectable Gentleman? Can someone answer that for me?

Will I find what I am looking for on CL? Maybe. Maybe, Not. Nothing beats a failure but a try, so I am putting it out there. 


I am a black female 50-ish who age gracefully, so I don't look my age and I also have a youthful personality. My appearance is easy on the eye and I don't smoke or do drugs. For my age, I have a decent body type, but working out at 24 hour fitness daily to get in better shape. I enjoy life and if we communicate we can learn about each other.

Following is the type of guy that I seek:

YOU LIVE IN THAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA

1) Age range 50-70 (mature, settled, sane, preferably average to larger build)
2) A guy who doesn't mind a woman having a little extra padding
3) A guy who is comfortable with himself and doesn't care about trying to impress his fellow man by having the youngest, hottest arm candy. 
4) Someone who is looking to meet a Class Act Female friend for companionship.
5) No racial preference. I have dated outside of my race.
6) Enjoy going to concerts (jazz, blues, R&B and others)
7)

I'd recently started a new employment in the north beach area (near the square)... Most days it's busy to the point where I just work through lunch and grab a protein bar to go. I'd love to be able to make a new friend who works/lives in the area who can convince me to actually take my lunch break and chill.

I am most attracted to military type, tall (at least a few inches taller than myself), dark or light (white, black, Latino, etc) men who appreciate a thick Asian woman. 

I am in my early 30s , Asian with very short hair, a lil under 5'6"" thereabouts, very thick n curvy. Educated, good balance between being mature and responsible and silly. Love to smile and make others laugh.

I would prefer to meet people a few years older than myself. Current or former military a plus. If you're into swimming, learning about other cultures and languages or bike riding (motorcycle) that's a plus. No drugs or smoking/420.

I do have a somewhat sarcastic humor but am usually pretty shy when I first get to know someone.

Please tell me a bit about yourself and send a (recent, no older than 3 months) clear face pic if interested. I will return same should it seem like it would work out. 1-2 liners will not get a response.

I'm a woman. A rather excellent one, at that. Seeking a man. Again, a rather excellent one... For fun, frolic and good times.

And yeah - lots of kissing and stuff if we decide that's a road we want to go down (ha! ummm, pun not intended, but well, we're adults - however that is NOT the intention of this ad - but it's one of those things that I do love - and you should as well - and again, we're adults...and - oh God I'm stopping now).

Are you single? (Not married or separated)
In your mid 30s-40s. 
College educated professional. 
You have evolved on a personal level and know that having someone in your life to share true emotional and physical intimacy is a beautiful thing... and not something to fear. 
Compassion, honesty, kindness, presence, spirituality and love are core values. 
Handsome, take good care of yourself, active? 
Have a full head of hair? Urghh---sorry, I know how shallow that sounds. 

If you're like me, you're not interested in casual dating or fwb. You want someone to love, be your best friend and companion. At the same time, you believe a healthy relationship involves autonomy and maintaining ones individual identity. 

I've been told I'm attractive, but you can be the judge. 
I do yoga and meditate daily. I'm a vegetarian and try to eat healthy.
I'm shy at first, but then I warm up. I am a bit introverted and a free thinker who follows my own path. 
I prefer small social gatherings or quiet walks in nature over big noisy crowds. 
I have a bachelor's degree in tech. Work is not my life. 
I'm a loving and devoted person...but not smothering and I'm very independent. 
I'm not perfect - no one is. 

I have an attraction to men with thick dark hair, big dark eyes, milk chocolate skin and pillow soft lips. Indian, Middle Eastern.

I used to think that, as an overweight woman, all I had to offer was my personality (which is pretty awesome sauce) but it turns out that I am also a sex object. Who knew? Now I can't wait to have a man use me for my brain.

I am probably most men's worst nightmare because I want a serious relationship. I don't need to walk down the aisle in a fluffy white dress, but I would like to get married at some point. I am not interested in having kids of my own, but if you have them, that is fine with me. So, I won't put any pressure on you to do these things NOW, but you have to see a commitment with someone in your future in order to get a response from me. 

I am a professional woman with a demanding career. I am ambitious and I take my work, but not myself, very seriously. I only work 40 hours a week, and I have many hobbies, so I am achieving some kind of work-life balance. I am looking for a partner who wants to make plans with me, but also wants to succeed in work and explore his interests. I will give you space, but it would be nice to know that you miss me sometimes.

If you are a mature and educated man, with a serious relationship in mind, I would love to hear from you. Sense of humor is really important to me, and I tend to be the funnier person in the relationship, but I would love for you to show me up. 

I have posted before but never seem to connect with anyone long-term. Follow through is important. I am a woman of action looking for a man of action.

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, inwhich city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

I'm looking for a man who has led a life of wild adventure and come the to conclusion that intimacy is the greatest risk of all. To be known and to know another down to the very core carries possibilities of being hurt as well as of finding ecstasy that no other human activity can offer. Do you have the courage to walk to the brink and take the plunge?

I am an exotic - definitely not to everybody's taste. I love science because it tells us where we are in the universe and I worship art because it reminds us why we are here. In my professional life I practice a little of both. The bay area feels both familiar and strange to me. Familiar because it sports the liberal values with which I grew up and strange because I'm more used to intellectual pretensions than spiritual ones and don't quite know how to fend off the latter except by falling silent. I hate the mystical and love the pragmatic.

My basic philosophy about dating is that If you don't feel nervous about a first date there's no point in making it.

Photos help cut to the chase which is where I always want to go.

Maybe it can happen, I believe in miracles.

You: blue-eyed devil (more like an angel tho). Honest, kind, single, available, playful, not a NSA type of guy, not really into one nighters. I am really looking for a long-term guy here!

Available to meet, don't get upset in email and delete me. Don't be super sensitive and delete me. Is there hope of getting more than one email from a blue-eyed
guy?

You never know. Over 45 and under 65, some hair on head and no hair on face is my preference.

Send me a pic of your baby blues, no games please. I'll send you my pic and let's start staring and enjoying.

I would like to have that butterflies in the stomach feeling.....

Would like to meet someone who knows to take the time to get to know someone, to share about themselves and generally be involved in the process it takes to go from stranger, to friend and more.

I'm looking for someone to spend time with. If you think you might be interested please email me back. I am 41, Indian, around 5' 5' tall. I am a big woman which means I am overweight. I am looking for a man that can see beyond that to accept me for the great person that I am. I have a positive outlook and a lot of interests. I am a smart and pretty easy going person and I'm open to what I'm looking for....as long as we enjoy each others company and can carry on a conversation.

I am single and looking to meet interesting and new people. 

Please be between 38 - 44 years of age, educated (at least a bachelors), professionally employed,. Please be uncomplicated and easy going.

It would be really nice to be with someone who would enjoy a good conversation over coffee, a nice walk, an occasional dinner date, or just share a burrito.

Please no smokers, users, alcoholics, bad tempers, married men, one-night stands, friends with benefits.... Have been there done that.. .Not just what I want at this point of my life now.

I want to live, I want to give.
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
It's these expressions I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold,
And I'm getting old.

Neil Young's words capture how I feel about finding a man who -- like me -- has a heart of gold.

If you're the one I seek, you're a kind, compassionate, caring gentleman between the ages of 60 and 75 who lives close enough to me so we can play together frequently. I'm hoping you share these qualities that describe me: educated, intelligent, and articulate; energetic and engaged; a non-smoker (of tobacco) but appreciator of wine, spirits, and the herb (all in moderation); financially stable and socially progressive.

Physically, I am of average height and weight (5'4""/~138 lbs.), and considered pretty/attractive...but attraction is personal. While I appreciate lifestyle differences, I'm best matched with a man who -- like me -- is Caucasian, monogamous, and omnivorous. I am interested only in men who are legally and emotionally available -- i.e., single, divorced, or widowed, and not currently partnered.

If you would like to start a conversation, I hope you'll reply to tell me about yourself and why you think we might be a good match. Be sure to include your age and location, and attach a photo. I am happy to reciprocate if we seem well matched.

I'm a 36yo Filipina with too much free time on her hands. Well, aside from my job, and being caretaker for my dad.

I'm looking for someone to chat with, get to know, share a few interests with; if things click between us it may turn into something more; I'm open to the idea. If not, at least we've become friends. 

I have been told I'm upbeat, hilarious, kind and loyal. I'm a bit reserved at other times, probably because I like to stay neutral. As in I always like to see and understand both sides of the issues at hand. 

I look pretty average, although my ex swears that I look cute, especially around the eyes. I dress tomboyish (because it's comfortable), but can clean up nice depending on the occasion.

I like watching anime, Asian dramas, and comedies. My tastes in music are all over the place, though my current favorites are Kpop and 90s R&B. I do appreciate jazz, since I've played saxophone as a teen. I'm a bit of a foodie, so I like checking out different cuisines/restaurants as well as trying out different recipes. Yes, I can cook. I am a trained artist (and have the BFA to prove it).

So I guess this is the part where I mention what I want in a guy friend. The ideal one would be either Asian or white, hwp, fairly good looking, under 40, share some of the same interests, and at least have their act together. They would also be kind, caring, considerate, and positive.

So if you're interested please email me, and we'll see where this goes. And to prove you're real and not a bot, put your favorite fruit in the subject line. (Mine's lychee.)

Thanks for looking. :)

Accomplished, successful, very attractive Black female seeking a male for a serious, long-term, female-led relationship. For clarification, this is not for sexual fetishists or to fulfill someone's fantasy. Although I am a novice to this type of relationship, after much research and review, I have determined that it is the best fit for me. It represents the type of lifestyle that I would like to live with a like-minded individual. That is, I desire a man who receives his pleasure from providing me with love, romance, emotional support and also seeks the level of intimacy and connection that I seek. Basically, he is my best friend and is devoted to me. He is receptive to my leadership and guidance, aware that although he may have input into our decision-making process, the final decision rests with me. Although I expect that we will have a happy and healthy sex life, I would like my partner to be receptive to the possibility of cuckolding. Types of punishment for my partner will be determined jointly as will rewards for his loyalty in ensuring my overall happiness and contentment. I have no interest in BDSM types of punishment(i.e: caning, whipping, slapping, etc.) nor will I dehumanize or demoralize my partner. Ultimately, together we will develop a relationship that works the best for us. Other characteristics that I desire in my partner is that he be between the ages of 37-55, intelligent, educated, successful in his own right and financially stable. He must have an Alpha presentation in the ""outside"" world but be submissive to me in the home. I am also a sapiosexual-I am sexually stimulated by intellect. I believe in full-disclosure; therefore, it is important that any interested parties be aware that I have had HSV Type 2 for 15 years. Because I have behaved responsibly, I have infected no one. I am receptive to any questions or concerns you may have regarding my status.

For those of you who may find this type of relationship and/or my status objectionable or offensive, I ask that you refrain from sending me vulgar and disgusting responses. Just don't respond.

To the individual who has determined that my post required flagging, despite the multitude of dick pics and vulgar requests notorious for this website, I urge you to find another outlet for your frustration.

The carnist guilt and hate is thick, and their sense of right to censor through flagging reinforces my awareness that we truly do have a government that does represent the ACTUAL populace, they personally like to sensor -even in personal ads.

Single, hardworking, fun loving, practical but creative woman seeks the same in a man. Life is pretty full for me right now, except for in one aspect...that special someone to share things with...whether it be in recounting the days events when apart, or spending some meaningful time together. 

My interests can be varied from crafts to a little sci-fi, current events to the great outdoors. Honesty, humor, a sense . Of humbleness and compassion are values I admire. I also value a person's ability to work with their hands. 

I enjoy getting to know a person for who they are as opposed to what they look like. But I know we all have some preferences or curiosity. That said, for what it matters, I am just your average woman, a bit on the tall side, a bit on the softer side than I would like to be, but I am active. I have long dark hair, fair skin, long legs, and a big heart. 
I do find myself drawn to taller, and somewhat bigger men, my age or a bit older (late 30s to late 40s).

Hello everyone, I am a 26 Asian female. Recently graduated with my Bachelor degree, and been having a stable job for over two years. And now I am here for someone who wants something serious (LTR) but willing to take time to know each other at first. 
**If you would think I am not serious just because I am taking my time to filter down who I'd send my pics to, then you really dont need to spend much more time reading. But I can tell you, if you are serious you will not judge the other side of the monitor with a photo**

About you, I'd like someone 
1. Who is a mature, caring, and also has a stable job, willing to take initiative in a relationship. 
2. Open to accept other culture, as I am from China; though I have learned to accept and practice American culture, I still carry some of mine. Be patient with my not so good English
3. Age 25-35. 
4. Do NOT do any drug, or smoke. 
5. If you have a couple tattoo is fine, but know your skin is not a scratch paper. (oh also there werent your ex's name, or something like that. lol)
6. Caucasian is a plus, but I am open to any race. 
7. Open to share about your thoughts, minds, and belief. In another words, honest. 
8. Someone who I would share my free time (and willing to spend his time with me)
etc......

About me, recently get out of a relationship, which hasnt been sparking for a while, and the fact it was ""foggy"" for our future was what really pushed me away. I would not say I am cute or in good shape, which isnt being humble or crucial on myself, but honest. However, I am not ugly or SUPER overweight. To me, how someone looks is different accordingly. Someone may rate me way too fat, but someone may rate me just right. Some may say I am cute, some may say I am just a typical Asian. 

Anyways, as mentioned, everyone would have a different descriptions on the same person. If you want to figure out how you would want to describe me, and you found my post suits you.

I'm an energetic outgoing single good black woman that work hard and can hold my own and looking for the same in a good man. I believe life is what you make it and it's twice as nice with the right partner. I do think chemistry is of the utmost importance; however honesty, integrity and loyalty are keys to a great relationship. I like doing thing inside and outside, traveling, shopping comedy; music concerts working out and plays in addition to cooking and just about anything as long as I am not harmed and at times watching TV with that special one just doing whatever.
I have kissed a few frogs and I'm ready to kiss my last frog to get to my life partner.
I'm a youthful 50yrs old, 5'7 a little thick in the hips (however no complaints from the men thus far) LOl love to dress up and down in a part of jeans. Oh yes and please send a picture if you would like me to reply.

Thanks

Hello everyone out there. I am newish to the area. I grew up here but haven't live here for awhile now. I didn't keep in touch with many people who still live in the valley and am not making friends at work because I work as a sub on assignment and I haven't been in any one class long enough to get to know anyone there. 
I do have a very short list of friends including my best friend who lives with me along with her 2 daughters. I don't have kids but since we live together I do have kids at home and that complicates some stuff. And afterall I'm looking for some outside of my house friends. 
Like I said I work as a substitute teacher and I aspire to making teaching a more permanent thing. Or maybe I will be a Mason. I have been enjoying the freedoms freelancing. I try to work everyday but there aren't always jobs and on those days I have plenty to distract myself with but like anyone I'd like to find someone to join me on some of these free days. 
I want to go visit Woodward Park. I've never been! It's snowy now and I don't have chains for my own car but maybe we can visit fish camp. 
My sister lives on Orange County and I drive out there often. This weekend that's where I will be celebrating my birthday! Maybe you like road trips. I love them. In the spring I'm going to Rock Fiesta in Arizona. It's a camp out and I'm not an experienced camper so, I'm nervous about maintaining a minimum amount of comfort. I would like to sleep well. 2 long days requires some good sleep. Do you like goin to rock shows? I do. It's one of my fave ways to blow my last few dollars. Sometimes it's worth living poor to end up seeing My Morning Jacket, Cafe Tacvba, Deftones, Tool or some other bands live. Let's go see a show together. 
Let's watch some tv. Winter is coming and Game of thrones comes back soon. Maybe the walking dead? 
I like going out for taco Tuesday and having some beers. The Tioga Springs beer garden is nice. I'd love to go back with someone. I've also been to Peeves Public house. They have good prices beer pints and an outdoor patio. Show me a place you like to have drinks. I'm a beer person myself but a mixed drink or some nice whiskey sometimes hits the spot. 
I guess what I'm looking for starts to sound like activity partner but it's not. I'd like to get to know you and become good friends. Maybe we click or hit it off or whatever. 
I into my 30's. I am single. Never been married. 3 exes in far distant lands. 
I like to travel and airfares are dropping right around now. Who wants to go visit Chicago because it's $150 airfare round trip? Let's go have deep dish pizza. Visit a museum or my college pub. 
I into science fiction. I enjoyed the new Star Wars very much. Can't wait for more. This summer's Star Trek is much anticipated. This is tre of probably everyone in the world but still with mentioning I think. I'd like to go see Star Wars again and I might go by myself but I'm putting the feelers out to maybe find someone to accompany me. It'll be fun. 
Having said a bunch of stuff and gone on and on I would like to now add that I am into 420. It my favorite way to relax and I like to go out that way. It's not an always thing but sometimes with other like minded people it can get to be. I still lead an active productive life. Clearly I'm not drug free and I know some of you aren't into that.
I'm ok with marijuana but not really much else. Drinking and toking. That's it.

I'm a normal, educated, and independent young woman, looking for someone special for a fulfilling and exciting relationship. I've achieved many of the other essentials and balances of a satisfying life, but haven't yet found the right person to spend it with. I hold a college degree, a full time job, make a great living, and find plenty of things to occupy my time that bring joy, passion, and welcome challenges to my days. 

I'd describe myself as someone who is very happy on her own, but places great value on finding someone special to share are build my life with. I enjoy having partners with mutual interests, as well as those who have passions for things I may not have been exposed to, as I love learning new things, embarking on new adventures, and shifting a bit outside of my comfort zone; it keeps me on my toes! As far as things I'm interested in, you can find me outdoors as often as possible as the weather heats up, marking up my travel list, finding any excuse to be in or around the water, heading out on spur of the moment road trips and bike riding. I never need much of an excuse to head to the movies, sing along with my favorite artists when they tour in my direction, or just enjoying the quiet of an evening at home. 

I work hard to afford an independent life, and am not the type of woman who is interested in you for your wallet. I'm kind, compassionate, respectful, affectionate, and don't find any challenge in making the important people in my life know that they are loved and cared for. My friends and family are important to me, and I really value developing relationships with people who have connections, interests, and passions outside of me, as I believe nurturing all areas of our lives make us better for each other when we are together. 

I'm 5'8"", brown eyes, a brunette, proportionate feminine curves, libidinous, and a confident demeanor, with pictures that demonstrate all of the aforementioned. I have no interest in casual relationships, and understand that solid foundations take time to develop. I'm drug free, disease free, and drink socially and responsibly. I'd like to think I'm a pretty thorough communicator, will tell you what's on my mind instead of expecting you to read it, and am content far more often than not, as I think there is too much good and joy to be experienced to waste much time on negativity and drama. 

I think I'm a great catch, and I'd ideally like to meet a man who thinks the same of himself! Being humble is important, but I think we also have to know our self-worth. If you've found yourself in a similar boat, holding out for that person that makes your heart beat a little faster, brightens your smile, and highlights your day, then I believe we may just be looking for each other. 

If you're interested, please send a unique message and enjoy your day!

Would you like to meet a woman who is feminine, but not helpless; can be affectionate and playful; does not make unreasonable demands; is not depressed and gloomy; is not a wildly emotional actress; does not drain your energy; leaves you alone when you need solitude; can talk and be silent at the right times; is at ease with you; recovers fast after a crisis; has practical activities and knows that naturalness is beauty?

Are you a man who is inwardly strong and responsible; has a sense of humor; does not pounce on faults; does not think cruelty is strength; is practical in financial matters; is above using threats and intimidations, and does not believe you must conquer the world?

Have you 'been there and done that'? Have you at one time perhaps thought you'd found your dream girl, only to find her turned into a nightmare? Are you tired of being alone and waiting for the 'perfect' woman? Are you tired of answering these questions? Good, read on.

Are you are a gent who would appreciate having an authentic loving relationship with a sane, cute, playful and petite BBW, zaftig woman, who does not want to marry or change you? Well then, hop on that mouse and tell me a bit about yourself!

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, inwhich city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

Have some pretty exciting projects lined up and looking forward to this change in my life. I divide my time between Brooklyn and Berkeley. Making a move to LA in the Fall. 

Looking to meet someone who openly communicates, is down to earth and really fun! I was told by my best friend that I have a type, which I wasn't aware of but here it is: Passionate, wild bohemian spirited,and die hard romantics who have that skater-Surfer vibe like Anthony Keidis. I also like soft eyes and maturity.
My spirit animal is Alana from Broad City.

I'm Puerto Rican. I'm voluptuous/fat. I'm a feminist. A reader. A writer. A film buff. A comedian. A trained cook. 

I'm pretty shy at first but after getting to know me, I can get outrageous . I really value my relationships with friends and whomever I'm seeing. I'm affectionate, loving,intelligent and driven and seek that in a potential partner.My friends say that I am loyal, loving, supportive, playful, passionate,generous and inappropriately hilarious.

Let's start with you telling me a bit about who and what you're looking for and perhaps we'll find a connection that leads to meeting. And more.

Now over 65 years young, I am still active, attractive, bright, lively, fun, and engaged; HWP (5'4""/~137 lbs.); educated, intelligent, articulate; politically and spiritually progressive; healthy and vibrant; an enjoyer of music, movement, wine, spirits, and the herb -- all in moderation (but cannot tolerate tobacco); a lifelong learner, turned on by all kinds of people, ideas, activities.

You are age-appropriate (~60 to 75) and live within a reasonable driving distance of the mid-peninsula. Your description of yourself is quite similar to mine. While I appreciate and respect lifestyle diversity, I get along best with men who, like me, are Caucasian, omnivorous, and monogamous.

Still there? Then please write to tell me about yourself and why you're responding. Your response should include your age, location, and photo(s). If we seem to be a match, I will of course reciprocate.

I'm serious on finding a good dom so please read my ad in full before responding.

SWM age 50+ who can host! Please don't message if you are mixed or just consider yourself white due to geography

Background: Just released from previous dom and due to dramatic changes with life we no longer have time to play. So his last instructions for me was to find a new dom who can contribute to my growth.

About me: Black female, I'm a small bbw, huge tits, big butt, almond shaped eyes. Very kinky and naughty. Sounds good? Keep reading.

Looking for...I am very dominant in my everyday life so in the bedroom, I am very submissive. With the right partner I am a true sub. I play right away but I will not submit right away. Meaning I have to get to know u and like you, and If I choose to truly submit to you I will let you know that in my own special way. I like to please, and I please well. You can I should be able to have normal conversations even if we disagree on a topic. I enjoy being myself and in general I have a fun silly personality and I love to laugh.

About you: I am NOT a masochist, but I do like spankings and want to someday be able to take in a good spanking and learn how to take pain. I want that to be very clear before you open your toy box lol

I could elaborate but I want you to learn about me through play and our own verbal interactions. For a bdsm relationship I would describe myself as a turtle and crab. I will not tell you why or how but if your a smart man you can figure it out. I do not want a switch, I want a man who is a full dom.

Other: I want to always be respected and taken care of. Trust is key. I expect honesty and I expect the same from myself. I recently married my high school sweetheart and we are swingers. I have multiple sex partners and I do not intend to change that. However, I do put my dom first, next to my husband.

You have questions? I have answers. Send me a message ;)

Hi, I am a 25 year old Korean-American woman. I live with my family and work full time. I haven't been in a relationship in about 3 years and I feel ready to start again. I find that it's hard to find a man that can keep me happy or communicate with me. I work hard and I put a lot of my time and emotion to that person when the chemistry is right. I attach to people fast, but I guess it's easy to get hurt when you find out that things just don't work in your favor. I learned to understand that more at this time in my life. I try not to be picky with men. I am looking for a man who can fill in the void but also someone I can build a future with and settle down. Anyway, I will be waiting for replies. Thanks.

There are so many great places to visit, adventures to experience, people to meet and things to do that I look forward to enjoying every minute of every day. I enjoy traveling and discovering the major cities (and country side) around the world. I've been to Paris, London, Rome, Venice, Barcelona, Singapore, and Hong Kong... My favorite activity in each city is to take a walk early in the morning. Every city 'wakes up' differently, try it next time. My favorite cities are Paris, New York, and San Francisco , what about you?

I am an avid cyclist, preferably riding up the hills than descending them. I also enjoy crossfit during the week. 
I am fit and eat as healthy as possible , therefore, somebody with a similar interest would be perfect.

""Soul-mates are not found...they're made""...it is our intentions and actions that lead to a successful relationship....I feel that fate puts us in situations (whether it be CL or Peet's coffee) and what we do from there is up to us.

I always dread getting started, but when I do, I love working in my yard. It's a great workout and I like the sense of accomplishment. It's looking pretty good despite the drought!

Well, it's a little less than a year since you responded to my CL ad. . .and I'm so glad you did. It's amazing that we found each other, considering the magnitude of single people in the Bay Area. Having you in my life as best friend, lover, and the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep, and the first person I want to see in the morning has been wonderful.

That first date was really nice -- we were attracted to each other - both of us physically appealing and dedicated to fitness and good health - and had lots to talk about. And as important, made each other laugh. Things just got better as we started spending more time together, realizing how much we had in common and how much we could learn from each other based on our unique experiences in the world. 

I love that you're always up for a new adventure, whether it's a hike under a bright full moon or a road trip with a reservation at a B and B but everything else left up to what we feel like doing in the moment. The never-ending search for the best dive bar and diner, unusual films, small outdoor blues festivals, favorite and new favorite stand-up comics, and edgy as well as more traditional theater offerings. They're always more enjoyable because I'm with you.

I love that we've each learned about ourselves from past relationships and are clear on what we want and need from each other to keep things balanced and healthy. That we respect and accept each other for who we are and embrace our differences. But, that we communicate well -- not expecting each other to be mind readers. That we enjoy each other's company but can go off and do our own thing - and look forward to reconnecting to share the experience. 

I love that we have a similar sensibility and outlook on life about the importance of environmental, economic and social justice. I may be more of an activist than you, but I appreciate that you let me be who I am and fight the good fight on behalf of those that don't have a voice. 

I believe we bring out the best in each other and make each other want to be more loving, caring and compassionate people - who find the humor in almost everything, laugh a lot, and don't take ourselves too seriously. Happy (almost) one year anniversary. Here's to much more love, fun, and excitement to come.

(Extra points if you know who sang this.) 

As for whom I'm looking for.. I tend to be attracted to men that are confident, honest, respectful, educated, traveled, mature, gentlemen.. the kind that open doors and say/do nice things to a perfect stranger because it's in their nature to be chivalrous. A man that knows what he wants and goes for it. Someone who is understanding, loving, and passionate in the things he does. Sophisticated without being a show off is ideal. A hapless romantic and strong survivor who can handle this unique, educated, funny, sassy, artsy at times, adventurous, exotic, intelligent woman. (Stats: SBF, 5'5, curvy, busty, drk brown hair, brown almond shaped eyes)

If you need a list... the most important qualities that I hope to find in a partner are: 
Humble...Gentleman... Trustworthy.. Family Oriented... 
As far as age goes.... between 35-55 (give or take) ..... 
Height... I'm 5'5"" on a good day and a size 14 so I'm not a small girl but I'm not a heafty hog either. Just a thick chick... 
Caucasian..Latino....Asian...etc... 
Mature.... with a sense of humor because I love to laugh.... and just ready to be in a loving, respectful relationship..! 
Please don't smoke... No drugs.. No 420.. 

Reality is that Chemistry is a crazy factor.. and you can't feel it until you meet face to face. So lets go out and see what comes of us.. I would love for you to show me that chivalry, pursuit and strong men who make the women feel weak in the knees are still alive! 

I look forward to your response...

Hello,
I am interested in making a new connection with a special guy who is open to a relationship. He would probably be in his mid forties to early fifties, not a game player, and not looking for a casual fling. I am hoping to start things off as friends, going out for activities such as hiking and exploring the beautiful bay area together. Discovering great new restaurants, stopping at a beach for a picnic, going to live concerts, maybe a museum, baseball games, relaxing at home for a glass of wine and making dinner together, art galleries, so much fun stuff to do, just would be nicer to have someone to go enjoy them with.
So a little about me; I am in my later forties, Caucasian, brown hair, about 5-3"", not perfect looking.. I am small chested, but have a curvy behind. I am not skinny or fat, but could lose a few pounds and tone up. I am a little shy at first. I love animals and have two cats. I am looking for an eventual commitment, and even though I know it might be a ways down the road you would need to be open to the idea of getting married, or we won't be a match. Please don't contact me if you are already in a relationship or married. Also non smoking and no drugs. Thanks for taking a few moments to read this, and if you think we might be a potential match then drop me a message and tell me a little about yourself. Please include a picture with your response and more than a one liner.

That is my idea of a romantic evening together. Just doing something simple and experiencing quiet time with the man I love and enjoying nature. I am looking for a long term commitment with a man who is open to getting married someday. I am in my late 40's, Caucasian, enjoy getting out to the coast, going for walks on days off, lately started reading more books, quick weekend getaways, love chocolate, quiet time, pizza, big bang theory, bones, PBS.

Looking for a gentleman to take a ride to Monterey with. It's not far from San Jose and I am in Santa Clara. About an hour, and there are some lovely sights to see along the way. From San Francisco it's a couple nice hours down Highway 1!

I have driven the road myself, years ago, but I think it's much better to go with a new friend and sing or listen to some nice music along the way.

A lunch or fish dinner would be great, and I know some places because my ex was a weekend diver. I can buy my own meal, no moocher here!

I am short and plump, have some arthritis so can't do too much walking around, but do love to go to the pier and look at the fishing boats, or relax on the beach and watch the waves coming in.

Hi,

I would like to meet a cool companion for spring time outing to explore the Bay Area and cultural outing such as wine tasting in Napa or a round of golf or tennis or sailing.

He is very well-educated, athletic and fit, love of nature and literature, good cooking, play tennis and or golf, fond of classical music and a concert goer in SF.

Having said that, I think meeting like-minded person and who is within a similar age range would be practical to develop a long term friendship for outdoorsy activities and reading and listening classical music.

I am attracted someone that is intellectual, smart, fit and athletic, enjoys at least one outdoor sport, and classy and into cultural activities such concerts and stimulating conversation.

To be practical, that someone special be within a similar age range, 48-56 y/o, and is currently single, of course.

I'm politically progressive, well-rounded person with a diverse interests in performing art and science.
I like someone that is a well-listener and patient, and has a professional career with a happy outlook in life. Are you with a lighter baggage that you have more time for romantic relationship?

The answer is yes, please respond with some introduction about yourself and recent photo.

Cheers.

I usually befriend guys more easily and I'm just looking for a new companion to do fun shit with. I'm a moderately successful, intelligent-ass lady and want to ""expand my circle"" without any expectations of what's to come. A lady never reveals her age (right?) but I will say that I graduated college not more than 10 years ago. I've lived in SF for almost as long & have felt like it's been losing some of its magic lately, so I kind of want to re-explore it with someone new. Like others on here seem to mention, ""you probably wouldn't expect to find me posting on CL""...but hopefully it helps cut through the clutter to find other like-minded individuals. My only non-starter is that I don't really have a tolerance for smokers. Otherwise I look forward to deleting the dick pics in search of some genuine responses...actually, no I don't.

Can you relate to working so much that it seems like you blinked and it's late February? OK, to be completely honest, life isn't entirely all work and no play, as there are hobbies and sports. However, human beings are wired to seek connections, and nothing replaces companionship, and not just friends and family, agree? While it certainly would be great to meet someone with long-term potential, I'd be happy to make a new friend with whom to share a nice dinner with good conversation. How does that sound?

I'm mainstream and practical in many ways, including being an educated professional with traditional family and relationship values, along with a deep appreciation for chivalry. At the same time, I'm very spiritual, and love connecting with others who similarly have a spiritual life and aren't too hung up on the trappings of the human experience. Beyond that, there's absolutely room to play, banter and have fun.

So, with all that said, if you think you might be interested in breaking bread together, why don't you introduce yourself with enough details to give me a sense of who you are and what you are looking for? Please be reasonably close in age to me, as well as in physical location. Also, you must be single and unattached. Including a picture or two is highly encouraged.

Whether or not we connect, here's to a great weekend!

Hello gentlemen, 

I am a 34 year old light skinned African American woman and I am interested in finding a good candidate for a serious long-term relationship. The man that I am looking for is seeking the same in a woman. 

I am not looking to jump into anything. I am looking to spend time getting to know a good man that understands how to treat a lady. Someone who is down to earth, family oriented and enjoys both staying in and going out. I am looking for someone with a good sense of humor that can make me laugh. I am looking for someone who is hardworking, responsible and kindhearted. 

A little bit about me : 

I am single, a smaller bbw, caramel complexion, long brown hair, kind hearted and down to earth. I enjoy a wide array of music, movies and activities. I am hardworking, responsible and family oriented. As far as race is concerned, I date all races, colors and creeds. I do have a soft spot for white men, especially redheads... As for age, I prefer a man to be between the ages of 25-45 but I do understand that there are some younger men that are more mature and some more mature men that are young at heart. 

If you are interested in what you have read and would like to know more, please feel free to reply. Please reply with a picture and tell me a bit about yourself. Your picture for my picture. 

Have a great day and I hope to hear from you soon.

Hi CL,
I'm a curvy, white, attractive, female looking to meet someone special or just even some single friends in my area. I am NOT interested in a one-night stand or meeting a married man.
My biggest problem, and I'm telling you this because I'd love to meet someone who doesn't consider it a problem, is that I'm very introverted. I'll talk your ear off once I get to know you, but I'm quiet around new people and am uncomfortable being the center of attention in large social groups.
I love outdoor activites: going to the beach, skiing, hiking, kayaking. I also enjoy movies, art, music, bowling (even though I'm terrible), and trying new restaurants.

. . .just one man who is age-appropriate (60-75), close in geography (I live mid-peninsula), and similarly inclined (read on).

Neither of us is currently partnered, and we crave the steadfast companionship and deep intimacy we have experienced and expressed in past monogamous relationships. Living long has made us far wiser than we were in our youth. We acknowledge our imperfections and recognize that understanding, compassion, affection, and acceptance are essential to a lasting relationship.

We are both intelligent, articulate people, active and involved, socially and politically liberal, and financially stable. We're still healthy, energetic, and attractive, and we intend to keep ourselves that way for many years to come.

Here are some specifics about me:

I am HWP (5'4"" tall, ~137 lbs.) and Caucasian. Raised east-coast Jewish, for the past two decades I have been an active member of a progressive religious community that includes people of all persuasions. I am omnivorous, and get along best with those similarly inclined. Semi-retired now, I continue to seek ways to contribute my experience and energy to people and projects that make a difference in the world. Among the pastimes I enjoy are music and dancing, puzzles, cooking and savoring good food and beverage, hiking and exploring (especially with my canine companion), flowers and plants, computers and the Internet, movies and some TV, home maintenance and renovation. My social and political leanings are decidedly liberal/progressive.

If you resonate with this post, I hope you'll write to tell me about yourself (age and location are essential!), what you're looking for, why you're responding. When you do, please attach a current photo; I will happily reciprocate if we seem to be a match.

I just watched an episode of House Hunters. A guy named Jeff with a best friend name Susy we're checking out vacation homes in Lake Tahoe. The whole time I'm watching this episode I'm thinking what a handsome guy. He's 6 foot four, 47 years old, and single. There was something about him that intrigued me.

Simple girl looking for regular guy to meet up for drinks/dinner tonight or perhaps sometime this weekend. Recently got out of a thing and would like to get out and do something rather than just hang out at home. I don't have any real expectations that this will work but hey it's worth a shot.. and well work is a drag at this exact moment.

I am 31, in SF, 5'8 brown hair, fun, smart all that jazz. I went to college, have a job and pay taxes.. I'm totally not some gold digger creeper like this place seems filled with. 

If that sound interesting to you, email me. Tell me your age, location and send a PG photo. Ill reply back if it seems like a fit. As I am in the city and would likely want to meet downtown where there are more options. Soma or Tenderloin are cool too. I prefer casual type bars but can feel comfortable most places. 

Also I am real as all real can be. Don't ask me if I am a hooker or send me a picture of your penis. It is a waste of time. Mmmk, thanks! ;)

I didnt know how much i was going to miss you when i was preparing myself for what was to come. 
I didnt even stop to consider my future without you because i always knew i was taken care of as long your around, and i would stop thinking about it because it hurt too much to go there. I didnt consider all the wonderful luxuries you made possible for me to enjoy and i didnt get to thank you properly i feel. 
Thank you for providing the best car i have ever had the priveledge of driving. Thank you for welcoming me into your life and making me feel wanted and the most important part of our home. For thinking enough of me to stand against everyone who had anything to say about our relationship. For being my best friend and taking my secrets to oakhill with you. For everything i didnt have to ask you for, you gave it to me because you knew i needed it. Thank you for making me feel and look beautiful it gave me confidence i never knew before. 
I just wanted you to know somehow that i wish i could turn back time and do ours over again because i would more amazing for you and make you so happy that your heart would last until after i left. 
My life without you is awful. You spoiled me and its hard to get used to not haveing love, or a vehicle or that welcome wanted feeling. I dont even have money for basic ammenities or food most of the time. I feel like an ugly scuzz who gets beat up by an abusive boyfriend like you see on tv. You made it possible for me to look desirable and established. Now i have nothing. Why cant you come back and take me out of this cold hell im in and ttake me back home and have all kinds of sex for years from now? And let me go shopping for christs sake, im better than this!

Love food (any kind, doesn't have to be fancy, just tasty). Love films, especially foreign and independent ones. Frequent museums and theatre. 

I'm looking for a man who is intuitive, introspective, honest, intelligent, adventurous, athletically inclined, tenderly loving, and who values family. Bonus points if you are Jewish, outdoorsy, or love dogs.

A light at the end of the tunnel....I see it getting closer!! I'll be entering a new phase of my life. My kids are mostly grown and will be out on their own chasing their own dreams in less than 5 years. I'm seeking to meet a great guy that is within 5 years of my age and 30 miles of Novato. Logistics prevail if I want to get to know someone. (RECENT UPDATE: Before responding to this post please read all the way through to the end)

Although I'm independent I'd like to find a great partner to enjoy this next phase of life with. Perhaps one that has raised his own kids. I'm looking for an established man that has led an interesting life and has good stories to tell. I also have good stories to tell. 

I'm financially stable and seek to find my equal or better with regards to finances. I love the outdoors. Whereas I once used to like to rock climb, backpack and campout under the stars...my tastes for adventure have tamed over the years to easygoing hikes, bike rides, paddle a kayak and sleep in nice, comfortable accommodations. I still enjoy a good road tripping adventure and especially seek to explore more countries. Ask and I'll give you my bucket list. Nobody is flawless but if you have a good sense of humor, try to practice kindness and can use your resources to fix a problem then you're the guy I'd like to meet. 

I'm not in a hurry to ""jump in"" to a relationship but nor do I want to drag my feet. I consider making friends along the way a bonus. Honestly I'd like to have found a partner years ago but being a full time, single mom hasn't allowed much time for that. 

If any of this sounds good to you. Send me a photo and I'll do the same. Maybe it will go somewhere. Look forward to hearing from you. **RECENT UPDATE: To avoid spam (and those to busy to read to the end) please put your favorite place in the subject line. Thanks and wishing us both luck :)

I am seeking a man who wants to co-create a joyful and conscious relationship that celebrates life and facilitates growth, both as individuals and partners. 

About ME: 
- chronologically newly septuagenarian, but I look and feel 50-ish
- height 5'4"", weight 130s (HWP), pretty face 
- raised east-coast Jewish; now spiritually liberal / inclusive / progressive 
- enjoy wine, spirits, and the herb (all in moderation); intolerant of tobacco 
- own my home on the mid-peninsula 

About YOU: 
- age appropriate (~60-75) 
- somewhat taller and bigger than me, but still height-weight proportionate (HWP)
- geographically proximate (the closer the better....)

About US both: 
- legally and emotionally available (i.e., single/divorced/widowed and not currently partnered)
- seeking a best friend, lover, and partner...for the long term 
- educated / intelligent / articulate
- reasonably fit and in good health (no tobacco) 
- financially solvent / responsible
- active / lively / interested
- liberal / progressive -- socially, politically, spiritually 
- values-based, ethical lifestyle 
- kind, gentle, warm, affectionate, considerate, dependable

Although I appreciate and applaud ethnic and lifestyle diversity, I am looking to partner with someone who -- like me -- is Caucasian, heterosexual, and monogamous.

If you resonate with this post, please write to tell me about yourself, including age, location, and current photo(s). I will happily respond in kind if we seem to be a match.

It's the guy who is well put together that appeals to me. It's the man who isn't trying to be the boy, the gentleman who knows when it's time to be subtle and time to take charge. One who values the building of trust over the catch and release. 

Here's a glimmer of my story; I'm not looking for the love of my life and you shouldn't be either. I am a bit old fashioned but not typical. I am loved but am lonely and one has nothing to do with the other. I am needing the secret that will feed my soul. I want to be friends with the one I am intimate with. I want someone attentive in the interim, can mix things up by having an occasional evening free, you're not too paranoid to meet in public. Someone who will feed the storm while being the quiet place to leave it behind. 

If you are the one who answers every posted ad, kindly don't respond to mine. I'm looking for a ruby in the mountain of rocks. The one who waits for the moment to step out of the shadows because he sees the chance to change the game. The one who knows that a whisper in the dark is as erotic as a touch to the skin. I ask for a man of patience, who recognizes the importance of courtship. 

Your photo needs to be accompanied by just the right words. My definition of a handsome face isn't always what society dictates. It's just a starting place. Make your impression wisely. The first ones do count. 

You are 45-60 years of age, and a tall man. You're stable and smart and for the most part kind. You understand that small talk is part of the seduction, that naughty chat is a lazy way to get there. You'll enjoy texting or online chatter rather than emails. You don't smoke. You're not looking for a super model any more than I am. You have standards, and recognize that I do too. 

Now let's see if you exist...

Hey,

I'm looking for a Catholic friend to go to church with on Sunday mornings (not to be confused with a ""friend with benefits""). So if you are only looking to date, this might not be the best option for you. 

I found a church I really enjoy that has great music, interesting homilies, and a vibrant community. If you have a favorite church, please let me know! I'm a very social person and am looking to meet someone that loves going to church, and wants to strengthen and uphold their relationship with God. 


Bonus points if you enjoy hiking and running as well.

A little bit about me: 
I go to church every Sunday and enjoy singing every song (even if I don't know all the words ;) !! I recently joined a bible study group and that has been awesome. I'm an optimist. In my free time I like to read books and exercise outdoors. 

If you are Catholic, please send me an email with the following:

I'm an energetic outgoing single good black woman that work hard and can hold my own and looking for the same in a good man. I believe life is what you make it and it's twice as nice with the right partner. I do think chemistry is of the utmost importance; however honesty, integrity and loyalty are keys to a great relationship. I like doing thing inside and outside, traveling, shopping comedy; music concerts working out and plays in addition to cooking and just about anything as long as I am not harmed and at times watching TV with that special one just doing whatever.
I have kissed a few frogs and I'm ready to kiss my last frog to get to my life partner.
I'm a youthful 50yrs old, 5'7 a little thick in the hips (however no complaints from the men thus far) LOl love to dress up and down in a part of jeans. Oh yes and please send a picture if you would like me to reply.

I look for Real Life with it's Real Challenge, Pain, Love, Disappointment, Trust. I'm REAL!
Below you'll read my thoughts about how a relationship between two sophisticated people, the seniors (!), should start.
This is deleted twice a day. I think it doesn't fit the education level of CL population, does it?

I strongly recommend those who look for just sex to pass me by.

Someone said that I'm ""edgy"". Actually, I'm NOT edgy nor hardened. I'm Transparent, Kind, Warm, but also Selective. And I know that To be Happy Means To Be Understood.
If you overcome a feeling of discomfort caused by the unusual directness of this text, I'll send you my REAL pretty poetic and philosophical, very long profile.

I'm NOT an American nor Asian woman but am a US citizen, who is ready to share my beliefs with you. 
And here it goes.
. 
Before jumping in the man's arms, a smart woman who respects herself, knows who she is and who she looks for, has to see a potential partner in different life situations.

It's NOT about a trip to a restaurant followed by a hookup! NO!

Actually, there isn't too much to find out at 60+ , as the main part of our journey has already been finalized: we've got education, built our careers, raised the children and made a certain number of mistakes which we would like to avoid repeating.
Yes, too often we betrayed our inner being for different reasons, and this time we have no right to lie to ourselves.
It seems to me that what a decent and honest woman, looking for a partner for a final chapter of her life, needs to think of is: 

1) how this man relates to her in terms of her views and beliefs ( I have a high spirit, believe in education, am opposite to feminists but can't be told what to do by anybody. I greet the wind in the face!), her attitude to politics (I'm active and passionate about what I believe in. In short, I'm an activist), the work she does ( I'm going to never retire as I love my profession and can always work part time, while having an opportunity to choose when and how much to work, and this is my way of expressing myself in life);
2) how compatible their characters are. (I'm peaceful, friendly, dignified, not materialistic and not diplomatic-just desperately sincere and unable to stand insincere, indecisive and fearful beings.) I can't be ""controlled"" by the man as I'm absolutely committed by nature. I will ask for advice myself but won't stand constant ""corrections"". To put it in a nutshell, I'm Not a Follower and Not a Leader. I can only walk by the side of my equal. An ""alpha male"" isn't my match for sure.
3) if they are compatible sexually. By this age, too many men have lost their potency while women, after having given all they should to the children and families, are still up to experiencing the richness of love life with the Man they Can Respect.

Right, it's Very Hard to Meet Such Men on Dating Sites. 

We love with our soul and body, don't we? I'm passionate and intense if in love (You know that Love Is Demanding, right?), and I want to be on fire, while not every man wants and is capable of giving himself to the relationship fully. 

I'm a devoted and reliable friend, and I need to feel the reciprocation of the same level; otherwise, my feminine pride will push me to leaving. 

4) The eyes are a mirror of the soul. So, the eyes are more important than anything else. Mine are big thinking and smiling eyes, and you can read a lot in them as I'll look Directly into your Soul. 
Appearance of a potential partner is important not only to men but also to women. But men don't need to be ""cute""; they need to be Handsome and Manly. 

People say I'm an attractive and elegant lady.

5) the attitude to money and income is usually a deal breaker. None of us is eager to partner a loser or user. In my pretty traditional view, it is normal if a man earns more and acts like a gentleman in any circumstances. On the other hand, to be an independent woman doesn't only mean to be able to support herself, it means to resolve her problems on her own, which I'm used to do successfully. 

In general, interacting of a potential couple with an outside world (not just the super-limited world of their shared bed) can either make them closer or tell them that they are not compatible at all.

People need to feel a click at different levels, and the INTIMACY includes so much! It may start during the hike people go on together, during volunteering, at the concert hall, where they both are thrilled by the performance of an orchestra, when doing charity, promoting business and sometimes helping each other. But accepting help or gifts requires the reciprocation, which a woman at the stage of OBSERVING usually is not ready for. 

I'm deadly tired of both pushing away the jerks from dating sites and of talking with much older men, who want to warn me that my search for True Love with a True Man while having my Very Thick Filters on, is severe and devastating for myself.

I'll try!

I think that, in case I decide to be close to a man, I won't want to move to his place right away. At this age people have completed so many tasks ( study, child rearing, career), that, if they want, like I do, to have a Very Close Relationship with a Like-Minded partner, it's better to really focus on how they feel their togetherness and how they feel interacting with a world as a couple before making a serious decision. They need to stay in their familiar environment, do their jobs...
You remember that I have even a longer text to share with you, right? I bet, you'll impression will be just opposite to the one you've got from reading the text in here...
Your Serious introduction with an image is welcome!

Smile!

I remember a proverb ""Hope dies last"". Do you?

Greetings.
I'll try to stay positive although it's not so easy after reading some ""calls"" of men and women for ""having fun"". 
English isn't my native language. Although I'm fluent, I believe there is something in my Tone that is hard to appreciate and understand to Americans.
I've decided to re-phrase some American woman's profile and tell about Myself this way.
See what I've got.
""Hazel-eyed, intellectually insightful, aesthetically inclined, sensitive, spiritually attuned, nature grounded. I like words!
Interested in co-creation of a new chapter of LIF with wit and laughter, depth and daring. Appreciating challenging stimulations combined with peaceful calm. 
Youthful in body and mind, energetic and engaged with the world, 
valuing kindness, integrity, creativity, especially humility, humor, wisdom.

In early 60's, attractive, active, artistic, aware, mature and childlike.

Seeking LOVE - to love and be loved, for the rest of our lives, 
starting with mind commonalities, and kind, great heart, then body, spirit pervading all. ""
So, that woman and I look alike indeed, at least because we Like Words, Depth of the Spirit and Arts. Also, at 60+ we can act very young.
We are also alike in Not Getting Responses from Quality Men. That woman and I WANT you to TELL about yourself, your interests, BELIEFS, pursuits, circumstances. 
Unlike too many prostitute-like ""sirens"", we, NORMAL ladies, look for a KINDRED SPIRIT. All the rest comes next!

I've been listening to Vince staples, nosja thing, e40, Josephine baker and others. I have tattoos. I'm pale. I like to smile and compliment strangers. I use to play video games. Stanley parable, unfinished swan and journey being my favorites. I eat with a verocity. I dream. I smoke spliffs. I don't like pills or anything else. Don't even drink or smoke cigs. 

What I'm looking for: not something serious. Just looking to meet amazing people. Make new friends, share my love, my knowledge and create things with others. Let's make music.

Looking for a connection, maybe prince charming, maybe you...

While I'm not sure that craigslist is the best place to meet people, I'm figuring the odds couldn't be worse than the dating sites. You're far more likely to be here, casually perusing CL out of curiosity, than at a bar or on a dating website.

I am smart, independent, accomplished, confident. Don't take myself or life too seriously. Generally will try anything once and have a great sense of adventure. I am a college educated white collar professional who works hard to keep her work/life balance. I have a sense of humor, sometimes witty and often smiling.

You are someone who can appreciate all that I have to offer and offer much of the same. You are charming, a gentleman, confident and secure in who you are. You know how to share and converse and understand the value of participating in the process of getting to know the other person. In the age range of 40-50, have your life and career together, and have done well for yourself.

If you'd like to give this a go, please take the time to write and share. One liners, graphic pictures and the like will be deleted.

I love yoga and personal transformation. I am committed to intentional communication and cultivating skills for more pleasurable connection and authenticity.
I love to dance, and would be especially excited if you know how to lead East Coast Swing or Blues (or are interested in learning).
I am Jewish and NeoPagan. Same would be lovely, and open to complimentary paths (BuJew, Humanist, etc). The quality of being a mensch (a person of integrity and honor) is more attractive to me than someone who happened to be born Jewish.
I am passionate about living a life of quality and joy!
Big fan of Doctor Who.
I have been to Burning Man several times, feel mixed but generally inspired about the experience, and will probably go again.
I would love to soon live in an ecovillage.

You are a single man probably between 33 and 43 who resonates with what I'm saying and how I'm saying it. You enjoy and value geeking out about and implementing best practices for relationship, touch, and living well. You are monogamy minded and want kids. You're ready to find the right woman and cultivate visionary partnership.

If you choose to reply, please include some thoughtful message about how this resonates with you, your age, a bit about you, and whatever else seems relevant. Thanks!

5 months is a very long dry spell for me, but given the catastrophic level of heartbreak that occured, it was probably necessary. I'm mostly back to my giggling, flirtatious self. Unfortunately, efforts to find a suitable tall drink of water have been mostly fruitless with the exception of a few rainy night fumblings in a car with a hot chef. Fun yet frustratingly adolescent, and leaving me feeling no less virginal.

People are so blase about casual sex these days, but I need to be treated differently. More respect and patience is required to score with me. So the months of lonely nights continue. My 39th birthday is in about a month and my sole wish is to be sexually active again.

The first problem is geographic. I live/work/play in San Francisco and can't host due to my squished housing crisis situation. So a man must provide four walls and a bed within lyft distance of downtown San Francisco. And not just for a one night stand.

I'm also in need of a sexually attractive man roughly 28-48 who is single, intelligent, and with good manners. Mad seduction skills. I know, who do I think I am, asking for so much. Right? I should just settle for a drunken poke in an alley with the first guy who offers, but I just can't. I need quality.

If this sounds like the job for you, please write to me with photos. Please. Don't write to me with no photos.

I'm a very curvy, fat, full figured and shapely plus sized woman. Very fair skin, long dark hair, pretty face, killer style, youthful, ultra feminine. If I sound like your general type, you will be pleased. I'm also very experienced in matters of the heart and sex, while still somehow maintaining an air of innocence, vulnerability, even naivete.

I'm not sure how I will ever fall into bed with a man again. My guard is so up, I'm feeling so protective of myself, and not very patient with men. It will take a special level of skill to solve this problem. Help!

I'd recently started a new employment in the north beach area (near the square)... Most days it's busy to the point where I just work through lunch and grab a protein bar to go. I'd love to be able to make a new friend who works/lives in the area who can convince me to actually take my lunch break and chill.

I am most attracted to military type, tall (at least a few inches taller than myself), dark or light (white, black, Latino, etc) men who appreciate a thick Asian woman. 

I am in my early 30s , Asian with very short hair, a lil under 5'6"" thereabouts, very thick n curvy. Educated, good balance between being mature and responsible and silly. Love to smile and make others laugh.

I would prefer to meet people a few years older than myself. Current or former military a plus. If you're into swimming, learning about other cultures and languages or bike riding (motorcycle) that's a plus. No drugs or smoking/420.

I do have a somewhat sarcastic humor but am usually pretty shy when I first get to know someone.

Please tell me a bit about yourself and send a (recent, no older than 3 months) clear face pic if interested. I will return same should it seem like it would work out. 1-2 liners will not get a response. 


PS: Am just looking for an activity buddy at first but open to more if the chemistry is there.

PPS: please know the difference between your and you're...and know when to use which!

ADDED: I may have given the wrong impression... But when I say lunch, I mean an actual meal... 😛

I really enjoy having my breasts suckled and would like to find a man interested in exploring an ANR.
This would be about building intimacy, exploring sexually and could evolve into a long term relationship. I am not interested in any kind of mother/son role play, it's more about the act of nurturing and the erotic nature of having my breasts stimulated in this way and creating a close, intimate physical/emotional bond. If it turns sexual, which is likely and in my interest, I prefer both of us be monogamous. 

I'm looking for someone very close to me in San Rafael who has a flexible schedule. I am not currently lactating, but would be interested in inducing lactation if that seemed right. 

I'm in my mid-30's, never married, no children, I live alone and am completely single. I am fairly short and curvy. My breasts are DD's, all natural and very amazing. I am happy to share more details with you after receiving your sincere interest. 

I'm not looking for casual sex or to hook up. I will want to talk on the phone, meet in person in public (maybe a few times) and get to know each other. I know it's a long shot, but maybe the right person in out there.

Hi I am looking for A man who is looking for love - not sex, not a pen pal, not MARRIAGE
A man who gets give and take and also gets that there is not a lot of changing going to happen at this stage of the game on either side.
A man who knows how to satisfy a woman: PERIOD. NO EXCUSES. If this is not in the picture, then I will definitely be open to friendship-basis relationship - but the future is uncertain. I will keep looking. 
Postpone the discussion of ""exclusive"" for 3-6 months, but at the six month mark, if the man doesn't bring it up, I am gone. GONE - I am not pressing a guy into anything ever - I don't have it in me. And I won't be bringing it up either - there is no point.

Hello, I go through ads on Craigslist and other personals, dating sites and apps, etc. Not unlike myself, I notice a lot of men simply looking to connect with someone. To talk to, to relate with on whatever you're going through and in that same regard there are those seeking to care for someone who needs companionship. I've met some of the best men this way, and have found myself looking forward to leaving work and going straight home to chat online with him. Technology has been kind in helping make the experience even more fulfilling. We all need something, but other needs can interrupt the happiness and satisfaction connecting with a perfect stranger can bring us. Let me get to my point. I'm a single parent of a one year old child. I barely have an income, and when I say barely I mean less than 750$ per month sometimes. I'm doing my best in being a devoted mother to my son and to keep my morals in tact which is probably something I wouldn't have done in the past had I been having these kinds of money problems in the past. So I'd like to try something new. I'm not opposed to meeting in person but the idea in my head is more like connecting with a man who is looking for a friend, someone to flirt with, dream about, hang out on our web cams together and allow yourself to be 100% comfortable with being you and not fear being vulnerability because I'll be right there doing the same with you and just help each other.

If you're a man who wants to go there with ne and has the means to help my tiny family with whatever you feel, I wanna give you my time and a part of my heart as gratitude for at least offering me some peace of mind. I want someone to make me feel like its gonna be ok and I wanna do the same for them. 

Email me something about you and let's take it from there. Ill exchange pictures via email as well.

It's been lonely living alone all these years. It feels even lonelier when I face leaving the expensive Bay Area when I retire in five years, moving far away, all alone, leaving my friends and life here. Therefore, I seek a man, within 8 years of age 60, living no more than one hour from San Mateo, CA, where after 1-2 years of dating, we move in together, agreeing on retirement options. However, years ago, I made an oath I'd rather be lonely than in a bad relationship, having been alone now for almost eight years, the longest I've ever been alone. 

I simply seek a happy enough relationship which involves we enjoy each other's social and erotic company and don't argue over money. Socially I enjoy: city culture, (live concerts/especially jazz vocals, ballet, museums and movies) outdoor beauty, (nature strolls, easy cycling/kayaking and hot springs) and emotional stability/maturity with honest integrity to offer genuine friendship. Although I am no longer idealistic as I was in my youth, having embraced life's ironies at age 60, my youthful hippy liberal values still persevere. Erotically, I am the slow sensual type, bordering on tantra, open to minor kink and need total monogamy. I'm usually drawn to guys who keep themselves relatively in shape, I making it the gym 2-3/week and doing some yoga. Financially, I only earn $70,000, but have no debt and significantly save. I don't eat out much, preferring to spend my expendable income on concerts. I eat simply, mostly soups, salads and stir fries, eating mostly vegetables with meat to flavor. Although I'm healthy, taking no meds, I have some minor ankle arthritis and am a carrier of HVS 2. As I rent, I'll certainly have to move when I retire. At this point, I'm considering buying a small home in Eugene, Oregon, a small college town with culture, but open to other areas.

If interested, kindly reply, describing yourself, as much as I have described myself in this post.

I'm going to be honest. An open relationship with a wonderful man is my perfect ideal relationship.

I want someone I can be friends with. We have to have some things in common. I'm a bit of a nerd, I watch sci-fi shows. I love classical literature. I love music, going out dancing. I drink socially. I love to get prettied up and going out so I would love to be with someone who wants to do that with me. I like the beach, hiking, picnics, going on long drives. I love travelling anywhere fun, especially if I have never been there.

I'm sort of expecting some creeper replies to this, lol. I'm not just looking for sex. But along with any sexual relationship I am looking for a friend. And also someone who is interested in exploring other relationships, while still staying true to ours. I know this is sort of a gray area, but really what is comes down to is I want to connect with someone that I am also physically attracted to. I am tired of being with people who deal with jealousy because I even look at another guy. There are tons of wonderful and beautiful people in the world. For me, sex isn't something that should just happen between you and one other person. It's an experience that is different with different people, and it's fun to explore.

All that being said, I do long for one person to share it with. Someone to come home to. Someone who I know is always there for me. 

If you are a man, around 30 years old, and feel the same way, feel free to drop me an email. :)

Originally from Europe. I live now for many years here in the USA, and like it very much! So how can I describe myself? First, I am real, do not play games (so I love scrabble besides other games), am centered, funny and can be goofy at times, choose to see life from a positive view, have a zest for life and love it! Love the outdoors, am ecologically very aware, more on the liberal side.
I am a very friendly, passionate and romantic, calm, warm hearted, caring, intelligent, very educated, open minded, energetic, very active and creative. 

Am more softspoken, sensitive yet strong, and seek my partner, best friend and soulmate. Some of the qualities I seek in my partner are kindness, compassion, is passionate, sensual, very affectionate and romantic. ""walks his talk', knows what he wants, can communicate his feelings and also has some form of spiritual practice.

I have many interests, some of them are: reading, literature, arts, music, going to bookstores where I can get lost at times, creative projects, cooking, theater, writing, and much more. I dont like to be around angry or negative people, dislike drama, life is too short for that. I see the glass half full, like to focus on the good in life by choice. I am interested in spirituality, consciousness studies, mysticism, philosophy, environmental issues, Ayurvedic medicine, mediation, yoga, tantra (tantric spirituality and philosophy, and yes its more than just sex!), and am learning more about it. 

When you write back to me let me know how to get in contact with you (by email), am sincere in my search and a picture is greatly appreciated! I am looking forward to hear back from you, and the best of luck on your search

I live in E'Ville and work in the City. Do the car pool. So, not so much stress.
I live alone but spend time with friends going out to dinners, cultural activities, cal performances, and often go to the city, both for trying new places, theater, museums, festivals, exhibitions etc.
I'm 49, stand at 5'6"", medium built, some say cute ;) 
I am looking for a highly educated gent (a Phd, a medical doctor, attorney, MBA, someone a serious professional, who is also interested in reading, traveling, museums, and have their own intellectual pursuits and interests). The reason I am looking for this kind of person is because, all my life I have only dated people who are smart and intellectually inclined.
That does not mean that we can't be little kids again, or we don't share mundane chores around the house, or cook bbq and enjoy cold beer.

Hope to hear back from you soon. I know its going to rain this weekend. Well, that is not a bad thing if we start writing to each other, or start texting :)
Have a nice evening!

I don't know if i can find anyone on this service. I can only describe what i am like and what i am looking for, then hope for the best.


I am pretty special and people always remember my face, even if i don't remember theirs.
It's hard to describe why, but i am racially mixed, like to wear artful clothing and jewelry, 
have long hair (no, it's not white, it's still dark but for 2 white hairs). People say i am pretty, and look a little younger than my age. I am on the feminine side (not 100%).

Also, i am really fun, make you laugh a lot (i am trying my hand at stand up comEdy so you can be my audience, OK?), lovable, intelligent, educated


What i am looking for is love, trust, a relationship and friendship, hopefully, if that can be found here. Sadly, this site is so full of pornography that people seem to think that that is all it's about,and just send pictures of their genitals. Hey, don't send that to me. I am never going to answer you if you do. 

I want a genuine, loving, creative, local guy (within the bay area, not off in Fresno or Modesto or something like that....no good to make lots of global warming) who wants to have a real friend and hopefully real love. If you want to start really slowly and carefully that is good for me.


I am in very early 50s, and seek someone around 45--54 (not much out of this range please).
You must be non-smoker, no drugs or other vices (being a workaholic is a vice to me. I want someone with time to be together and have fun).

My preference is medium dark to dark skin, dark hair, not too tall and not fat. Sorry, i don't go for blonds or really light skin and eyes. I am on the small side and have some leftover pounds from being a mama, but it is disappearing with all the dance classes i go to. I like the gym as well and we can go together if you like. 

You still have your hair, or most of it, NOT bald or shaved head please ( yes, i have mine, and it's long, and growing).

I have a big preference for guys who love humor, smile, treat me really well, have a good relationship with their families and don't shy away from commitment.

Here is one important point: I don't like TV. If you really like it and watch it a lot this won't work out.
I don't even have one and don't plan on getting one. I am too busy, for one, but besides that, i can't stand commercials, and frankly, i don't like to sit and watch it. To me that is just wasting life itself.

I want someone who loves to dance (my likes are cumbia, samba, Mexican music, Zydeco at Ashkenaz is fun, reggae is OK) so we can enjoy that together.

KPFA 94.1 FM is on a lot at my place, and i participate in a lot of the marches and demonstrations announced there, so i want a progressive like myself, into progressive movements like Black Lives Matter (Brown Lives too), Living Wage, Stop Gentrification, Immigration Reform, and the like. 

A lot of my time goes to dance classes, and there is a summer college class i am starting pretty soon. I do have time on weekends and love to be together then. I love to go to street fairs, programs at Ashkenaz or La Pen~a or Mission Cultural Center, throw parties or dinners, weave (yes, i do this) and do other art-y things, try new places and things. 

I like to take photos and am trying to learn to make good video.
If you have similar interests maybe we should meet up. Please tell me about yourself and what your interests are, what you do for a living, where you live, if you have kids, etc. Please write enough so i will know if this is worth pursuing.

If you are vegetarian that is cool. I am not but don't eat any red meat, and usually avoid dairy too. I list4en to Mario Martinez on KPFA and he says that those who live to be 100 are Not vegetarians. . ..interesting. . ..but i don't eat red meat because It is not too healthy and it is not sustainable for our planet. . ...for the same reason, i don't want anyone far away. . .Global warming sucks, so let's avoid long drives OK?

I am single mom (only one kid, now a teenager) and the two of us live alone together. It would be nice to find a person that eventually will be my partner, so we can live together. I live Bay Area, not too far from San Francisco (i know, it is expensive). I am not too into the suburbs.

Please make sure you really want a friend/partner before you respond. I am pretty tired of these people who disappear after 3 or 5 emails or calls before we even meet. It makes me think they are married (if you are, or if you have a girlfriend or anything similar please DO NOT respond! Single guys only).

You have to be into long, deep conversations, good at listening and talking, value upfront verbal communication and being straightforward. I am very straightforward, and don't like silence or non verbal gestures that don't speak outright. We are not mind readers and should not have to be.

Please send me your photo when you reply, a good photo that shows your face clearly. I can send you mine if this looks like it has potential.

Are you loving? Did you ever long for a soulmate? What is your idea of a soulmate?

To me, we don't have to be with each other all the time, we don't have to watch the same movies, but we are one, but live in two bodies, but we are independent, ying to the yang. We are one and not at the same time.

Interested in dating. I'm not looking for anything serious nor a fling I'm open to love, it's just something that isn't planned. Chivalry, integrity and enjoying life are important to me. 

I have an ill mother that is more independent today than she was last year. I'm very thankful for that. In my free time you may find me at a festival, the beach or ????

I'm only interested in meeting men that are not legally married. I don't feel the best way to get to know a person is in text form. I like to meet people. Not interested in relationships cross continents etc. Please tell me a bit about yourself: location, age, interests, etc.

We will start by simply talking about the weather and our favorite sport team.
It only takes one man who is serious about getting to know each other. 

If you enjoy laughing, talking, cuddling, cooking, the SF Giants and intimacy, lets talk. 

I am 54 yrs old. Divorced, white female. I am 5'3, dark brown hair and eyes. I am a plus size-full figured woman with olive complexion, round hips and thick thighs. I have an outstanding personality. I am funny, loving, intelligent and accept people for who they are. I am in search of a long term, intimate relationship that will include adult nursing. I am not interested in a quick hook up. I am self sufficient and am not seeking someone to take care of me but rather, we take care of each other. 

My life is drama free and my home is warm and cozy. I love to cuddle on the couch while watching a movie or baseball/football, stroking your brow and running my fingers through your hair and kissing you softly. I do not smoke or use drugs and I drink socially and am disease free. 

I enjoy live music, festivals, SF Giants (how many days away?), SF Niners, card games, board games and the outdoors. I am a great cook and also enjoy baking. I am a big Walking Dead fan.

You: Between the ages of 45 and 58; NON SMOKER, NOT MARRIED, drug and disease free; are from either Sonoma or Marin County. You are intelligent and have a strong ability to communicate.

I am looking for someone who I can be comfortable with, have chemistry with, and enjoy spending my time with. I want to laugh at dumb TV shows together, enjoy taking a weekend trip, watching a movie, grocery shopping, and whatever other simple things we do.

I am looking for a fun sexy man who can make me laugh and sweep me off my feet. I am looking for someone who is drama free, honest, funny and mature while still playful. I am a large white BBW. Long brown hair and green eyes. 5'4 with 48DD and wear a size 28. I am a working single mom who is extremely loyal, drama free, and very family oriented. Once i am comfortable I am very sexual with the right partner and enjoy exploring each other.

I prefer Black men, someone close to my age 30-42, tall, handsome face, hopefully mobile or local. I have always had a thing for bad boys, and although I have grown up and not looking for the problems that come with that I would love to find someone with a bad boy look...tattoos are a huge plus. 

Basically I am ready to fall in love, head over heels with the right man who is ready for the same. I would love to get to know each other and see where it can lead! If you think you could be my Mr. Right then please get back to me with your age, location and a pic and we can take it from there. Hope to hear from you soon! xoxo

Accomplished, successful, very attractive Black female seeking a male for a serious, long-term, female-led relationship. For clarification, this is not for sexual fetishists or to fulfill someone's fantasy. Although I am a novice to this type of relationship, after much research and review, I have determined that it is the best fit for me. It represents the type of lifestyle that I would like to live with a like-minded individual. That is, I desire a man who receives his pleasure from providing me with love, romance, emotional support and also seeks the level of intimacy and connection that I seek. Basically, he is my best friend and is devoted to me. He is receptive to my leadership and guidance, aware that although he may have input into our decision-making process, the final decision rests with me. Although I expect that we will have a happy and healthy sex life, I would like my partner to be receptive to the possibility of cuckolding. Types of punishment for my partner will be determined jointly as will rewards for his loyalty in ensuring my overall happiness and contentment. I have no interest in BDSM types of punishment(i.e: caning, whipping, slapping, etc.) nor will I dehumanize or demoralize my partner. Ultimately, together we will develop a relationship that works the best for us. Other characteristics that I desire in my partner is that he be between the ages of 37-55, intelligent, educated, successful in his own right and financially stable. He must have an Alpha presentation in the ""outside"" world but be submissive to me in the home. I am also a sapiosexual-I am sexually stimulated by intellect. I believe in full-disclosure; therefore, it is important that any interested parties be aware that I have had HSV Type 2 for 15 years. Because I have behaved responsibly, I have infected no one. I am receptive to any questions or concerns you may have regarding my status.

For those of you who may find this type of relationship and/or my status objectionable or offensive, I ask that you refrain from sending me vulgar and disgusting responses. Just don't respond.

To the individual who has determined that my post required flagging, despite the multitude of dick pics and vulgar requests notorious for this website, I urge you to find another outlet for your frustration.

I'm looking for a sweet guy who can hold up his end in the conversation and can make me crack a few smiles.
About me. I'm 27. SF native. Teacher. Always cheers for my home teams. Loves the Giants and the Warriors, vanilla lattes and 90's hip-hop. I'm kinda a mix of Leslie Knope and Liz Lemon. I have Leslie's passion and love for what she does and Liz's sense of humor and cynicism.
Be. 24-34ish. If I sound like a girl you want to talk to, send me a message telling me a little about yourself. Please only reply if you send me an actual message saying something. ""what up"" and incomplete sentences do not count as messages.

So, I figure that even though this is craigslist- odds are that some normal people may be reading these, even if just for fun.😜
A bit about me. I've been described as more of a girl next door type. I prefer being outside instead of shopping or movies ( even though both are fun in moderation)
I go to the gym and eat well, and keep busy with good friends and family. I have young kids who I have more often then not- so whoever I add in my life needs to be more then ok with kids.
In a perfect world I'm looking to meet someone who will add to my life in all the best ways. Who will be one of my good friends and partner in crime (and I mean that figuratively not literally😏) have a strong physical attraction and that extra factor. I'm not looking for someone who is old enough to be my father-no offense- and I'm not interested in meeting for just a hook up, ( this is craigslist I'm sure you can find that if your looking) 
This is craigslist so my hopes aren't to high...If you've read this, and think you maybe fit what I'm looking for then write me back. We will never know if don't try it out. Please send a photo and I'll send one in return.

By no means is this exhaustive, since the qualities of you keep becoming...

- I like your calm, open demeanor and ability to talk with anyone about personal and non-personal & existential things with ease 

- I like that you are pleasing for me to look at, listen to, smell, taste and touch, and that these qualities are growing and becoming more rich as we share time together

- I like that we share other important people in our lives with each other

- I like that we explore new activities individually and together

- I like that you appreciate and want to have your own time, and treasure being close to me regardless

- I like your ability to be clear, communicate and openly talk about your feelings

- I like that you adore my daily compliments of you and your person, and that you strive to be more amazing each day

- I like how you receive my advances, and the comfort we share as we explore our romanticism 

- I love kissing you, any time, any place and for any reason. I love the discovery that our lips bring us

- I like the ways you show yourself to me, and how you show me what I mean to you

I look forward to expressing the other qualities of you that I adore! And I know we will meet soon :-)

People need relationship, and me too. That doesn't mean I am a very easy person. I am kind of being assertive and a little bit cold. I know I should be sweeter but my job doesn't let me. Sometimes, I just want to quit everything and be myself but responsibility ties me down.

A light at the end of the tunnel....I see it getting closer!! I'll be entering a new phase of my life. My kids are mostly grown and will be out on their own chasing their own dreams in less than 5 years. I'm seeking to meet a great guy that is within 5 years of my age and 30 miles of Novato. Logistics prevail if I want to get to know someone. (RECENT UPDATE: Before responding to this post please read all the way through to the end)

Although I'm independent I'd like to find a great partner to enjoy this next phase of life with. Perhaps one that has raised his own kids. I'm looking for an established man that has led an interesting life and has good stories to tell. I also have good stories to tell. 

I'm financially stable and seek to find my equal or better with regards to finances. I love the outdoors. Whereas I once used to like to rock climb, backpack and campout under the stars...my tastes for adventure have tamed over the years to easygoing hikes, bike rides, paddle a kayak and sleep in nice, comfortable accommodations. I still enjoy a good road tripping adventure and especially seek to explore more countries. Ask and I'll give you my bucket list. Nobody is flawless but if you have a good sense of humor, try to practice kindness and can use your resources to fix a problem then you're the guy I'd like to meet. 

I'm not in a hurry to ""jump in"" to a relationship but nor do I want to drag my feet. I consider making friends along the way a bonus. Honestly I'd like to have found a partner years ago but being a full time, single mom hasn't allowed much time for that. 

If any of this sounds good to you. Send me a photo and I'll do the same. Maybe it will go somewhere. Look forward to hearing from you. **RECENT UPDATE: To avoid spam (and those to busy to read to the end) please put your favorite place in the subject line. Thanks and wishing us both luck :)

I am in my 50s. Fit, decent-looking, with a great job and grown-up children. Educated, well-read and well-traveled. I want to try and find the right man on craigslist, although not quite sure if this is the right place for that.
The man of my dreams should be single, educated, and most importantly - willing to find the right person as much as I do. I have some special requirements: when I say ""educated,"" I mean formally educated, with a college degree. I am very much attracted to smart people. Yes-yes, I know that a degree doesn't guarantee intelligence, so don't bother to tell me that. But it's Silicon Valley after all, and everyone is entitled to their idiosyncrasies. 
Wondering why I don't mention any other qualities, either mine or my dream man's? Because I personally don't trust all those ads describing how wonderful people are. You should find out for yourself what is in reality, not just on paper.

Now that that's outta the way, I'm a single mother of 3 beautiful children that mean the world to me. Please understand they will always come first. If you don't like kids feel free to move on at this point. I've been single by choice for a bit now and decided I'm ready to change that. Between working and taking care of the kids I don't get out a whole lot so figured I'd try CL. I'm 35, brwn hair, blue eyes, 5'5"" with a thick build. If you don't like bigger girls that's cool just move on. I enjoy spending time with friends and family, reading a good book, cuddled up watching TV, swimming, bowling, fishing, camping, having a few drinks, dancing, bbq's, and more. I do have a few tats and piercings. Now I don't like liars or people that like they are sneaking so I'm gonna lay everything out cause I have nothing to hide. Yes sadly do to some situations ( nothing illegal or anything) I currently live with my folks, working to change that as soon as possible. Just letting that be known. As for what I'm looking for. I would like to find someone around my age 28-40, preferably someone in shape. I have a thing for a man with muscles, not a deal breaker if you don't. I'm interested in white or Hispanic. All in all I'm looking to make friends and see if it goes from there. If your still reading and any of this interests you shoot me a message. All emails must have pic or no reply!

Hi there,

Nice SAF here, looking for a nice man who stable and ready to settle down, to have family and kids. He must non smoking/drugs, has stable job, easy going. If you're serious, please write me an email, your age, and which city do you live in.

Fit, fun, feisty (and flawed, too) professional gal ISO compatible companion for adventures in life, love, and learning. . ..really longing for love again.

About you. You're an active, smart, fit, present, patient, engaged and engaging non player in the 49-56 year old age range. You're 5'9+, well groomed, and know how to treat a woman. You are conversant, compassionate, kind, and healthy in body, mind and sprit. You've got a broad world view, a spirit of openness, and are eager to meet a decent woman. Ideally, one of your greatest virtues is patience.

Me? I'm a petite, blue eyed brunette with boundless energy, a ready smile, and an open heart. Often hear that I look good. Avid hiker who particularly enjoys many of life's simpler pleasures, among them daily exercise, healthy living, children, animals, laughter, the arts, good food, good conversation, lotsa lovemaking with the right one (very important), more laughter. I'm slightly alternative with a preference for the road less travelled. Strong connection to nature, so daily walking has been critical to my well being. I lead an active, sometimes colorful life, always guided by a strong moral compass. Traditional values, monogamy, kindness and integrity are at my core, and at yours as well. If we are compatible, we have a good time no matter what we do together. I'm not a fit with most and discerning about who I do spend time with. 
Still hopeful that you're out there. 
Are you?

If any of this resonates with you, I'd love to hear from you with a non generic reply (no pics please - still enjoy the element of surprise). Preference is to speak by phone fairly early on- we'll know rather quickly if we'd like to meet. As a traditionalist, prefer good old fashioned person to person contact vs. a text, phone or e-mail buddy. Thanks.

Peace

Hello, I am am 34 years old from the Southern IL/ Western Ky area. Fist let me start by saying that I am a BBW in transition. I am currently a size 16 but I am losing weight due to having the gastric bypass surgery. I'm at this weird place in my life where I feel like im too small for some and still too big for others. I have long dark auburn hair (but I do change it up sometimes) Grey/blue eyes (that sometimes look green) and I am 5ft6.

I am completely single. I have no children, and have never been married. What I want more than anything is to change all of that! I would love to find a SWM in the age range of 28-40(ish), located LOCALLY (within 30-40 minutes) from me. I am seeking a LTR ONLY, possibly leading to marriage some day (No, I'm not interested in ""hooking up"" with you). 

I love a good sense of humor and witty intelligence above all else. Honesty, integrity and compassion are all equally important. Good personal hygiene is a must! (Sad that I have to explicitly state that). You don't have to go to church, but a belief in God is important. No alcohol or drug dependencies!
I come from a good country family. I was born and raised country and I love it! While I like doing things such as ATV riding, bonfires and muddin, I also enjoy things like going to a concert, comedy shows, Broadway shows etc. I don't really listen to country music (I'm more of a classic rock girl) but I'm not going to tease you if you do. My family are avid hunters and fishermen, so if you're one of those people who are in favor of taking everyone's guns- keep walking!

Physically, I a normally find myself attracted to dark hair and eyes, tall men, (well maintained) beards are good. I do like tattoos as long as they are below the neck. HOWEVER, I want to love your soul not your face! The only real request I have is someone who is average to a little extra weight built. Since I am trying so hard to change my lifestyle and eating habits I need someone who can support me with that and not drag me down with theirs. 

I know this is a lot to read so if you have made it through pat yourself on the back! Like I said in my title maybe I'm looking for the impossible, but you never know what you'll find unless you put yourself out there. If I sound interesting to you, message me! I will gladly exchange pic for pic after you send me one *smiles*. Please do NOT send me nude pictures or ask for any from me. To prove to me that you have actually taken the time to read this, type ""I read it!"" in the title of your response please. This is my second attempt here and 99% of the emails started with ""So what are you looking for?"" I really hope you're out there, and you're looking for me too.

Enjoying outdoor activities, dancing or just a quiet evening watching television. Treating myself to at least one great vacation a year.

Hi, Your post was flagged before I could reply, so I hope you find this post because I'm attracted to what I've seen so far and I want to start a conversation. If it goes well, then I definitely want to ask you out on a date, maybe go see The Brothers Comatose or Nicki Bluhm at the Hotel Utah, or horse back riding along the coast off John Daly Blvd?

I used to think that, as an overweight woman, all I had to offer was my personality (which is pretty awesome sauce) but it turns out that I am also a sex object. Who knew? Now I can't wait to have a man use me for my brain.

I am probably most men's worst nightmare because I want a serious relationship. I don't need to walk down the aisle in a fluffy white dress, but I would like to get married at some point. I am not interested in having kids of my own, but if you have them, that is fine with me. So, I won't put any pressure on you to do these things NOW, but you have to see a commitment with someone in your future in order to get a response from me. 

I am a professional woman with a demanding career. I am ambitious and I take my work, but not myself, very seriously. I only work 40 hours a week, and I have many hobbies, so I am achieving some kind of work-life balance. I am looking for a partner who wants to make plans with me, but also wants to succeed in work and explore his interests. I will give you space, but it would be nice to know that you miss me sometimes.

If you are a mature and educated man, with a serious relationship in mind, I would love to hear from you. Sense of humor is really important to me, and I tend to be the funnier person in the relationship, but I would love for you to show me up. 

I have posted before but never seem to connect with anyone long-term. Follow through is important. I am a woman of action looking for a man of action.

I am content knowing that I can love again, after divorce and after disappointment
I am not a drinker
I am not a smoker
I am a lover of champagne, once in awhile to set the mood
I have some good skills that you might find out someday
I am a lover of a clean well-shaved face on a man, no matter what his age
I am a lover of a mature silver fox, a man of sincerity, that might want love again


So, these are some of my am's, and I have am nots also. I have some arthritis (like many of you) which slows me down, I have a couple of other things that bug me (like many of you). I don't play beat the clock, or hike mountains, or bike long rides or walks. I am what I am and can do what I can do.

I am looking for a special guy, for whom I will be enough. I am earthy, and I am sweet if you treat me right and take the time to get to know me. Coffee is just the first step to many more.

I am here, I wait for that special guy to stick around awhile.

Yes, true. He told me that once. I found him at a bar in the Tenderloin a little before last call one night. He seemed to have had a few too many kamikaze shots and started over sharing with (lucky) me. Apparently the kid who he had been working with for the last few years is no longer a pussy and isn't afraid of the dark anymore. Furthermore, he said that the kid was starting to get into Dubstep which was driving him mad during homework time. I guess all this wasn't exclusively on a Monday, but the night I met him was. 

Right now, I am trying to hold on to that thought. While this Monday isn't back-flip-outstanding, at least I don't have to deal with dubstep from some snotty pubescent kid. Also at my work I have unlimited coffee, I bet that jerk kid didn't.. Well work isn't really that bad, I love my job, my mind is just very much somewhere else today.

Anyway if you are still reading, good for you! There is no boogie man pop quiz at the end but extra credit is always available. Among other things you may enjoy are some facts about me:

-For some reason the way pomegranates look creep me out
-Drink 1-2 cups of coffee per day
-I am tall and have nice teeth
-On my desk I have 3 plants, which aren't dead :)
-My favorite cereal is fruit loops.
-My bra size is D
-My passport has a few stamps, more to follow..
-I think I still no the Konami Code
-Early 30s but bartenders card me to be nice
-I have little faith this will actually work
-Sometimes I decarboxylate stuff


If you think you can match wits and you're a non creepy weirdo.. Send a note and tell me a little about yourself. If we email/chat and seem to click, I'd be happy to meet sometime for a drink. If we ever saw each other again, you can lie to your friends how we met ;)

Please be 33+ and in San Francisco. Today is leap day, don't ask me if I am a hooker or a robot. Now hooker-robtos, that's the wave of the future.

I'm looking for the real deal, a long term relationship that, hopefully, ends with marriage and family. 

A little about me before we move on to what I'm looking for in a man. I'm 25 years old, college educated, and a full-time healthcare professional and student. I'm tall, 5'6"" and not height-weight proportional. Yes that mean I'm overweight, and if you don't like it, move to the next ad. I'm shy and soft-spoken around new people, but once I open up, you find that I'm dedicated, faithful, family orientated, sarcastic, ambitious, and intelligent. I'm not a country girl, other than riding horses. I like traveling and boating, movies and music, concerts and art museums. I'm comfortable eating out before the opera or ballet, as much as I'm comfortable grilling and watching a movie at the house. Just look beyond my looks. Surely there is someone in this city that can do that. 

I've been told that I'm too picky when it comes to my men. I'm highly attracted to Asian men and successful white men. Latinos and Blacks are great as friends, but I'm just not that attracted to them. I'm also attracted to older men, so I'm looking for a guy between 28 and 38. I prefer guys that are taller than me, or men that don't mind if I'm taller than them. 

If you think you're up to the challenge, email me. Change the subject line to your favorite restaurant.

Looking For I've been sitting here for like 20 minutes thinking if I were going to read about someone what would I want to know, I mean what could I possibly say in a paragraph or two to spark your attention and then it hit me! Nothing ha all I can do is speak from the heart and be honest and sincere and hope that comes across... So here goes nothing :) I am not looking for a hook up or fwb sorry that's not me but I don't judge you at all if that's what you're looking for I hope you find it! I'm really just a simple sweetheart. I'm compassionate, honest, intelligent, and I'm faithful and enjoy communication. I am looking for a man who is a hopeless romantic who still opens doors, buys a woman flowers, call just to say good morning and let's his woman feel secure. If I seem like someone you might like to get to know email me a photo and a blurb about you and let's see if we connect and I know that the right person is out there for me I won't stop searching until I find you...

WILL KEEP POSTING, SORRY IF YOU DON'T LIKE MY RESPONSES!

Always looking at blue-eyed men. Blue eyes are my only fetish. Blue eyes get me hot and bothered. 
Some of the men don't however, they can play games and be cruel.

My eyes are brown, thus the super attraction to the blues.
Color of the sea.
Color of the sky.
Color of hope.

I want to stare into your blues while we kiss. I want to wake up to them. I want them smiling at me.

Maybe it can happen, I believe in miracles.

You: blue-eyed devil (more like an angel tho). Honest, kind, single, available, playful, not a NSA type of guy, not really into one nighters. I am really looking for a long-term guy here!

Available to meet, don't get upset in email and delete me. Don't be super sensitive and delete me. Is there hope of getting more than one email from a blue-eyed
guy?

You never know. Over 45 and under 65, some hair on head and no hair on face is my preference.

Send me a pic of your baby blues, no games please. I'll send you my pic and let's start staring and enjoying.
xx PLEASE NO UNDER 45 NO X-RATED PICS

Happy last day of February! I thought I would try my CL luck one last time.

I am an never married, no kids lady that has her act together and is semi-retired much sooner than I thought I would be.:-) My main passion and hobby is acting. I have mainly done commercials and short films. I also have a part-time in home business. My thru thick and thin friends mean the world to me, and I am very blessed in so many ways. I have a deep faith in God and in love and am looking for my mate where it just flows and that has maturity.

Physically: I am olive complected, fit, 5'4, dark brown hair and eyes, and my smile and legs get the most complements.

So you are: Chivalrous, generous, fit ( please you don't have to be adonis..just fit), NO KIDS...no exceptions, are mature and know what you want. A pretty set age range is 46-56. I am 5'4"" so at least 5'7 would be ideal. Please also have your financial act together..no debt except maybe a house.

If you tell me a little about yourself along with your age, marital status (divorced and single only), where you live and a pic. I will respond in kind. I am not looking to start a sound byte conversation and am looking for a long term and respectful relationship.


Thanks for reading and have a beautiful day!

Obviously I am not looking for anyone here . Only those who read through and think you are a good fit should respond ,otherwise pls don't waste your time .

My husband has been been gone for over 2 years , I still miss him , but life has to move on . I have been looking for someone special for a while , haven't found him yet . Friends say I am a little picky --Well , I have to , since this person will be the one you will spend decades of years with , so he must be the one you feel comfortable to see , to feel , to touch , to stay with ,right ? 

I'm a well-educated person with 1 college , 2 university degrees (not in this country ) . Enjoy learning , focus on self-improvement all the time . For most of my career , I worked as a teacher & a manager . 

I am not lack of leadership , but I Do know when and where I should follow , especially on the dancing floor and in the bedroom LOL . I am a mature lady ,but have the silly girly-girl side in nature . I have intense passion for love and life , a people person , can fill in with many kinds of social settings . Can joke around , laugh at my own mistakes and learn from them . 

I enjoy the pleasure from simple things ,but choose not to sweat for the small stuff.

I am pretty a home body , like reading , cooking ... try to eat right and keep simple & healthy lifestyle ,never did smoking/drinking/drugs/gambling... nor date around or sleep around ...... I am not a person who falls in love easily,but once love , it would be 100%. As a strict one-man woman,I remain loyal to him . For the world , he may be just one person , but to me , he will be the whole world .

Like most Asian people , I live within my means and good enough to keep quality life with relatively low budget . 

Unlike most other women, I like books and electronics more than clothes and jewelry . 

I understand we come from different culture background , I have no problem with it and eager to learn more from you . (my deceased husband is Caucasian ). I have a son , a US military boy living in the army base .

The one I am looking for : close to my age , have good education ( bachelor degree at least ) and wonderful personality , ready for the committed relationship ; a home owner , emotionally and financially stable ; I am attracted to the clean-cut professional man .I also hope you are willing to make effort to communicate and good at it .

I am 47, glad to be told look younger than my age . I am a dress lady , have lots of nice dresses . Business casual is my style too . 

If you read down to this far and think you are a good fit , feel free to hit me up by telling some basic things about you: age, height , ethnicity ,education, career , family , kids ...with recent pics attached . I will be willing to answer any question you have for me . I am here eagerly waiting for you to walk towards me !

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, inwhich city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

About me: 

Very pretty SWF, size 4, a looker! 
Professional / advanced degrees 
Avid runner 
Yoga practitioner 
Love all things pink and purple 

My smile and eyes are my most prominent and attractive features 
I love the woods 
I love staying up late and seeing the dawn, lazy Sundays in bed with you 

I love to have fun and cut up with someone special - once a special relationship has been established 
Trying to teach myself Italian (slow process) 

A smart, quick thinking man is the ultimate turn-on for me 
I am delightful, delicious, demure, even dainty, subtle, sweet, sexy. 

The type of man I seek: 
I am seeking a successful, confident, and intelligent SWM, 56-72, who knows how to enjoy life. 
A man who will break his routine and try something new, or maybe try something new that he did not enjoy 7 years ago, 
like to learn a new language, a new dance, a new sport (i.e. - cross-country skiing). 

I am seeking a man who is looking for one woman to be his partner - a man who wants a longterm companion to engage in discovery with. 
Prefer a SWM who is well-educated (grad. degrees), sensitive and moved by nature, animals and the arts, a gentleman, kind to everyone 
(including waiters :-), 
successful in his chosen profession and he should still be excited about his professional work. 

Note - a man who dreads his work would not be a good match for me. 

Important - you must be truly single - not separated or married. Age IS important - I look very young - but I am Not attracted to young men. 
I am interested in meeting a SWM between the ages of 56-72. 

An interesting letter and your photo will turn my head and increase the chances that we meet.

That's the best I can say of myself - and the aspect I value the most. There's other stuff of course - if you happen to care for multiple advances degrees, a fashion sense sharpened like wit to a razor's edge and a worldliness that stops just short of weariness. I'm also an enthusiastic swimmer and dancer, a capable chef and a writer of poetry (unpublished) and prose (selling slowly but still in print).

Among my favorite activities is simply observing human behavior which is why, ever since my time in Washington, I have had a certain affection for politics and politicians not shared by most people I know. I also find it virtually impossible to pass a child without stopping for some kind of interaction - eye contact at least if nothing else is possible. I'm up for just about any kind of adventure in which bodily harm is not implicit. Perhaps my next and most enduring one will be you.

I can't figure it out either but I know you must be out there. I like a companion who is smart, funny, creative, nurturing, offbeat (I am so not mainstream).

Seeking a wonderful gentleman with chemical sensitivities or a man with an understanding and compassionate heart for such a challenge.

I am a beautiful silver fox with a heart of gold seeking a loving, joyful, intellectual, spiritual connection with a man who knows how to love deeply and who knows how to be loved.

I experience chemical sensitivities as a result of of being overexposed for many years to various injurious substances during my nursing career. I know completely that you are out there. I am exercising strong faith that you will manifest in my life in response to my thoughts and desires.

If anything that I have shared resonates with your spirit, please contact me and say hello. I'm looking forward to hearing from your confident, honest, kind, passionate and peaceful self.

First things first: I'm not looking for a hook-up or a FWB! If that's all you're looking for, please don't message me! I'm also not into hanging out for only a week, so I'm not interested in guys who are on vacation in the area. 

I'm Filipina (born and raised in the USA), cute, short (at just about 5'1"") and would consider myself a small BBW that carries herself well and I also have a great smile. I'm looking for someone to become friends with, with the possibility of a long term relationship, but I'm definitely not trying to rush anything. I really do want to find that special someone to share laughter and life with. I'm quirky, love sarcasm, can be quiet at times, but I'm outgoing and friendly, and know how to let loose and have fun. I have a good head on my shoulders, have manners, and know how to behave in public. I have no tolerance for liars, cheaters, or guys who are still in love with their ex. 

I'm attracted to white guys (that's pretty much all I'm attracted to, so it's very obvious to see who didn't actually read this) and it's important that you're single with no kids, non-ghetto, and non-cigarette smoking. I'm looking for someone in the age range of 27-37 and within a reasonable distance to central Contra Costa. 

If you're interested after reading this, send me an email with a face picture. I have plenty to trade! =)

There's nothing better than spending time together with a man that's smart, creative, and a bit sexy. And one who enjoys going to farmer's market for fresh produce!

I'm 5'3, - and in shape, as I enjoy working out. I'm stable, sane, employed, and have my own home. I enjoy cultural outings, outdoor activities, and the genuine companionship of someone in a similar life situation whose interests match my own. I'm well read, politically astute, and enjoy a great conversation.

Now for the harder stuff: I'm looking to expand my social life and possibly meet someone special. A friend first that evolves and grows into something more. I think the best couples are friends as well as lovers.

I'm looking for a SWM professional (white collar) guy who is grounded, reliable, and introspective. Someone who is comfortable enough in his own skin to see the humor in life's ups and downs and can laugh at himself. Someone close to my age who lives nearby. I live in Concord (boring, I know!!)

I like to spend time hanging out in the City catching some lunch or checking out an art gallery and then a hike and out for drinks. Maybe swimming out here in the east bay, being lazy in the sun for a bit, and then going to a movie. Or maybe you teach me something totally out of my comfort zone.

I like fast cars and guys who enjoy speed. Not much beats taking a drive with the top down and the music up loud. I like going out dancing and there is something so sensual as being in the arms of a man on the dance floor.

I like people who enjoy taking a risk and going to new places and trying new items on the menu. You never know until you give it a try!

I also enjoy that connection to spirituality, whatever that means for each of us. I believe there is a greater power out there and that gives me a lot of satisfaction and peace. I'm a beginner when it comes to meditation but spending some quiet time going inward helps me deal with life's challenges.

I'm attracted to a confident man - one who is driven by the need to succeed - but who also has another side to him. A funny, silly side. And understands the work/life balance. And, who when teased, can laugh at himself a bit. 

If my posting interests you, please respond back with your information- age, hobbies and background, and a picture.

I am an attractive semi-retired professional who has several qualities and interests. I do not look my age and this I owe to my parents for their genes. I enjoy all sorts of music, sports and many other interests. I am real, enthusiastic with excellent sense of humor. 

One of the many passions I have is cooking. What makes it complete is enjoying a wonderful dinner, candlelight, wine with a great gent and maybe with a fireplace!

I would love to meet a mature, decent, honest, caring, witty, financial stable guy with integrity. Please be a happy person with passions, dreams and be healthy! If you are obsessed with working out at the gym and afraid to eat, I am not your lady! Just be a romantic with patience! I prefer men within the ages of 58 -- 74. 

What would be great is to have ""A Kiss At Midnight"" with my gent once you get to know him (not on first date)! I know this is dreaming but where would we be without dreams! 

I am not into texting to other States or countries so do not waste your time as I am only interested in dating someone in person.

I just read nother posting about d pics, you should too! Every word of that is true and you should keep it in mind at all times! I's serious, mood KILLER!! Anyway, with that being said fellas read thru some of your fellow ""MAN""-kind's postings! Go on just do it, no you wont be considered a homosexual or anything stupid like that! No one will know! Just pop over there and read a few, you will soon find out why women are so sick and tired of the whole dating situation. We live in the ""Internet Age"", just because you want to hear and say those things, we do not! come on now, put some effort in it at least, damn! This also kills any chance a good guy may have had to find his ""Queen"", ""Wife"", ""Future Baby Mama"" or what the hell ever you call your woman. If you want a good woman, with values, has potiential, actually has something to offer, how about advertising YOURSELF a little better. We all know that men think with their d*** but we dont want your lame ass drunken bar lines. Here's some food for thought, if you give us what we want and need, we'll take care of the REST!

I have spent the weekend with friends and family and have realized how lonely I felt with out a significant other. Most of my friends are in a relationship either dating seriously or married with kids. I am over the dating scene and want a relationship, a marriage, and children. I want someone who I can come home to, someone to cook for, someone to go to bed with and wake up with.
A little about me, I am 5ft, 7in, have a curvy body type. I am active I enjoy walking on the beach or West Cliff, swimming. I also enjoy TV and getting into TV shows. I love animals especially dogs and horses. I don't do any drugs or smoke and drink very rarely. It is a dream of mind to one day be able to live on property and have horses and other animals. I have a job that I love, a car, house, and am happy with my life and where it is at, I am not looking for anyone to complete me or anything. I am just ready for the next phase of my life and that is having a partner and someone special to share my life with. 
So what I am looking for in a guy. I am looking for someone who has an average or bigger then average body type. Someone who is not a health or exercise nut, I want someone who likes to watch TV and gets into TV shows. Someone who likes sports and likes to spend time with family and friends. Also someone who knows where they are going in life and are ready for the next phase of life, please have a job, working car, a place to live, be between the ages of 25-35 years old, live in Santa Cruz County, don't do any drugs including 420. If this is you send me a message, I have a picture that I will share if I know you are not a fake person or spammer. Hope to hear from you. Please actually say something in your reply so that I know that you are a real person.

Hello, 

I've never done anything like this before so I'm not exactly sure what to put in here. I'm in my early 20's, blonde, light eyes, friendly,humorous and outgoing. I make friends everywhere I go lol. I am very realistic and practical, not a drama queen. I love to be outside, I'm an avid hiker, I'm getting ready for a 10k race. I love being active and doing fun things. I have a lot of talents and hobbies but I won't bore you with the details yet haha. Currently still in college in the medical field. 

I'm looking for someone who is looking to start out as friends and if we click then maybe eventually a relationship. I'm not looking to hook up or a fwb. Looking for someone with goals, and has their shit together. My age range limit is probably around 20- 35. I'd like to meet someone who is looking for something similar. I may not find what I'm looking for but its worth a shot

Well I am getting older, but still young at heart. Usually I feel fairly cheerful when in good company, gardening, hiking, or playing music, but recently I have to stand up with Bernie Sanders and shout ""Enough is Enough!"" Yes, I am leftwing, organic, very grounded in the earth, scared to death by what is going on politically, environmentally, socially, economically. Still trying to fight the good fight and do the right thing and all that stuff, but it sure would be easier to do it with someone else. Do you like to garden? Time to plant and I need some help. And I'd share the vegetables and cook you something with them. It would be a gentle way to get to know someone, to see if there is a cooperative spirit, an appreciation of nature. A friendship? and maybe more. Maybe. That would be nice. I don't think its a fairytale that two people are supposed to grow old together helping each other down the pay, lightening each other's load, brightening each other's day. You should be somewhere between 58 AND 68, not be a smoker, and not drink much.

. . .just one man who is age-appropriate (60-75), close in geography (I live mid-peninsula), and similarly inclined (read on).

Neither of us is currently partnered, and we crave the steadfast companionship and deep intimacy we have experienced and expressed in past monogamous relationships. Living long has made us far wiser than we were in our youth. We acknowledge our imperfections and recognize that understanding, compassion, affection, and acceptance are essential to a lasting relationship.

We are both intelligent, articulate people, active and involved, socially and politically liberal, and financially stable. We're still healthy, energetic, and attractive, and we intend to keep ourselves that way for many years to come.

Here are some specifics about me:

I am HWP (5'4"" tall, ~137 lbs.) and Caucasian. Raised east-coast Jewish, for the past two decades I have been an active member of a progressive religious community that includes people of all persuasions. I am omnivorous, and get along best with those similarly inclined. Semi-retired now, I continue to seek ways to contribute my experience and energy to people and projects that make a difference in the world. Among the pastimes I enjoy are music and dancing, puzzles, cooking and savoring good food and beverage, hiking and exploring (especially with my canine companion), flowers and plants, computers and the Internet, movies and some TV, home maintenance and renovation. My social and political leanings are decidedly liberal/progressive.

If you resonate with this post, I hope you'll write to tell me about yourself (age and location are essential!), what you're looking for, why you're responding. When you do, please attach a current photo; I will happily reciprocate if we seem to be a match.

Looking to meet someone and make a good connection. Maybe meet up for a hot or cold drink sometime soon. Looking for someone in the San Rafael/surrounding areas. Looking for honesty, chivalry and someone who knows how to treat a girl right. Good conversation, some chemistry and see where things go. I am 44, on the heavy side but do participate in gym like activities. I love good wine, good food, cooking (omnivorous but make a lot of vegan/vegetarian meals), love the local farmer's markets and smooches. I am interested in a relationship, I enjoy being part of a team and like both shared and separate interests. I don't really do the make up thing and love PJ time at the end of the day. If you feel like sending a pic that's great but either way send me an email and tell me a little about yourself.

I'm looking for somebody with whom I have true resonance: we have both done genuine personal work and have come to deeply know ourselves, both the light and the dark aspects that ebb and flow within. We both know that passion and sexuality is powerful,even necessary; but it's not the foundation on which to build a truly holistic partnership -- rather it's a wonderful byproduct of conscious communication and intentional intimacy, true shared interests and multi-dimensional chemistry, deep respect and honorable actions.

Hi,

I would like to meet a cool companion for spring time outing to explore the Bay Area and cultural outing such as wine tasting in Napa or a round of golf or tennis or sailing.

He is very well-educated, athletic and fit, love of nature and literature, good cooking, play tennis and or golf, fond of classical music and a concert goer in SF.

Having said that, I think meeting like-minded person and who is within a similar age range would be practical to develop a long term friendship for outdoorsy activities and reading and listening classical music.

I am attracted someone that is intellectual, smart, fit and athletic, enjoys at least one outdoor sport, and classy and into cultural activities such concerts and stimulating conversation.

To be practical, that someone special be within a similar age range, 48-56 y/o, and is currently single, of course.

I'm politically progressive, well-rounded person with a diverse interests in performing art and science.
I like someone that is a well-listener and patient, and has a professional career with a happy outlook in life. Are you with a lighter baggage that you have more time for romantic relationship?

The answer is yes, please respond with some introduction about yourself and recent photo.

Cheers.

I'm looking for a worldly, witty companion to share adventures and excitement. Well-read, well-mannered, and, well, available. No one in a current relationship, thank you. 

Have a connection on both the mental and physical level is important to me as it sparks the attraction- it also the search a challenging one as it's unpredictable. 

I'm most attracted to men who are intelligent, confident, articulate, witty (second appearance of this word!), experienced in life.

Tried to make this happen once, guy really tried to pull a bait and switch. He had subzero interest in health and fitness. Lol. Don't do that. Don't feign interest for a hookup. Because it was a major fail and he was rewarded nothing.

Hi - 

I'm a great lady that's enjoying living life to the fullest. I""m in the start up phase of starting my own side business and that's challenging but never boring. I have a close knit family and some really cool friends. I enjoy meeting lots of different people. I do not have any kids, but it's okay if you do.

You: Should be between the ages of 29-55. Please have a job, some education and a great sense of humor. Most of all be fun to hang out with!!!

I am NOT looking for a one-night stand or a fling. If that's what you are looking for then please look in another section. Also, there is no need to be sending me naked pictured, I really have no desire to attend a nudist colony.

Send me your picture and I will send mine in return.
If you do not send a picture - sorry but your email will be deleted and not even looked at.
Make sure you read the sentence above. If you want my picture, please send me yours.

I'm always up for a new adventure :-)

Let's make some memories!

I'd love to find someone special for an LTR. Looking for ridiculous chemistry..... Too much to ask? I don't think so! I've lived in great cities in the US and in Europe and the Bay Area is hard to beat, even if dating poses a challenge. But I'm super positive, rather attractive, almost erudite, somewhat sarcastic, most certainly single, definitely slender, sweet and sexy, downright funny, always non smoking, and not seeking exactly the same.... But someone similar would be nice. :) Please be over 40. Please include your clear photo with your reply. Your pic gets mine!

So I'm very stoned and I feel the need to shake things up. The rainy weather is dreary and girls just want to have fun!

You are a very attractive single kind man who has experience with ladies and can even have them over to your place. Your place is in or near to San Francisco, because that's where I am mostly always. I don't go that far because, you know, I love it here and lazy.

I am a silly girl sometimes who laughs often and being a fat extra T&A curvy BBW type, I jiggle when I laugh. Some men love that about me and some men want hardbody type ladies and that's totally cool but not me, not at all. So if jiggly laughter is your style, yay!

I can be mellow too, especially when I'm stoned and I really miss hanging out and talking and making out since I've been single. It's hard to meet kind funny men who are sexy, especially when you mostly socialize and work with all gay men and women. I love my life but I don't really meet many red hot blooded heterosexual men types except maybe in highly transient situations like public transit or lyft line or walking down the street.

So I feel like there has to be at least one man like this in or near San Francisco who will respond to this post with a recent cute photo of himself and a blurb that seems relevant and then I can send him a photo, and maybe more exchanges and then maybe we can meet up like at a bar or something like that, and then maybe if we like each other we can like, get to know each other and maybe laugh and maybe make out. I know this whole scenario seems super challenging, but who knows. It could happen.

First let me start off by saying I'm a ""bigger girl"" so if you aren't into that then please hit the back button or exit out. When I say I'm a ""bigger girl"" I don't mean super plus size but more like a size 12. I'm Latina, I have a big bum and I'm very pretty. 

I'm looking for a long term relationship. I would love to fall in love, get married and start a family. I come from a tight knit family and would like to find someone who comes from a similar background. Growing up one of my parents was always home and we had dinner as a family every night. That's what I want when I start my family.

One very important factor in finding a partner is my love for daddy/daughter role play. In public we are a loving, normal couple and behind closed doors we have this relationship. You being my daddy domme and I, your good girl. 

I'm college educated and although I could have a ""big girl job"" I choose to work a simple job that gives me time to work on my art. If that bothers you then this won't work out. Having a creative outlet is a 100% must for me. My job is fun, pays the bills, and I'm still able to afford my own apartment in the city. It's not a luxurious high rise but it's my own space and I love it.

Things that I enjoy...

I'm very into fashion. I appreciate fabric, construction, I love nice things. I always look put together and I'd like to date someone that's also fashionably conscious. 

I'm a foodie. If your idea of a date is going to Olive Garden (I've never been) or some chain restaurant then this won't work out. The city is full of amazing restaurants and trying a new place is part of what makes living here so fun. With that being said, I'm not sure I'll stand in line for two hours for a bagel. That's a bit extreme plus you can use postmates or some other app and not have to wait. 

Some days I just want to stay in and cuddle. I love cooking and having a partner that cooks would be nice. I've always wanted to take one of those couples cooking classes. Yes I know how silly that is but I still want to do it and hopefully you'd be open enough to just go along with it. 

Art.

Netflix marathons. You have to be able to binge watch with me. Not all the time but it will happen and I'll lay on the couch with my head in your lap and we'll get through all the seasons. Haha. Okay...maybe not all but most. 

I love weekend trips. I love getting lost on Airbnb and favoriting places to visit. I'm someone that wants to stay in a treehouse in the middle of nowhere and in the cute little camper. I'm also down for a nice hotel but appreciate kitschy more. 

Music...very broad in what I like. Pretty much anything but prefer indie/folk. I do not like any of that rave edm music. 

Being outside, museums, going for drives, taking photos, being silly, making things, collecting twigs, painting, laughing, going for walks, going to all the cute coffee shops, puzzles, alameda flea market, gardening, reading...idk what else to list. 

I'm not religious but do believe in a higher being. 

I'm looking for someone who is older than me, college educated, nerdy, dorky, preferably tall, mostly attracted to white guys but I'm open, family oriented, genuinely nice and must have a positive outlook on life. I'm someone that's always in a good mood and would like the same in a partner. 

I'm not sure what else to add and realize that it is now 3am and I'm very sleepy and probably didn't do my best writing this. But that's okay. 

If I've peaked your interest please respond and attach a photo. Tell me about yourself and what you are looking for.

You= not republican 

Must have really good hygiene 

Also very into bearded men so bonus points for that.

*please do not flag*

I'm lonely in the city and really want to meet someone.

People say they first notice my bright smile, friendly personality, and they say that I'm easy to talk too. I'm a good listener and will only give advice when asked. I've got a good sense of humor and love to laugh - but always in good taste. I'm a straight-shooter and as genuine and sincere as they come. I'm laid back and down to earth but I get very passionate over various topics. I work with kids, I love what I do, and I'm really good at it. I put my heart and soul into everything that I do. Living a active, healthy lifestyle is paramount to me - I'm not good for anybody, let alone myself, if I don't take good care of my mind, heart, and body. I'm detailed, organized, and admittedly ""slightly"" OCD... but just on some things ;-)

I consider myself to be a modern woman who enjoys the freedom and independence that a good job provides but I'm also old-fashioned in my desire to find a clean-cut man with similar beliefs and character qualities that make him stand out as a strong, humble leader who's confident in who he is, where he came from, and passionate about where he's going in life and he'd like nothing more than for us to join forces together as a team. I'm hoping to find that rare honorable gentleman who is wise, kind, caring, thoughtful, selfless, loyal, generously affectionate and totally over the moon about me - and me for him. I want us both to encourage, build up, and challenge one another to learn and grow and even call each other out (in love) when necessary. I want us to rejoice in each other's strengths and lend a helping hand in each other's weaknesses.

My ideal match would be a healthy, physically fit Caucasian, 6' to 6'2"" with strong broad shoulders and a manly frame that compliments my strong, curvy feminine frame. He'd be between 35-45 and have his life in order; single, divorced, or widowed; no kids or share 50/50 custody with his amicable ex. And he's open, ready, and willing to find his best friend, lover, and life-long companion in me :-)

I am on a mission to find my unicorn. I know, it will be very unlikely you match all these qualities, but if you can come close hopefully we can have a good connection- (before you read further, I do not want to have anymore kids, so if you are not already a parent or still want kids, or don't know for sure yet, please don't reply) 

First let's start with me-

Short, cute with dimples, nice smile, 36D, cute feet, big booty but not perfect Kim lol, I am a thick girl, some days thicker then other days but not a bbw, I have two grown kids, I'm funny, giggler, artistic, techie, news and politics lover, love fishing, camping, 420 card holder, filmmaking, photography and much much more

Now the hard part... What I am looking for in a person-

I prefer black men/woman (don't hate and send hater mail just cause your not the one lol) yes I am bi but I am a one at a time and that doesn't mean automatic threesome sorry guys. I want to be with ONLY one man or ONE woman the rest can be discussed in the far future. So with that said, cheaters, players, gamers, Liers and sports heads can move on. Lol

In a man or a woman- great smile, smiles often, great sense of humor sarcastic preferred, can be aggressive and submissive in the bedroom and less aggressive in person, I am a strong leader type but need someone that can also take control.. I like 100/100 In a relationship all the way around.. So if you are too much on either direction we probably won't get along, like if you are too weak or too strong minded, and same with your soul. I prefer spiritual people that believe in God but not religion. If your voting for trump, move on. 

I want someone that cares about meaningful conversations, adventures and amazing sex. 
Prefer an artistic type but would love to find both artistic and techie so left and right brain people like me but not someone that thinks they know everything and isn't still learning. Non judgemental types, I smoke a lot of weed so you have to be ok with that and if you are also a weed smoker, you must be a business handling type.. 
With that said, I am a very busy person but will make time and hope you can do the same if you enjoy some of what I do listed above that's a bonus. 

Now for the details lol

I like..
Men- tall, cute, stamina, strong, but teddy bears on the inside who like extra strong on the outside woman. 

Woman- short, cute, more feminine looking but androgynous attitude like me is best fit, booty, sorry I like it lol, I don't mind bigger girls but I like hour glass bigger, so hips is a plus :) keeping it real lol 

Sum for both sexes- nice smile and funny sarcasm preferred, artistic, smart, sexual, and adventurous, hopefully you don't live too far from me, being so busy, the closer to concord the better but a match is a match hehe

I know, I might be asking for too much but hey! They say if you it it out to the universe it shall come, it's out there lol

It sure would be nice to meet that someone, maybe someone that's just fun to hang out with, maybe more. I don't have to have someone in my life, it's not a need or a want, but like to have or would be nice to.

I'm established, self sufficient, successful in my own right. Thought to be intelligent, smart, funny, easy going. A left brain person with some right brain tendencies. Men interested in me have said I'm pretty, attractive, beautiful even - it's definitely in the eye of the beholder, and I'm on the exotic side. The people who have been drawn to me, tend to like the combination of smarts, wit, charm, confidence and the dazzling smile. :-)

I am relatively fit, spend a fair amount of time at the gym, better than average but definitely not thin or athletic. I look for the same.

I find great chemistry between men who are wicked smart, humble, grounded, calm, funny, have a quiet confidence, charming, extroverted geek/nerd types and it isn't until one nerd's out that they start showing it. Have their life together and remain young at heart. I don't know why it is but the above traits seem to go with jeans and t-shirt types, tech or creative types.

I'm uncomplicated, keep drama on the other side of the moat and I like it that way. So if you're prone to either, there are plenty of others who dig that sort of thing.

If you are inclined to respond, please share enough about yourself so that I can get some sense of who you are.

I'm the dedicated, devoted type of woman who is the intelligent, quiet strength behind a strong, outgoing, intelligent and successful man. Together we make things happen.

Both in our 50ish range, caucasian, fit with healthy attitudes, bodies, and habits...and ready for the new and lasting love of our lives.

P.S. I love to wear red.

I want to live, I want to give.
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
It's these expressions I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold,
And I'm getting old.

Neil Young's words capture how I feel about finding a man who -- like me -- has a heart of gold.

If you're the one I seek, you're a kind, compassionate, caring gentleman between the ages of 60 and 75 who lives close enough to me so we can play together frequently. I'm hoping you share these qualities that describe me: educated, intelligent, and articulate; energetic and engaged; a non-smoker (of tobacco) but appreciator of wine, spirits, and the herb (all in moderation); financially stable and socially progressive.

Physically, I am of average height and weight (5'4""/~138 lbs.), and considered pretty/attractive...but attraction is personal. While I appreciate lifestyle differences, I'm best matched with a man who -- like me -- is Caucasian, monogamous, and omnivorous. I am interested only in men who are legally and emotionally available -- i.e., single, divorced, or widowed, and not currently partnered.

If you would like to start a conversation, I hope you'll reply to tell me about yourself and why you think we might be a good match. Be sure to include your age and location, and attach a photo. I am happy to reciprocate if we seem well matched.

This weather is bumming me out. I'm just staying in, listening to lots of Radiohead and wishing I had someone to hang out with.

I'm average/chubby, smart/snarky, affectionate but introverted. I'm looking for someone who likes talking about music, books, movies... who would be friends and maybe eventually more.

Sitting here on this rainy Sunday Morning.. Awake and wondering what to do today. I remember the days when I was in a relationship and these situations weren't as hard to fill. It is much easier to find something to do when you have your partner in crime. You can find humor and delight in the most simple things, when it's the one. Alas I find myself here. At first I was reading, then I got the bright idea to post and welp, here it is... I guess my curiosity and loneliness have taken the reins for now.

I live and work in SF. I find that I get along better with fellow nerd-like types. It is nice to not have to fully go into the backend stuff to make a small work point. Also I work with mostly geeky-like people and find it is a good fit for me. I would much rather have flip flops on than high heels but perhaps neither on a day like today. I'd much rather go to a star talk than to the mall. Crap like that. Because of this, I input the title I did. 

Perhaps you are tied of the yoga, pink berry marina chicks and want to meet an outside of the box type girl... Maybe you are just as bored as I am at this very moment. Either way, lets connect and see if we can make a rainy day plan. Maybe we could look for a good irish coffee or something to that effect.

I am pretty cute, like I do alright on a 1-10 scale but most importantly I am smart and humorous. Those are the qualities I find most attractive about people. As for you, please be in the city, over 30 and on the taller side. I am a tall-ish girl 5'9. 

If this sounds like you, drop a line :) Make sure you tell me about yourself and give a description. Ill just delete weird shit so save your time on those, hmmk? Thanks!

Hi there! I'm just wondering where all the decent non-whacko guys have gone?? I mean, I know this is Craigslist and all, but I seriously am wondering if there are still some chivalrous, kind, and genuine guys out there. I'm really not going to write out a huge list of please have and please have nots like some of the ads on here have. That's great if you're looking for your soulmate, by tomorrow lol, but not for just finding awesome people to hang out with and see where it goes. I'm a fairly laid back California native, and I'm just looking for someone to hang out with that won't be a super stalker or wants to pick out a wedding venue on the 3rd date. I mean, that's like a 6th date conversation, maybe 7th, lol. So kidding ;-) I refuse to believe chivalry is dead and I'm sure there has to be a guy out there who wants to join me on activities similar to these: random adventures into SF, day trips to the beach or lakes/river etc, drinking a little too much wine and watching a funny movie, or just hanging out at home cooking up something amazing for dinner. Good cuddlers and amazing huggers are encouraged to apply :-) I'm the anti-chick in that I'm not looking for something super serious from the first email exchange we will have. I just want to connect with someone and find someone who enjoys my company as much as I enjoy theirs. All I ask is that you are: not a tobacco smoker, not married or otherwise romantically involved, gainfully employed, not looking for a hookup, somewhat around my age (around 24-38 but not super picky about it), taller than me is preferable, not more than 30 min away from Walnut Creek, and real. Please include a pic and change the subject to ""Partner in Crime"" to weed out spam. Please only email if you are really interested in getting to know me and hanging out. Before my first ad got flagged yesterday, I received a bunch of replies but so many people flaked out after the initial email. Anyways, thanks for reading and I hope to hear from you soon!

However, even when we are travelling I hope you like to be comfortable. It's not important to find the most expensive places but cleanliness is crucial. 

It would be fantastic If you are around my age (or a little younger) who likes to travel, entertains intellectual conversations, and it open to new experiences. One more thing, I own my home and I am financially stable.

Nerdy and Sophisticated Gentleman for Spring fun. 

Hi,

I would like to meet a cool companion for spring time outing to explore the Bay Area and cultural outings such as wine tasting in Napa or a round of golf or tennis or sailing.

He is very well-educated, athletic and fit, love of nature and literature, good cooking, play tennis and or golf, fond of classical music and a concert goer in SF.

Having said that, I think meeting a like-minded person and who is within a similar age range would be practical to develop a long term friendship for outdoorsy activities and reading and listening classical music.

I am attracted someone that is intellectual, smart, fit and athletic, enjoys one outdoor sport, classy, and into cultural activities such concerts and stimulating conversation.

To be practical, that someone special is within a similar age range 46-53 y/o, and is currently single.

I'm politically progressive, well-rounded person with diverse interests in performing art and science.
I like someone that is a well-listener and patient and has a professional career with a happy outlook on life. Are you with a lighter baggage that you have more time for the romantic relationship?

The answer is yes, please respond with some introduction about yourself and a recent photo.

Cheers.

You don't have to look like an athlete, but at least be in reasonably good shape (a little chubby is fine, but not fat).

What I'm NOT interested in is a texting relationship. I actually want to physically meet you in PERSON! A few emails or texts are fine, but I don't want to be your texting buddy. I don't know why, but I've experienced this a lot from guys on dating sites who do this. I want to actully have a cup of coffee with you or go somewhere fun!

Hello there gentlemen,

I am a hard working lady who is also a mother to a wonderful son who is just under a year old. And I know what you are thinking/assuming...that I am looking for someone to play daddy for my son. 

I can rest assure you that is not the case, my son has a wonderful dad that is very much involved in his life just didn't work out for us. So why should I stand back and not pursue happiness when I know that it's not only what I deserve but what my son does too. 

I will tell you what I am looking for, I am looking for someone who doesn't want to play games and has a good head on their shoulders but will also understand that my son comes first before anyone. A good sense of humor is a huge bonus ;)

Besides that, I am extremely into music, dance, traveling, and anything that is fun! Don't challenge me to an arcade shooting game unless you want to be impressed ;) haha

Anyways, send me a pic and I'll send one back. Then we shall chat it up and see where it goes from there. I've never tried CL before, so let's see how it goes. 

May the odds be ever in your favor. Ciao!

You should have diverse interests and a fan of the great outdoor, generally happy and down to earth:) 

Must be:
single (40-47 only), SAFE & CLEAN (drug/disease free), non-smoker, no body art. Not already in a relationship(s) or getting out of one. 

Only respond if you're looking for the same. I value my time and yours. Friendship with common interests is a good starting point. 

>>>Please include a Picture and tell me about yourself.

Hello,

I am a very passionate person and I'm filled with the joy of life. I'm looking for my best friend and the love of my life to share all the magic and experiences of living. I own my business and I'm semi-retired. I love to travel and explore. I enjoy walking, hiking, jogging, water and the mountains, traveling in the US and in Europe, night life in the cities, most kinds of food, a nice glass of red wine with dinner and exploring.

I am into Spirituality, not religion. I enjoy writing stories and poems, playing with watercolors, and sipping tea/coffee over engaging conversation. I'm fairly close to downtown Los Gatos and would prefer someone in the south bay area or Santa Cruz area. 

What I'm doing with my life 
I live in the Santa Cruz Mountains in a redwood forest and I have a lovely home....with sunshine! It is wonderful up here. I enjoy playing in the mud (gardening) and visiting with my friends the deer. They are cute, especially the babies. I'm having a lot of fun writing a novel. 
I'm really good at 
Communicating with people, having fun and enjoying life. I'm a good listener and I love talking with people. I am a curious person and people are very interesting to me. I also naturally validate people as I notice what people are doing/saying. I do it with sincerity and a loving heart. 

The first things people usually notice about me 
I'm very warm, friendly, and easy to be with. I naturally encourage people. I notice nature and truly appreciate all the beauty that surrounds us. 

Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food 
I'm enjoying reading the work of Colum McCann. I love the poet Rumi, Sci-fi, Scott Orsen Card, books about investing and real estate, and about quantum physics, reading Michio Kaku, Amit Goswami, PhD, a good novel, old classic movies, buttered popcorn and almost all food. 

The six things I could never do without 
Being close, family, love, fun, new experiences and new thoughts, relaxing, being creative, noticing and appreciating nature and the magic of life. Oops more than six. :-) 
I spend a lot of time thinking about 
Being intimate with my beloved, traveling and having adventures. Cuddling, flirting. playing, talking, watching a movie and being together. 

On a typical Friday night I am 
Having dinner and a movie with friends or home watching a movie or reading. 

The most private thing I'm willing to admit 
I hired a handyman to check my mouse trap! 

You should message me if 
You laughed recently and would like to meet for tea/coffee.

To those of you who think this is easy well you are wrong, you are still here searching too, so what does that say? It says finding love is no easy task, but I believe it is worth the effort and therefore I keep trying and searching.


I am a Intelligent Afo-American Female seeking a White Gentleman for a Long Term Relationship. I am 5'9, dark skinned female (beauty is in the eye of the be holder) breast size 42, but HWP. I'm mostly attracted to taller, semi- stocky build type of Gentlemen. Someone that has strong positive values, can communicate effectively, has a zest for life, and overall, a good natured individual . 

I'm a big kid at heart, but can be serious when I need to be. I'm not a workaholic, but prefer to stop and smell the roses often. I enjoy home life as much as I enjoy being out and about. Please be somewhat active. If you consider yourself a couch potato, hmmmm, we would not be a great fit. 

I enjoy traveling , hiking, music, fine dining, movies, the Arts and exploring this beautiful state we live in. I'm a non smoker and social drinker. If you're the same, that's a major plus. Generally, I'm a happy individual . I'm easy to get along with and prefer a drama/stress free life style as much as possible. I prefer to make love, not war. I never go to bed angry. I prefer to address issues, find a solution(agree to disagree too) and move on. I'm affectionate, sensual, loyal and monogamous.
You are drug and drama free, nicely groomed over 50 and under 70.

Yes, the dating game is for us older people too! This place is free and you get what you pay for.....hahaha.

Seeking a 45+ single/divorced man, clean shaven, not bald, looking to date and see what happens.

I am a semi-retired lady, a small size bbw, interested in nice, kind people, good intentions, not into casual anything except jeans. I want to only meet men who don't drink on a regular basis, who take care of themselves and don't mind a lady with some padding.

I like daytrips to Monterey or northern California, anywhere near water is what I crave. I'd like a companion to go out to lunch or dinner, to a movie, or share some other nice activity.

I am not an athletic woman. You don't need to be an athlete to make me happy. Just be honest, and be yourself. Have some time on your hands and enjoy dating.

I'd like a picture and I can send mine in return if I am interested in finding out more about you. Don't just ask for a picture right off the bat, I will see how shallow you are!

Looking for a regular guy, someone kind and sweet, single or divorced, someone who is looking around and not quite finding what he wants out there. I play no games. I don't chase, although I do like being pursued. I like a man who shows up and doesn't leave me wondering what happened on our second date (he's predictable). 

I've been around the block a few times. I've met men who were and are scared to get involved. I've met men that want to come right over and do the deed. Guess I've met all kinds. 

I am looking for just one, a regular joe kinda guy. He works, he has good hygiene, good teeth, hair on his head, he's Caucasian and over 50 but not a senior citizen (not ready for those guys yet). He likes to dance or is teachable, likes to hear me sing, loves to kiss, but doesn't think kissing is all there is to life! 

I am looking for someone sensual and fun, but not just into fun. I am a fun girl under the right circumstances but let me meet you and trust you and see if I like your scent and your clean nails, before getting down and dirty. 


It's a beautiful day so I don't know why I'm here, just throwing this out today and see what great guys come in the door. I'm waiting... oh, and don't just ask for a picture as your only talk, I won't send it until we know about each other and there is mutual interest. You can send yours, but I want to know the man behind the photo first!

Hi.

I'm seeking something a little different. I recently got out of a long-term relationship that ended incredibly badly, and I'm still pretty bruised by it. As much as I can miss big parts of what it was like to be in a relationship, I really need to take some ""me time"" and spend a while recovering. So while I could start dating or find a FWB, I realize that's not really what's best for me right now, even if part of that appeals.

But I miss connection, and I've always been someone who has lived through her words and thoughts pretty intensely. So I thought: maybe I could find an online pen pal -- someone to express my thoughts with, talk about everything from the world around to relationships to sexuality, all while giving myself space to heal, too?

I'm in my early 30s, intelligent, with a good life (outside of relationships), athletic and outdoorsy, good at expressing myself and a loyal friend/partner/whatever. I've primarily dated men, but have been curious about more, so this is a w4w ad, as well as w4m. 

If this sounds like something you might be interested in, let me know. I have no idea what I'll get in response, but I thought I'd try.

Hey guys. 

I dont have a ton of hope that I'll find the guy I'm looking for here on CL. But, stranger things have happened. 
I'm looking to meet a genuine man, with a brain, a sense of humor, a kind spirit, an adventurous soul, and a penchant for Big women. I dont have alot of expectations other then respect and honesty. I'm tired of not having someone to snuggle with, someone to travel with, do fun things with, other then my friends. I want something deeper then casual, but I do understand that its got to start somewhere, and I'm in no rush to get to wherever it is we end up. If you're only looking to get laid, I'm not the girl for you. So please dont waste either of our time. Sex is important to me,but I'm not looking for a friend with benefits thing...I have that if i want it, I dont. So if you're sweet (big plus if you're a sexy geek) and it seems like I could be someone you'd like to get to know, let me know and we'll talk. Your pic, gets mine. tell me about you and what youre looking for. i wont respond to any one line reply, or any without a pic (and dont send a dick pic, seriously) take a second and make a little effort if youre really interested. Lets get this thing started.

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, in which city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

Avid runner

Love all things pink and purple 

My smile and eyes are my most prominent and attractive features 
I love the woods

Trying to teach myself Italian (slow process) 

A smart, quick thinking man is the ultimate turn-on for me 
I am delightful, delicious, demure, even dainty, subtle, sweet, sexy. 

The type of man I seek: 
I am seeking a successful, confident, and intelligent SWM, 56-72, who knows how to enjoy life. 
A man who will break his routine and try something new, or maybe try something new that he did not enjoy 7 years ago, 
like to learn a new language, a new dance, a new sport (i.e. - cross-country skiing). 

I am seeking a man who is looking for one woman to be his partner - a man who wants a longterm companion to engage in discovery with. 
Prefer a SWM who is well-educated (grad. degrees), sensitive and moved by nature, animals and the arts, a gentleman, kind to everyone 
(including waiters :-), 
successful in his chosen profession and he should still be excited about his professional work. 

Note - a man who dreads his work would not be a good match for me. 

Important - you must be truly single - not separated or married. Age IS important - I look very young - but I am Not attracted to young men.

An acquaintance tells me that the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else. What do you think - is it true?

My heart is still raw. I long for the touch of a man's large hand, gently brushing my hair out of my face as he caresses my cheek. I so miss soft, fuzzy kisses on my shoulder and neck. I would love to be folded up into strong arms and held close enough to feel another heart beat. I so want to feel safe again, to know that a man has my back and wants to take care of me.

However, I am hesitant, wary, untrusting, and suspicious. I don't want to go thru heartbreak like this again. Is it worth the risk? Does anyone ever fall in love again after 55? Is it even possible to trust someone enough again to be intimate, to trust someone enough to let them into the depths of my body and soul after having been thrown away like a worn out rag?

I'm not looking to be dominated or to be dominant, I don't want to be someone's MILF or cougar, I'm not into threesomes, I'm not polyamorous, I don't want to be your mistress, I'm not looking for a quick lay. It seems that those are most of the desired qualities of men's posts on Craigs.

I am looking for a man who is emotionally available and knows how and when to talk, and who knows how and when to listen. I am looking for someone who doesn't necessarily agree with me on everything, but who can respect that I have my own valid opinions and wants to hear them. I am a giver and a toucher, and I hope to find a man who can handle those qualities and return them in his own authentic way.

If you choose to reply to this post, please be local to the North Bay area, and please don't be offensive or crude - I don't need or want it. Thanks for reading.

Hi. This post is a bit dry and humorless. Seems like I need a bit of fun, excitement, cheering up. Attending arts events and doing girl stuff isn't enough. I can't sleep and the rain makes me long for intimacy with a man. I'm feeling rather hopeless about ever meeting a sexy, lovely single man again.

I'm a genuine woman living in San Francisco. I work from home, and I live with my best friend. I have a small dog. I have more free time than the average adult, but I also require a lot of alone time. I know how to take care of myself, and most of my needs are already met. I am educated, spiritually awake, kind, and pleasant. I've been single for nearly six months, and dating hasn't appealed to me much because I can't tolerate disrespect and objectification. I'm not sure how to overcome this problem.

I'm generally considered to be beautiful, but also overweight. I have a very curvy pear shaped body type, plus a large bust. Fair skinned with dark hair and very feminine. It seems for whatever reason that men can only see me as a sexual object. Perhaps it is my hip-to-waist ratio, my abundant curves, or the fact of my childhood sexual abuse. Maybe I'm just sexy. Maybe because I'm a larger woman, men assume I'm easy or have low self-esteem. Maybe it's all of these things. I just can't seem to find men who can talk to me like a human being, but are also interested in me.

I need to find any man I date sexually attractive. Men seem to forget this part. I'm attracted to youthful, good looking men. Intelligent, well spoken, masculine, single, in San Francisco. Able to have ladies over to your home.

I have photos. Please send photos in your response. Otherwise it is a waste of time, don't bother.

While reading this I'd like for you to imagine a curvy short girl with Middle East looks... If you don't dig it you can stop here.
I need to get back on my feet and I've been lonely for way too long. 
My ideal match is...
-Decisive men - Don't ask me what to do...take control 
- Tall (just love tiptoeing to kiss)
- willing to eloap in case love and craziness is mutual. No big wedding, just us singing a paper and singing Johnny Cash in the car while heading to our honey moon.
- must have a hard sex drive (that includes PDA because that turns me )
- must be athletic (I'm curvy by nature but I hit the gym 6x a week and I love going for long walks. trips,
- is SWM ( I have a soft spot for blond guys I must admit) and close to SF preferably within SF or willing to drive 
- available to date me (at least to hang out on weekends) 
- polite to say It was nice to meet you Goodbye in case you don't like me 
Me... I'll always be a traveler and I need someone like that. I don't ask for a rich guy at all and as long as you don't make me pay for the entire tab that's fine. I would work at Chiplote and KFC for a few weeks just so we could have money for a getaway to Alaska. 
And last and most important... Must to be willing to jump with both feet. I understand relationships take time but I take chances on people and hope to find someone who will take a chance on me

Grew up in Puerto Rico and the East Village in NYC. Been in the Bay on and off since 2002. Navigating my life towards being a professional performing artist. Have some pretty exciting projects lined up and looking forward to this change in my life. I divide my time between Brooklyn and Berkeley.

Looking to meet someone who openly communicates, is down to earth and really fun! I was told by my best friend that I have a type, which I wasn't aware of but here it is: Passionate, wild bohemian spirited,and die hard romantics who have that skater-Surfer vibe like Anthony Keidis. I also like soft eyes and maturity.
My spirit animal is Alana from Broad City.

I'm Puerto Rican. I'm voluptuous/fat. I'm a feminist. A reader. A writer. A film buff. A comedian. A trained cook. 

I'm pretty shy at first but after getting to know me, I can get outrageous . I really value my relationships with friends and whomever I'm seeing. I'm affectionate, loving,intelligent and driven and seek that in a potential partner.My friends say that I am loyal, loving, supportive, playful, passionate,generous and inappropriately hilarious.

I am a single mom who value's family above all else. I am 5'5 with medium length blondish/brown hair and a decent body. I am honest to the core and hope that we can share how sensual that can be. I will never take you for granted and I hope you feel the same..I like to be challenged. I am humble and open minded and like to walk through doors that have never been opened. I banter playfully with an air of coquettishness. I am always looking for a higher mountain to climb. I work hard when I have to but play even harder when given the opportunity. I am a true hedonist when it comes to food and wine. .I would like to meet someone with the same furor and desire..

YOU:
You are intellectual, but not over the top. You are handsome but without the ego. You have good etiquette and value in depth conversations. You don't always have to be right, but welcome the debate. Your financially stable, and welcome a future where you can share the road less traveled. 

YOU AND ME:
Things we could enjoy together? Picnics in the dunes. Champagne with tiny bubbles. Independent films.Cooking something together that we have never made. Hot springs in the mountains. Hiking to our favorite spot and admiring the sunset. Kissing slowly. Talking and listening. Listening and talking. 

If you have read this to the very bottom..I hope you are enticed to respond.
Please include a current photo....

there was a woman who lived in San Francisco and after her ""forever"" prince turned to brass, she went in search of her Knight in Shining Armor (the real deal, not the stuff that turns green), the one who would sweep her off her feet, be her Renaissance Man, and love, respect, and cherish her for their happily after. 

After trying to spin straw into gold for one of her suitors, she learned he was only interested in the gold and not the special talents and qualities that she possesses. He wanted only the brand new gold, not realizing that gold never tarnishes and failed to realize that this craft took years of patience, skill and maturity to master. She didn't lose heart.

Her next suitor tried to awaken her passions to him with a kiss, not realizing that a woman of her caliber though passionate for the right Knight, wasn't an easy score. He tried to ply her with words of empty affection, promises of great intimacy, telling her things she wanted to hear and not the truth, in order to seduce her into his bed chambers. This didn't work but she kept her hopes high.

Next up was a very young suitor who was enamored with the notion of a cultured, experienced, intelligent woman who could educate and teach him things in the arts of love and though she was not particularly attractive and somewhat full figured which might turn off some, he ardently pursued her so that she could teach him these things. She gently put aside his affections because she knew she wanted a full, mature Knight who knew what he wanted and could care and cherish her. She still believes her Knight in shining armor is out there.

Are you the Knight she has been seeking these past few years to find? The one who eclipses all of her former suitors? If you think chivalry is alive and well, please reply to this posting. Please write as if you were sending a message to your future wife and tell her about why you are the Knight in Shining Armour she has been searching for.

Hello, I'm a divorced, college educated, professional female (software engineer). I'm attracted to Asian American men ( Korean, Japanese, Chinese). I just like the look of asian men. :-)

Interested in professional, easy-going man with a sense of humor. Seeking someone clean cut, well-rounded, and educated. Family, friends, and a balanced & healthy lifestyle are important. While I'm looking for the right LTR I'm not looking to rush things. Let's have fun getting to know each other and take it from there. Here list of a few more things I'm looking for.


-Non Smoker
-College degree
-Be financially responsible
-Single/Divorced (separated is not single or divorced)
-D/D free
-A nice/good guy
-HWP
-No facial hair
-Be available emotionally and have time to put into a relationship. I know we're all busy here in the Bay area but make sure you have the time to put into a relationship to give it the best shot of working. 
-Live within 20 miles of Fremont.
-I tend to do better with younger men... I'm 53 but have been told I look to be in my early 40s. Ideally 40-55 would be my range but I wouldn't disqualify based on age. 
-Most importantly I'm not looking for a guy to just settle down and grow old with.... I want a true dynamic and passionate connection. I'm looking for all the trapping of a relationship. 


If this sound like you, drop a line and tell me about yourself, No one liners, please use complete sentences and send a G-rated picture. In your reply post your location so I'll know you're real.
I'd like to exchange a few emails and then talk OTP before meeting.

There's nothing better than spending time together with a man that's smart, creative, and a bit sexy. And one who enjoys going to farmer's market for fresh produce!

I'm 5'3, - and in shape, as I enjoy working out. I'm stable, sane, employed, and have my own home. I enjoy cultural outings, outdoor activities, and the genuine companionship of someone in a similar life situation whose interests match my own. I'm well read, politically astute, and enjoy a great conversation.

Now for the harder stuff: I'm looking to expand my social life and possibly meet someone special. A friend first that evolves and grows into something more. I think the best couples are friends as well as lovers.

I'm looking for a SWM professional (white collar) guy who is grounded, reliable, and introspective. Someone who is comfortable enough in his own skin to see the humor in life's ups and downs and can laugh at himself. Someone close to my age who lives nearby. I live in Concord (boring, I know!!)

I like to spend time hanging out in the City catching some lunch or checking out an art gallery and then a hike and out for drinks. Maybe swimming out here in the east bay, being lazy in the sun for a bit, and then going to a movie. Or maybe you teach me something totally out of my comfort zone.

I like fast cars and guys who enjoy speed. Not much beats taking a drive with the top down and the music up loud. I like going out dancing and there is something so sensual as being in the arms of a man on the dance floor.

I like people who enjoy taking a risk and going to new places and trying new items on the menu. You never know until you give it a try!

I also enjoy that connection to spirituality, whatever that means for each of us. I believe there is a greater power out there and that gives me a lot of satisfaction and peace. I'm a beginner when it comes to meditation but spending some quiet time going inward helps me deal with life's challenges.

I'm attracted to a confident man - one who is driven by the need to succeed - but who also has another side to him. A funny, silly side. And understands the work/life balance. And, who when teased, can laugh at himself a bit.

. . .just one man who is age-appropriate (60-75), close in geography (I live mid-peninsula), and similarly inclined (read on).

Neither of us is currently partnered, and we crave the steadfast companionship and deep intimacy we have experienced and expressed in past monogamous relationships. Living long has made us far wiser than we were in our youth. We acknowledge our imperfections and recognize that understanding, compassion, affection, and acceptance are essential to a lasting relationship.

We are both intelligent, articulate people, active and involved, socially and politically liberal, and financially stable. We're still healthy, energetic, and attractive, and we intend to keep ourselves that way for many years to come.

Here are some specifics about me:

I am HWP (5'4"" tall, ~137 lbs.) and Caucasian. Raised east-coast Jewish, for the past two decades I have been an active member of a progressive religious community that includes people of all persuasions. I am omnivorous, and get along best with those similarly inclined. Semi-retired now, I continue to seek ways to contribute my experience and energy to people and projects that make a difference in the world. Among the pastimes I enjoy are music and dancing, puzzles, cooking and savoring good food and beverage, hiking and exploring (especially with my canine companion), flowers and plants, computers and the Internet, movies and some TV, home maintenance and renovation. My social and political leanings are decidedly liberal/progressive.

If you resonate with this post, I hope you'll write to tell me about yourself (age and location are essential!), what you're looking for, why you're responding. When you do, please attach a current photo; I will happily reciprocate if we seem to be a match.

I'm looking for someone to keep me company when I go for my early morning (5am) jogs. I'm trying to lose some weight and I hear my area isn't the safest so an extra person will be appreciated! Don't want it to be a reason not to get fit again.

I am looking to meet someone who is intelligent and has a deep interest in life. A personal faith in Christ is very important to me and I want to share that with someone. I am looking for a best friend who is passionate, confident about himself, and what he believes in. I am looking for someone who likes music, outdoors, races, bike rallies, and concerts I am sincere in my relationships, loyal and dependable that was the way I was raised, being a gentle lady is simply a matter showing love, adoration, and consideration. I believe in traditional values, but still open minded when it makes sense. Most importantly though, I am a person committed to making my relationship work since we all know it is a matter of give and take. It is not likely for us to find everything we desire in a partner but these are just some of the things I am interested in. So, just like you, I am a lot of things and, if this interests you so far, send me a short email to know more.For fun, I like riding my bike and listening to music (at the same time) while traveling to new places or just going back home to spend time in the country, outdoors. I enjoy concerts, games, bike rallies, movies, roller coasters, and road trips to anywhere (especially somewhere I have not been yet).

I am a mature woman who knows what she want's and deserves. I've given up on thinking that my knight and shining Armour will be here to rescue me. I've come to the conclusion that only by seeking will I find you. Your a proud and somewhat arrogant man. Your deep voice echo's in my heart and mind and when your near my heart beats like crazy. Your mischievous smile captivates my mind and soul especially when you smile at me. That look you give me when I'm going to be yours just makes me heat up and want you so bad. Needing you is exhausting, but you enjoy watching me be independent. Conversation, communication, banter and laughter is essential in our lives and you do it so well. I rest my head on your chest and hear your heart content and beating like music to my ears. We've developed this conversation with our bodies that requires no words. I love that you will text me in the morning or middle of the day to remind me that your thinking of us. I love it even more when you surprise me. You have not forgotten date night, nor a special event. When you call me baby and ask me to dry you off when you get out of the shower, well it's all prelude to our love making. You drive me crazy when you wake me in the middle of the morning wanting me. Have I told you lately just how much I worship you. Don't worry, Ill show you.
Don't bother if your married, not looking for a fling or one night stand. Not interested in players. Be real, and the best rewards are given in life for those that wait and play it right. Only then will my heart mend.

Someone that has strong positive values, can communicate effectively, has a zest for life, and overall, a good natured individual . 

I'm a big kid at heart, but can be serious when I need to be. I'm not a workaholic, but prefer to stop and smell the roses often. I enjoy home life as much as I enjoy being out in nature. Please be somewhat active. If you consider yourself a couch potato, hmmmm, we would not be a great fit. 

I enjoy traveling , camping, hiking, music, the Arts and exploring this beautiful state we live in. Generally, I'm a happy and blessed individual . I'm easy to get along with and prefer a drama/stress free life style as much as possible. I prefer to make love, not war. I never go to bed angry. I prefer to address issues, find a solution(agree to disagree too) and move on. I'm affectionate, sensual, loyal and monogamous. Please be between ages 30 - 42.

Hello There ~ Happy Monday!

I'm a 35y/o SBF who is hoping to make a new friend and see where things go from there. I'm mature, intelligent, outgoing, loyal, honest, and most importantly... funny! Im looking for someone with similar characteristics who can possibly one day become my ultimate lover, friend, & business partner all rolled into one.

If you are into super skinny women you should probably stop reading now . I played alot of competitive sports growing up so I have an athleTHICK build as I was told once... lol I am also 5 feet even and a great representation of the fact the good things come in small packages.

I love to cook, travel, attend pro sporting events, carnivals, concerts, museums, etc. I've played pretty much any sport you can think of so I love to be active. I also play a couple instruments so I have an appreciation for all kinds of music.

I'm also trying to find a co-ed softball league to join , so if you happen to know of one in the area please let me know :)

I am far from superficial or high maintenance. I like to dress nice, but I am just as comfortable in jeans and a T-shirt.

I adore children, but don't have any of my own yet, so I am very open to dating someone who does, but no BMD (yes, Baby Mama Drama) please :)

I'm definitely romantic, but not too mushy. I love to spoil my man & I love to be spoiled. I believe that building a solid relationship takes time and I'm not afraid to go the extra mile to show my man that I care.

Race is not an issue for me. All I ask is that you be honest, sincere, and DRAMA FREE - no game-players here!

If I haven't scared you off yet, feel free to send me a reply (with a pic if you can). Tell me some interesting things about yourself aside from the standard bio info please. One-Liner responses will be deleted. I will send a recent pic with my initial response once I'm satisfied you are real.

First things first: I have herpes. I am NOT looking for casual sex and am only saying this up front to screen out anyone that has a problem with it. I contracted herpes (aka HSV) the first time I had sex so my ENTIRE sexual life has consisted of me establishing a trusting relationship first, having the ""talk"", and then intimacy. I don't know how to approach sex any other way and I don't want to. If you are interested only in sex, I'm probably not a good match. 

I am a mix of white/Asian. I am in my late 30's but am often told that I look much younger. I wear a size 8 (or medium) in women's clothing and am curvy (big breasts/hips) but not fat but not skinny either. I guess I consider myself hwp. I am financially successful and have great friends. I am active and work out regularly. 

I smile and laugh a lot and tend to be optimistic, encouraging and nurturing. I am kind, genuinely care about others, and am sometimes too trusting. People who don't know me well tend to think I'm bubbly and carefree while those close to me would describe me as being driven and accomplished. People also mistake me for being extraverted (I am often described as ""fun"" or ""sociable"") but I'm actually an introvert and like my downtime. I tend to be slow at establishing sexual intimacy. I am normally abstinent for long periods of time in between boyfriends and move slowly towards sexual intimacy in new relationships. Once I am in a sexual relationship though, I tend to have a high sex drive, am very open about my desires and my body (only with my lover, though, since I am not interested in having multiple partners), and enjoy experimentation. So please be gentlemanly enough to respect my limits (especially at the beginning of the relationship) but naughty enough to push them a bit later. 

Except for the guy who gave me herpes and maybe a couple of other experiences, I have had mostly great experiences with men so I don't have that sort of baggage. Most of my exes were also my best friends and continued to respect and care for me long after the relationship was over. I am honest, loyal and have never cheated on anyone so you will not have to worry about those kinds of issues with me. I do, however, have issues with relying on others. I've been self-reliant and fiercely independent for most of my life and have a tendency to close myself off and hunker down on my goals when I face a problem. But I'm older now and am rethinking my priorities and have decided that I want to go about things a little differently. I want a partner in life -- someone that I can face life's challenges with together -- and I now know that the only way I can find a partner is by allowing some to be a partner. So please be honest, trustworthy, responsible, dependable and reliable since I won't allow myself to be with anything less. I promise to be the same in return.

I think I said enough about myself for now. If I interest you and you think you might be what I'm looking for, then please write. Please be in your 30's/early 40's. I will not respond to spam, one-liners, men who obviously didn't read my ad or responses where I sense deception.

A little bit about me. I'd like to think I'm low-key, low maintenance date. I'm very easy going with a great personality, and I love to laugh. I'm a little chubby, about a size 16 dress. I'm a bit short, barely over 5'.

I don't need a dinner at the French Laundry and a trip to Bora Bora every week to make me happy (Although, if you do offer me a trip to Bora Bora I most likely will not turn you down). Honestly, I've been meaning to go out for Laser tag, and would enjoy going with someone. Local day trips, walks/hikes, things to do on the weekend are among the things I like. I will admit to singing in the car and shower, and I like to enjoy all of the little things in life.

I'd like someone who I can go on dates with as well as have a great night in. I prefer a cozy night in cuddling watching Netflix as opposed to the bar scene. I want to find someone who I'm comfortable with doing something and doing nothing with. I love messaging and/or calling periodically throughout the day. I don't need to spend every waking moment in communication with you, but a little bit of texting and a call or two wouldn't hurt. I like hearing from my partner.

I need someone who understands that I'm not going to jump into bed on the first date with. If I wanted a quick lay, I'd be posting in the casual encounters section. I don't need more drama in my life, so please... But don't take that as I never want to talk with you; I really do enjoy conversation. I'd just prefer if I didn't have any of your friends or exes or family trying to blow me up or kill me for whatever god knows reason when I haven't done anything wrong. I like myself intact, in one piece, and uninjured thanks. :) I'd really like to keep it that way.

If you'd like to know more about me, just ask!

If you respond, please, tell me a little bit about yourself. I put thought and effort into this, so I'd like to hear about you. And a picture wouldn't hurt.

Thanks for reading :)

Hey, 

I'm really just looking for some new friends, seeing who's out there, and hoping to actually meet and build something here.
I'm employed full-time in the East Bay, but love getting out to the city when I get the chance. I love sports, and follow the SF Giants pretty religiously. Music is my bliss, I sing and drum on a regular basis. I try to stay healthy, and don't smoke, drink or do drugs. 
Maybe we can grab some boba if we meet up. 
Anyhow, don't want to say too much, but looking to connect with some good, open-minded, liberal people with a good head on their shoulders. 
I'm open to connecting with people younger or slightly older. 
Shoot me an email if you think we'd connect. Thanks.

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, in which city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

Well this is new....i have never posted on CL before but after trying the bar scene and even using dating website, I thought...what the hell!

Simply put, I'm looking for someone who has their shit together! someone who knows who they are, knows what they like, what they don't like, and who is in the mind set to be in a relationship. Sense of humor is everything in my book, if you can make me smile or laugh the better! Someone who loves sports is a plus because trust and believe I will ditch you to watch a baseball or basketball game. 

A little about me, I'm quick-witted, sarcastic, a bit of a tomboy (but i can clean up when needed), and spontaneous. Don't expect a supermodel, there's a bit more to love with in body type but It doesn't stop me from hiking, going to the gym, or eating healthy. I'm as laid back as they come and probably one of the most non judgmental people that I know. I love my career and I have invested a lot of time and energy into my education to be where I am now.

Your description of yourself should be similar to mine.

Still there? Then please write to tell me about yourself and why you're responding. Your response should include your age, location, and photo(s), but if that's all you include, you will not be of interest to me. (If we seem to be a match, I will of course reciprocate.)

OK, so Craigslist might not the first place that comes to mind to meet a ""normal guy"" when it comes to having an LTR, but a colleague met her now spouse this way years ago, so I figured, let's see what the proverbial storms may bring in this rainy day.

About Me: 
I'm a SWF cute brunette who stands tall at 5'2"". 
I'm a city girl who lives and works in San Francisco (have called the Mission home for the past 12 years) but originally from Chicago, so you could say I have good ol' fashioned midwestern values. 
I stay active going to the gym, yoga, biking, and taking my dog on ""urban hikes."" 
I like to check out new restaurants, cook, see live music at venues like The Independent and Fillmore and global travel adventures (most recently to Cuba). 
I'm not a drama queen and have little tolerance for it.

About You: 
Straight, single male, in your 40s, fit and attractive (you don't need to be Greek god, but you're no slouch either), mentally stable, emotionally mature and financially independent. 
Your sense of humor is more of the dry and sarcastic variety, rather than slapstick. 
You're smart and engaged with what's going on in our world. 
You're honest and loyal. 
You value your family and friends. 
You live or work in San Francisco (I'm not into long distance dating and would consider San Jose to be long distance). 
Bonus points if you're a dog-person. 
You're ultimately looking for a LTR but willing to give this Craigslist thing a shot and take one step at a time to see where it may lead you.

I'm not one for endless back and forth emails/texts, as I'd much rather meet up for a drink or coffee to see if there's a connection. But first things first, send me a note with a pic and do tell me a little more info about yourself, and we can take it from there.

Hey everyone,
So how should I start?
I'm looking to find someone to date, taking it slow but to then hopefully turn into an LTR if we both feel a mutual feeling. I am NOT looking for a one night or fwb. I'm not that type at all.
With that said, I'm a cute Asian female, 5'1, about 105lbs. I would say I'm a pretty caring person. I'm always trying to be there for everyone. I'm a pretty observant person especially with my surrounding. 
I guess the main reason I considered writing on here was because I don't go out too much to meet new people. I'm usually at work, with family, working out, or sometimes out with my friends. 

I'm looking for someone who's 33 to 39 years to see how things go. Take it slow and see where it goes? The way I see it the worst possible outcome is I end up with another friend. Lol looking for someone with goals, and positive energy. Someone who's understanding, honest, and obviously mature.
Is this you? Then email me.
Subject line your favorite movie
Also a description about you.
Until next time :)

Hello,

I'm looking for a good guy; someone who's a gentleman, knows how to treat a lady and is ready for a long term relationship. I'm a spiritual woman who enjoys the outdoors, music, travel, romance and meaningful conversation. I'm a strong and opinionated person who works hard but still makes time to be still. I adore men who are honest, kind, gentle, quirky, educated, committed to making the world a better place, easy going,faithful,old fashioned manners, respectful, mature and wants to take their time and get to know me. Also, someone who is financially stable (as I am) with a Monday through Friday schedule so we can enjoy weekend getaways and a comfortable lifestyle. My stats: 52 years old, 5'8, 195lbs, and cute as a button. You: all of the above; 45-55 years old, tall, handsome and a great smile. Please send a picture with your reply.

I am an educated woman who is about to experience the best part of her life: traveling, listening to music and dining with family and friends are some of my interests. I am an avid Warriors fan - if you like the Warriors - it is a HUGE plus!! I also like football -- not sure about the 49ers though.

I am feeling very optimistic about this new phase of my life. I am working as an IT Project Manager at a Biotech company in San Francisco. I finally can have the work/life balance I wanted my whole life. 

If you don't have time for dating, please don't respond. I have met a few men who work all the time and just don't make time to enjoy themselves. Now is the time!

I love live music: jazz, blues, reggae, rock, R&B, symphony, and most live music events. I try to attend one live music event each month.

I spend my spare time in the garden, cooking, walking my two dogs, spending time with family and friends. 

I enjoy men who are intelligent with a great smile and dark skin. Sense of humor is a must. Overall I am a positive, energetic, adventurous, interesting, fun loving person who loves to snuggle. If my profile piques your interest -- please send me an email with your picture. . ..you never know who you will meet online!

Good luck on your quest!!

I could have cared less what you thought about me.Then you started to get friendly with me. I still managed to resist you. After a while there became this greater awareness of you and your frequent proximity to me. And the times when I catch you looking at me, I just know. It's not the way my other guy friends look at me. But alas, you have a gf, which makes whatever this is between us, unfair to both of us. I want all of you or none of you, which is why I try to minimize my contact with you. But I don't get to decide that. I am stuck with you in my life for a while. I hope this doesn't hurt too much.

Hi there! I'm an Asian American woman who is looking for a fun, casual FWB type of relationship. I am not looking for anything serious, but I would prefer something ongoing. It's always great to get along with people, but my main concern these days is the physical attraction and chemistry. 

I am 26, 5'7"", slim, clean/disease-free, and single. I enjoy working out and being active as much as I like to lie in bed watching TV. Hopefully you are tall (around 6 feet), athletic/fit, good looking, single, between the ages of 23 and 35, and also clean/disease-free and get checked for STDs regularly. Being respectful and a great kisser are absolute musts. I am open to all races, though I will say that I tend to prefer East Asian guys. 

If you fit my description and are looking for something similar, feel free to send me a message! Please include a picture with your face and a brief description of yourself/some indication that you actually read my ad. No picture, no reply. Your picture will get mine. Thanks!

People say they first notice my bright smile, friendly personality, and they say that I'm easy to talk too. I'm a good listener and will only give advice when asked. I've got a good sense of humor and love to laugh - but always in good taste. I'm a straight-shooter and as genuine and sincere as they come. I'm laid back and down to earth but I get very passionate over various topics. I work with kids, I love what I do, and I'm really good at it. I put my heart and soul into everything that I do. Living a active, healthy lifestyle is paramount to me - I'm not good for anybody, let alone myself, if I don't take good care of my mind, heart, and body. I'm detailed, organized, and admittedly ""slightly"" OCD... but just on some things ;-)

I consider myself to be a modern woman who enjoys the freedom and independence that a good job provides but I'm also old-fashioned in my desire to find a clean-cut man with similar beliefs and character qualities that make him stand out as a strong, humble leader who's confident in who he is, where he came from, and passionate about where he's going in life and he'd like nothing more than for us to join forces together as a team. I'm hoping to find that rare honorable gentleman who is wise, kind, caring, thoughtful, selfless, loyal, generously affectionate and totally over the moon about me - and me for him. I want us both to encourage, build up, and challenge one another to learn and grow and even call each other out (in love) when necessary. I want us to rejoice in each other's strengths and lend a helping hand in each other's weaknesses.

My ideal match would be a healthy, physically fit Caucasian, 6' to 6'2"" with strong broad shoulders and a manly frame that compliments my strong, curvy frame. He'd be between 35-47 have his life in order and not be given over to any vices; single, divorced, or widowed; no kids or share 50/50 custody with his amicable ex. He'll live local to Marin and his heart is open, ready, and willing to put quality time and effort into finding his best friend, future lover, and life-long companion in me :-)

Do you like to camp, go fishing, do yard work, build hot rods? So do I. This may not be the best place to look, but lately no matter were the looking has been it seems there are a bunch of fake ass men who just want to text only and send pictures of their junk.. I could care less what it looks like.

What i care about is a conection, one that will hopefully last a very long time.. and trust me if there is a connection there will be lots of time for me to see feel and play with everything. I want a man who is strong and confident, with a good sense of humor. Looks are important but if we can talk first and have a connection and laughter looks dont always matter.. As the saying goes love is blind. 

I dont care what you have or dont have if you have kids or not (i dont) as long as your honest.. And unattatched is a must!!!!! I am 48 average build, not smokin hot but not ugly.

age: 22

I keep meeting seemingly interesting and like minded people from here but they all have one very annoying thing in common, their jobs rule their lives. I'm a workaholic as much as the next person and considering the area we live in, I don't expect anything less. The thing that sets me apart is that I still choose to make time for a social life and make time for my friends and the person I might be interested in. Before you chose to respond to my ad, please ask yourself if you have atleast 1-2 days a week to hang out and have fun. I'm sick of giving people attention that have intention of returning the same. I'm not clingy and very much so independent but if i put in the effort, I'm expecting the same. 

I'm a noise junkie and spend a lot of time at shows. I love everything from house to dnb. Serious bonus points if you dig electronic music. I could talk for days about music. Also like my fair share of punk, trip hop, hip hop and weird indescribable ambiant music :p 

I like riding bikes and taking random drives late at night. I live for summers when i'm festival hopping with my friends. Plants make me happy. My hair is purple :) I really just wanna meet someone with good intentions and lots on their mind. 

Please only respond if you think we will actually have stuff in common. I usually only end up meeting 1-2 people from about 100 responses. Due to the nature of my work, meeting people in day to day life is a little hard. Especially since i'm not originally from here and didnt know any one when i first moved here.

Tall, warm, classy, caring, sincere, and intelligent.
I believe in every living legend who dedicates their lives to help others to succeed including local military and fire personnel!

My philosophy is to live, and love life to the fullest ,and I never let the little stumbling blocks hold me back.

My mission is something long term, that turns into something real and true. I'd like to start off as friends, and let it progress from there, and meet someone 5-10 or taller.

Some of the things I like are: karaoke, dinning out, sporting events, concerts, baseball, football, dancing, reading the bible, and long walks on the beach in the moonlight.

My ideal date is sharing champagne with cheese and pate talking about philosophy, work, and our lives.
I like to laugh and have fun. But I also work really hard to enjoy what the Bay Area has to offer. I like it when a man makes an effort with button up shirts and nice dinner jackets. I'm eventually looking for a commitment and not looking for a casual encounter. I love romance and want to believe again. I'm an ENFJ if that means anything to you. I have eclectic interests ranging from corporate strategy, chess, existentialist/post-structuralist thought, new restaurants, exploring the Bay, and hosting dinner parties. So I need someone who is authentic and intellectually curious that loves food.

Please don't be married, recently divorced, or cheating on your partner.

I don't have an age preference.

ISO a Mistress? I'm cute, Asian and petite.

I'm looking for something unconventional. I can be affectionate and playful with the right incentives. Think back to a time you first learned how to date. What would you do? 

You be attentive and thoughtful. If you succeed in making me feel special then I'll make sure I take care of you. 
I'm not looking to change your life. Just enhance it a bit. 

Im not the needy type, but if you want that we can work something out. 
You must be in good shape, able to host. 
I am std/dd free and you must be too.

A little about me... 
I'm a very positive and optimistic girl. I have a passion for life and love to live. Life is too short and I think it's time for me to experience all that it has to offer. I love to laugh and have a great personality. I'm the girl that will laugh out loud about something funny I heard yesterday. I enjoy reading, cooking (now where is that take out menu?), sports (basketball, football, baseball, etc). I'm a thick chick (5'4, busty, size 14) so you must enjoy girls with meat on their bones. I enjoy getting lost in a good book/movie, especially if it's a horror flick. I still get dressed up for Halloween and decorate my house for the holidays. As for my career, I'm a Technical Recruiter and have been very successful in that field but it's not my passion. I've gone back to school because when I grow up I want to be a Clinical/Forensic Psychologist. :) Race is unimportant to me but a good sense of humor is. 

What I'm looking for in a partner? 
Because I love to laugh, a man that is funny works well for me. I also have a thing for assertive men. I like a strong personality, a man that knows what he wants and isn't afraid to go out and get it. Someone that doesn't need a relationship but wants one. Someone who is complete but would like a happy addition to his life. I'm not a smoker and don't do drugs so I'm not into someone that does either. Social drinking is fine. As far as age, I guess someone that's 35+. 

I'd just like to add... 
I love all types of music. I just recently got into country music. 95.7 The Wolf is one of my favorite stations. I also enjoy jazz, blues, rock (foo fighters are my favorite), and many, many others. I visited Mexico a couple of years back and am looking forward to going again. Traveling to different parts of the world is something I enjoy. I'm a huge horror movie buff but can enjoy a good action or drama flick. Of course comedy is right up there as well. Car shows are fun as well as museums. I have no problem getting dirty and I clean up rather nicely. My food choices range from mexican food, Indian, Thai, Japanese, down to good old meat and potatoes. 

If I seem at all interesting to you then shoot a meesage over to me and lets see where it leads.

I have pics to share and will once I know you're not a bot.

I'm hoping that I will be proven wrong - I'm not expecting much from this posting. You never know unless you try.

I'm looking to settle down with that special someone. I know that no one is perfect, but here are the qualities that I'm looking for in someone - sincere, kind hearted, caring, fantastic listener, helpful, family oriented.

The person I'm looking for possibly wants to start a family and wants to settle down. He doesn't play games. He is mature and not self centered.

I'm easy going and down to earth. It can be difficult for me to open up to others, but once they've gained my trust, then I'm more open.

I'm a nice and kind person. I'm looking for the same.

I am mostly attracted to white males, but am open to any ethnicity.

I'm looking to date guys who are around my age only - not anyone younger or much older than me. 35-38

If any of this has sparked your interest, let's start talking.

Serious about my preferences, and that does include age.

Latina, 41 in search of my Super Nerdy (White) Hero.

The things I would like out of this special friendship are, someone that I can connect with physically as well as intellectually. Someone I can have deep meaningful conversations to the lightest with! :) Someone to laugh and cry with. Share everything and anything, at full trust! Our secrets and only ours! Like special friends, soul mates... We can hangout, go out for lunch or dinner, have picnics, go for walks, hikes, travel/seek adventure, people watch, go to movies, or stay in, cook for each other, or together, teach me how to play videos games if you are a gamer?? =D haha. Put a flower in your head..or two! :) Be silly or cheesy together... cuddle, love each other. Simply just be together whenever we feel like, whenever life allows us to. I would like to find someone that I can care for and love, and in return do the the same for me. My heart is big and I would like to share it with someone special. It can be whatever we want it to be, as long as it is something meaningful.

I have been described by men as beautiful, cute, sexy, fun, funny, sweet and caring. To describe myself, I am caring, compassionate, passionate, hopeless romantic, sentimental, silly at times, but know when to be serious. I am a strong woman who can be vulnerable at times and I am not ashamed to say so. I have my flaws and I am very aware of them. They have helped me to learn and grow, better myself. They have made me the strong woman I am today, more and more each day. I am, simply put, a bubbly introvert.

I am attracted to younger men and they have always been attracted to me. We have always felt comfortable with each other, a special connection. I have been told I make them feel free, unleashed! And I too have always felt the same.

My preference is between the ages of mid 30's to early 40's. I am attracted to slender build (average, depending on what you define average as. Haha), shy, introverted (I find this trait rather sweet, cute, attractive!), white/Caucasian guys, fair skinned with light eyes. Green, blue... No tattoos (well actually...It depends. How big are we talking and how many??). I am sorry, but it's what I like, and I have a right to my preference. It is what it is! As you have a right to yours!

Good looking smart artistic black man/woman WANTED

I am on a mission to find my unicorn. I know, it will be very unlikely you match all these qualities, but if you can come close hopefully we can have a good connection- (before you read further, I do not want to have anymore kids, so if you are not already a parent or still want kids, or don't know for sure yet, please don't reply) 



First let's start with me-



Short, cute with dimples, nice smile, 36D, cute feet, big booty but not perfect Kim lol, I am a thick girl, some days thicker then other days but not a bbw, I have two grown kids, I'm funny, giggler, artistic, techie, news and politics lover, love fishing, camping, 420 card holder, filmmaking, photography and much much more



Now the hard part... What I am looking for in a person-



I prefer black men/woman (don't hate and send hater mail just cause your not the one lol) yes I am bi but I am a one at a time and that doesn't mean automatic threesome sorry guys. I want to be with ONLY one man or ONE woman the rest can be discussed in the far future. So with that said, cheaters, players, gamers, Liers and sports heads can move on. Lol



In a man or a woman- great smile, smiles often, great sense of humor sarcastic preferred, can be aggressive and submissive in the bedroom and less aggressive in person, I am a strong leader type but need someone that can also take control.. I like 100/100 In a relationship all the way around.. So if you are too much on either direction we probably won't get along, like if you are too weak or too strong minded, and same with your soul. I prefer spiritual people that believe in God but not religion. If your voting for trump, move on. 



I want someone that cares about meaningful conversations, adventures and amazing sex. 

Prefer an artistic type but would love to find both artistic and techie so left and right brain people like me but not someone that thinks they know everything and isn't still learning. Non judgemental types, I smoke a lot of weed so you have to be ok with that and if you are also a weed smoker, you must be a business handling type.. 

With that said, I am a very busy person but will make time and hope you can do the same if you enjoy some of what I do listed above that's a bonus. 



Now for the details lol



I like..

Men- tall, cute, stamina, strong, but teddy bears on the inside who like extra strong on the outside woman. 



Woman- short, cute, more feminine looking but androgynous attitude like me is best fit, booty, sorry I like it lol, I don't mind bigger girls but I like hour glass bigger, so hips is a plus :) keeping it real lol 



Sum for both sexes- nice smile and funny sarcasm preferred, artistic, smart, sexual, and adventurous, hopefully you don't live too far from me, being so busy, the closer to concord the better but a match is a match hehe



I know, I might be asking for too much but hey! They say if you it it out to the universe it shall come, it's out there lol



PLEASE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING or I most likely won't reply... 



Clear pix or two, age, location, do you have kids, if they stay with you, and a little about you 😘

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, in which city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

Hi-
I hate to start off with I've never tried this before' but I haven't. I've answered a few ads and I've browsed. Now it's time to post. 

Who I am: a fairly successful lady. I'm sane, smart and often playful. I enjoy cocktails, delicious food, chatting about current events, strolling the city and planning road trips. I read, books (crazy right) and I also binge watch netflix sometimes, because WHY NOT! 

What I'm looking for: a passionate friendship. Nothing more than that to start. I would like to find someone to be excited to spend time with, who I can't wait to hear from and who is going to make me smile. It's also important that you have an open mind and not take yourself too seriously. 

Who I'm looking for: This is the tricky part right? Let's not put a tight box on this. I'm only looking for one nice man, I'm not a fan of the juggle. Too stressful. I like men my age or a little younger, I'm 44 and typically date men of about 38-52, this is just a general range but ideally be full of life experience. I like wisdom, great tales of grandeur and confidence. Very attracted to men taller than me. Make sure you can enjoy playful conversation, friendly debates and silly jokes. Be ready to laugh and have a good time, and be yourself. 

I work a flexible full time Monday through Friday. I just want to see who's out there. Maybe find someone to share a few experiences and smiles with. 

I'm attractive (been told), a youthful face not super skinny just average athletic type. Let's email a bit and we'll discuss trading photos, but more likely we'll just meet because you're looking for experience not a pen pal right? I have all of my teeth, my own place to live and not looking for a husband or babies. 

If you think that's you. Respond. 

Just so you know, I'll probably want to email a bit - and then I will likely suggest coffee or a walk to chat and feel things out.

Thanks and hope to hear from you.

Hi. This post is a bit dry and humorless. Seems like I need a bit of fun, excitement, cheering up. Attending arts events and doing girl stuff isn't enough. I can't sleep and the rain makes me long for intimacy with a man. I'm feeling rather hopeless about ever meeting a sexy, lovely single man again.

I'm a genuine woman living in San Francisco. I work from home, and I live with my best friend. I have a small dog. I have more free time than the average adult, but I also require a lot of alone time. I know how to take care of myself, and most of my needs are already met. I am educated, spiritually awake, kind, and pleasant. I've been single for nearly six months, and dating hasn't appealed to me much because I can't tolerate disrespect and objectification. I'm not sure how to overcome this problem.

I'm generally considered to be beautiful, but also overweight. I have a very curvy pear shaped body type, plus a large bust. Fair skinned with dark hair and very feminine. It seems for whatever reason that men can only see me as a sexual object. Perhaps it is my hip-to-waist ratio, my abundant curves, or the fact of my childhood sexual abuse. Maybe I'm just sexy. Maybe because I'm a larger woman, men assume I'm easy or have low self-esteem. Maybe it's all of these things. I just can't seem to find men who can talk to me like a human being, but are also interested in me.

I need to find any man I date sexually attractive. Men seem to forget this part. I'm attracted to youthful, good looking men. Intelligent, well spoken, masculine, single, in San Francisco. Able to have ladies over to your home.

I have photos. Please send photos in your response. Otherwise it is a waste of time, don't bother.

I have really bad scars from an accident I had as a child. **The photo is a picture of an ex model turned burnsurvivor named Turia Pitt. ** I read about her story and how her relationship was able to pull through the trauma of her accident. Although it's a bit of a reach for me, I am hopeful that despite the absence of the right guy, its possible for me too. 

So coupled with the outcome of my injury and growing up in a conservative household, I consider myself a bit of a late bloomer. The scars on my face are my biggest regret because as you can imagine people's stares aren't always kind. So in anticipation of eye contact, I tend to look away. Trust me, I'm working on it and it's getting better with time. 

My personality is adaptable. In many instances like work and school, I'm a social butterfly and a relatively confident person. But when it comes to social environments where I'm meeting people who aren't familiar with me and especially where dating or flirting happens, I tend to flounder and not know what to do... While this seems like a venting session, I'd like to hope there's someone who's out there who can relate and or want to get to know me, despite the obvious challenges I'm getting over.

I have made some strides in the dating area, I guess. The other day I met someone I was chatting with from tinder and it went fine. We met once after a few days and then another time after a few weeks of talking. I just don't think it's going anywhere because subtle things indicated that he didn't respect me or my time... I'll leave it at that. But for some reason a few days after the second meet up we just stopped checking in. Despite that upset, I did learn through that experience that in spite of feeling singled out and unlovable; I realized how many, if not all people sometimes feel that way. 

Simply put by a bar buddy I met at the Continental Dinner while waiting forty-five minutes for my date to arrive (oops, I said I wouldn't get into that), the buddy said we all have scars and experience trauma. Its just that some of your scars show on the outside. As simple and obvious as that may seem, it meant the world to me to feel that even for a second, I wasn't as different as my appearance and interactions lead me to sometimes feel and believe. Needless to say, I'm working on myself but am certainly not a push over (so you preying wolf, stay away!) 

If you're interested in getting to know someone like myself and maybe hangout, shoot me a message by telling me about yourself and attach a picture of yourself. Here's some of the things I hope you're like:

Friendly, Respectful
Single, No kids, Never married
Educated, Employed, Ambitious

Originally from Europe. I live now for many years here in the USA, and like it very much! So how can I describe myself? First, I am real, do not play games (so I love scrabble besides other games), am centered, funny and can be goofy at times, choose to see life from a positive view, have a zest for life and love it! Love the outdoors, am ecologically very aware, more on the liberal side.
I am a very friendly, passionate and romantic, calm, warm hearted, caring, intelligent, very educated, open minded, energetic, very active and creative. 

Am more softspoken, sensitive yet strong, and seek my partner, best friend and soulmate. Some of the qualities I seek in my partner are kindness, compassion, is passionate, sensual, very affectionate and romantic. ""walks his talk', knows what he wants, can communicate his feelings and also has some form of spiritual practice.

I have many interests, some of them are: reading, literature, arts, music, going to bookstores where I can get lost at times, creative projects, cooking, theater, writing, and much more. I dont like to be around angry or negative people, dislike drama, life is too short for that. I see the glass half full, like to focus on the good in life by choice. I am interested in spirituality, consciousness studies, mysticism, philosophy, environmental issues, Ayurvedic medicine, mediation, yoga, tantra (tantric spirituality and philosophy, and yes its more than just sex!), and am learning more about it. 

When you write back to me let me know how to get in contact with you (by email), am sincere in my search and a picture is greatly appreciated! I am looking forward to hear back from you, and the best of luck on your search

Filipina, hoping to find a long term relationship with a man who knows what he wants out of life and a man who has a good head on his shoulder.

So I'm very stoned and I feel the need to shake things up. The rainy weather is dreary and girls just want to have fun!

You are a very attractive single kind man who has experience with ladies and can even have them over to your place. Your place is in or near to San Francisco, because that's where I am mostly always. I don't go that far because, you know, I love it here and lazy.

I am a silly girl sometimes who laughs often and being a fat extra T&A curvy BBW type, I jiggle when I laugh. Some men love that about me and some men want hardbody type ladies and that's totally cool but not me, not at all. So if jiggly laughter is your style, yay!

I can be mellow too, especially when I'm stoned and I really miss hanging out and talking and making out since I've been single. It's hard to meet kind funny men who are sexy, especially when you mostly socialize and work with all gay men and women. I love my life but I don't really meet many red hot blooded heterosexual men types except maybe in highly transient situations like public transit or lyft line or walking down the street.

So I feel like there has to be at least one man like this in or near San Francisco who will respond to this post with a recent cute photo of himself and a blurb that seems relevant and then I can send him a photo, and maybe more exchanges and then maybe we can meet up like at a bar or something like that, and then maybe if we like each other we can like, get to know each other and maybe laugh and maybe make out. I know this whole scenario seems super challenging, but who knows. It could happen.

It sure would be nice to meet that someone, maybe someone that's just fun to hang out with, maybe more. I don't have to have someone in my life, it's not a need or a want, but like to have or would be nice to.

I'm established, self sufficient, successful in my own right. Thought to be intelligent, smart, funny, easy going. A left brain person with some right brain tendencies. Men interested in me have said I'm pretty, attractive, beautiful even - it's definitely in the eye of the beholder, and I'm on the exotic side. The people who have been drawn to me, tend to like the combination of smarts, wit, charm, confidence and the dazzling smile. :-)

I am relatively fit, spend a fair amount of time at the gym, better than average but definitely not thin or athletic. I look for the same.

I find great chemistry between men who are wicked smart, humble, grounded, calm, funny, have a quiet confidence, charming, extroverted geek/nerd types and it isn't until one nerd's out that they start showing it. Have their life together and remain young at heart. I don't know why it is but the above traits seem to go with jeans and t-shirt types, tech or creative types.

I'm uncomplicated, keep drama on the other side of the moat and I like it that way. So if you're prone to either, there are plenty of others who dig that sort of thing.

If you are inclined to respond, please share enough about yourself so that I can get some sense of who you are.

Deal breakers - drugs, smoking, being married, bad temperament, outside of 40-50 age range, moody etc...

Physically, I am of average height and weight (5'4""/~138 lbs.), and considered pretty/attractive...but attraction is personal. While I appreciate lifestyle differences, I'm best matched with a man who -- like me -- is Caucasian, monogamous, and omnivorous. I am interested only in men who are legally and emotionally available -- i.e., single, divorced, or widowed, and not currently partnered.

It's the time of renewal, time for making new friends, time to do things differently. A new path.

I have a resolution: to find and choose a nice caucasian man, over 40 under 55, single/divorced, hair on head not on his face, communicative, educated and kind. No ego issues, no hot tempers, no children, just humble, loving and a gentleman, hopefully this still exists in men.

I would like to go slow, I like to flirt, I like to kiss when the time is right. I like to do things, go for day trips, go to movies/dinner, nice easy stuff. Not an athletic woman here, no snow skiing, motorcycles and camping.

I am on single, asian, 40's, responsible, financially secure, educated and romantic. I am a Capricorn, determined and practical. We are devoted and deep......physically and emotionally/spiritually.

Looking to meet someone for a potential monogamous ltr., not interested in foreign born as I've been there. Looking for an honest guy with no hidden agendas.

Hi there! I'm just wondering where all the decent non-whacko guys have gone?? I mean, I know this is Craigslist and all, but I seriously am wondering if there are still some chivalrous, kind, and genuine guys out there. I'm really not going to write out a huge list of please have and please have nots like some of the ads on here have. That's great if you're looking for your soulmate, by tomorrow lol, but not for just finding awesome people to hang out with and see where it goes. I'm a fairly laid back California native, and I'm just looking for someone to hang out with that won't be a super stalker or wants to pick out a wedding venue on the 3rd date. I mean, that's like a 6th date conversation, maybe 7th, lol. So kidding ;-) I refuse to believe chivalry is dead and I'm sure there has to be a guy out there who wants to join me on activities similar to these: random adventures into SF, day trips to the beach or lakes/river etc, drinking a little too much wine and watching a funny movie, or just hanging out at home cooking up something amazing for dinner. Good cuddlers and amazing huggers are encouraged to apply :-) I'm the anti-chick in that I'm not looking for something super serious from the first email exchange we will have. I just want to connect with someone and find someone who enjoys my company as much as I enjoy theirs. All I ask is that you are: not a tobacco smoker, not married or otherwise romantically involved, gainfully employed, not looking for a hookup, somewhat around my age (around 24-38 but not super picky about it), taller than me is preferable, not more than 30 min away from Walnut Creek, and real. Please include a pic and change the subject to ""Partner in Crime"" to weed out spam. Please only email if you are really interested in getting to know me and hanging out. Before my first ad got flagged yesterday, I received a bunch of replies but so many people flaked out after the initial email. Anyways, thanks for reading and I hope to hear from you soon!

Nerdy and Sophisticated Gentleman for Spring fun. 

Hi,

I would like to meet a cool companion for spring time outing to explore the Bay Area and cultural outings such as wine tasting in Napa or a round of golf or tennis or sailing.

He is very well-educated, athletic and fit, love of nature and literature, good cooking, play tennis and or golf, fond of classical music and a concert goer in SF.

Having said that, I think meeting a like-minded person and who is within a similar age range would be practical to develop a long term friendship for outdoorsy activities and reading and listening classical music.

I am attracted someone that is intellectual, smart, fit and athletic, enjoys one outdoor sport, classy, and into cultural activities such concerts and stimulating conversation.

To be practical, that someone special is within a similar age range 46-53 y/o, and is currently single.

I'm politically progressive, well-rounded person with diverse interests in performing art and science.
I like someone that is a well-listener and patient and has a professional career with a happy outlook on life. Are you with a lighter baggage that you have more time for the romantic relationship?

The answer is yes, please respond with some introduction about yourself and a recent photo.

Cheers.

I'm 30, cute, curvy, somewhat shy, and tall! I have long wavy brown hair, hazel green eyes, and nice lips, and a cute butt ;) (so I've been told) 

I'm a nurse living in the sf bay area seeking a relationship with a SWM also in the medical field, preferably a doctor (yes I know that sounds cliche...) in the 28-37 age range. You don't have to look like an athlete, but at least be in reasonably good shape (a little chubby is fine, but not fat). I'm not seeking a serious relationship right now, but am looking for friendship and casual dating... possibly fwb. Maybe it will turn into something more, who knows? What I'm NOT interested in is a texting relationship. I actually want to physically meet you in PERSON! A few emails or texts are fine, but I don't want to be your texting buddy. I don't know why, but I've experienced this a lot from guys on dating sites who do this. I want to actully have a cup of coffee with you or go somewhere fun! 

Picture for picture. And please, no dick pictures. I'd like to see your face first. Thanks for reading and hope to hear from you soon! ♡

Hello there gentlemen,

I am a hard working lady who is also a mother to a wonderful son who is just under a year old. And I know what you are thinking/assuming...that I am looking for someone to play daddy for my son. 

I can rest assure you that is not the case, my son has a wonderful dad that is very much involved in his life just didn't work out for us. So why should I stand back and not pursue happiness when I know that it's not only what I deserve but what my son does too. 

I will tell you what I am looking for, I am looking for someone who doesn't want to play games and has a good head on their shoulders but will also understand that my son comes first before anyone. A good sense of humor is a huge bonus ;)

Besides that, I am extremely into music, dance, traveling, and anything that is fun! Don't challenge me to an arcade shooting game unless you want to be impressed ;) haha

Anyways, send me a pic and I'll send one back. Then we shall chat it up and see where it goes from there. I've never tried CL before, so let's see how it goes. 

May the odds be ever in your favor. Ciao!

Looking for depth and honesty...

I am genuine, caring and real. I like doing activities with another person. Let's stay active and explore the bay area together (going to the beach...walking barefoot or some serious hiking, museum/live performance and so on). 

You should have diverse interests and a fan of the great outdoor, generally happy and down to earth:) 

Must be:
single (40-47 only), SAFE & CLEAN (drug/disease free), non-smoker, no body art. Not already in a relationship(s) or getting out of one. 

Only respond if you're looking for the same. I value my time and yours. Friendship with common interests is a good starting point.

Hello,

I am a very passionate person and I'm filled with the joy of life. I'm looking for my best friend and the love of my life to share all the magic and experiences of living. I own my business and I'm semi-retired. I love to travel and explore. I enjoy walking, hiking, jogging, water and the mountains, traveling in the US and in Europe, night life in the cities, most kinds of food, a nice glass of red wine with dinner and exploring.

I am into Spirituality, not religion. I enjoy writing stories and poems, playing with watercolors, and sipping tea/coffee over engaging conversation. I'm fairly close to downtown Los Gatos and would prefer someone in the south bay area or Santa Cruz area. 

What I'm doing with my life 
I live in the Santa Cruz Mountains in a redwood forest and I have a lovely home....with sunshine! It is wonderful up here. I enjoy playing in the mud (gardening) and visiting with my friends the deer. They are cute, especially the babies. I'm having a lot of fun writing a novel. 
I'm really good at 
Communicating with people, having fun and enjoying life. I'm a good listener and I love talking with people. I am a curious person and people are very interesting to me. I also naturally validate people as I notice what people are doing/saying. I do it with sincerity and a loving heart. 

The first things people usually notice about me 
I'm very warm, friendly, and easy to be with. I naturally encourage people. I notice nature and truly appreciate all the beauty that surrounds us. 

Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food 
I'm enjoying reading the work of Colum McCann. I love the poet Rumi, Sci-fi, Scott Orsen Card, books about investing and real estate, and about quantum physics, reading Michio Kaku, Amit Goswami, PhD, a good novel, old classic movies, buttered popcorn and almost all food. 

The six things I could never do without 
Being close, family, love, fun, new experiences and new thoughts, relaxing, being creative, noticing and appreciating nature and the magic of life. Oops more than six. :-) 
I spend a lot of time thinking about 
Being intimate with my beloved, traveling and having adventures. Cuddling, flirting. playing, talking, watching a movie and being together. 

On a typical Friday night I am 
Having dinner and a movie with friends or home watching a movie or reading. 

The most private thing I'm willing to admit 
I hired a handyman to check my mouse trap! 

You should message me if 
You laughed recently and would like to meet for tea/coffee.

Hi.

I'm seeking something a little different. I recently got out of a long-term relationship that ended incredibly badly, and I'm still pretty bruised by it. As much as I can miss big parts of what it was like to be in a relationship, I really need to take some ""me time"" and spend a while recovering. So while I could start dating or find a FWB, I realize that's not really what's best for me right now, even if part of that appeals.

But I miss connection, and I've always been someone who has lived through her words and thoughts pretty intensely. So I thought: maybe I could find an online pen pal -- someone to express my thoughts with, talk about everything from the world around to relationships to sexuality, all while giving myself space to heal, too?

I'm in my early 30s, intelligent, with a good life (outside of relationships), athletic and outdoorsy, good at expressing myself and a loyal friend/partner/whatever. I've primarily dated men, but have been curious about more, so this is a w4w ad, as well as w4m. 

If this sounds like something you might be interested in, let me know. I have no idea what I'll get in response, but I thought I'd try.

Hey guys. 

I dont have a ton of hope that I'll find the guy I'm looking for here on CL. But, stranger things have happened. 
I'm looking to meet a genuine man, with a brain, a sense of humor, a kind spirit, an adventurous soul, and a penchant for Big women. I dont have alot of expectations other then respect and honesty. I'm tired of not having someone to snuggle with, someone to travel with, do fun things with, other then my friends. I want something deeper then casual, but I do understand that its got to start somewhere, and I'm in no rush to get to wherever it is we end up. If you're only looking to get laid, I'm not the girl for you. So please dont waste either of our time. Sex is important to me,but I'm not looking for a friend with benefits thing...I have that if i want it, I dont. So if you're sweet (big plus if you're a sexy geek) and it seems like I could be someone you'd like to get to know, let me know and we'll talk. Your pic, gets mine. tell me about you and what youre looking for. i wont respond to any one line reply, or any without a pic (and dont send a dick pic, seriously) take a second and make a little effort if youre really interested.

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, in which city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

About me: 

Very pretty SWF, size 4, a looker! 
Professional / advanced degrees 
Avid runner 
Yoga practitioner 
Love all things pink and purple 

My smile and eyes are my most prominent and attractive features 
I love the woods 
I love staying up late and seeing the dawn, lazy Sundays in bed with you 

I love to have fun and cut up with someone special - once a special relationship has been established 
Trying to teach myself Italian (slow process) 

A smart, quick thinking man is the ultimate turn-on for me 
I am delightful, delicious, demure, even dainty, subtle, sweet, sexy. 

The type of man I seek: 
I am seeking a successful, confident, and intelligent SWM, 56-72, who knows how to enjoy life. 
A man who will break his routine and try something new, or maybe try something new that he did not enjoy 7 years ago, 
like to learn a new language, a new dance, a new sport (i.e. - cross-country skiing). 

I am seeking a man who is looking for one woman to be his partner - a man who wants a longterm companion to engage in discovery with. 
Prefer a SWM who is well-educated (grad. degrees), sensitive and moved by nature, animals and the arts, a gentleman, kind to everyone 
(including waiters :-), 
successful in his chosen profession and he should still be excited about his professional work. 

Note - a man who dreads his work would not be a good match for me. 

Important - you must be truly single - not separated or married. Age IS important - I look very young - but I am Not attracted to young men. 
I am interested in meeting a SWM between the ages of 56-72. 

An interesting letter and your photo will turn my head and increase the chances that we meet. 
Please respond with a descriptive letter. Picture a Must for a response.

I'm looking to meet a man who is interested in getting to know a woman honestly and respectfully. There is a lot to do and explore in the area, and I find it a lot more fun with a special someone. Physically, I tend to be attracted towards taller, Caucasian men. But other qualities take precedence such as: character, morals, education, drive and success.

About me: mid-twenties, petite brunette. I'm a bit of an old soul and connect best with older, established individuals. But I definitely appreciate those who are open to learning, teaching, and sharing.

Let me know if I've caught your interest by sharing a little bit about what you seek.

An acquaintance tells me that the best way to get over someone is to get under someone else. What do you think - is it true?

My heart is still raw. I long for the touch of a man's large hand, gently brushing my hair out of my face as he caresses my cheek. I so miss soft, fuzzy kisses on my shoulder and neck. I would love to be folded up into strong arms and held close enough to feel another heart beat. I so want to feel safe again, to know that a man has my back and wants to take care of me.

However, I am hesitant, wary, untrusting, and suspicious. I don't want to go thru heartbreak like this again. Is it worth the risk? Does anyone ever fall in love again after 55? Is it even possible to trust someone enough again to be intimate, to trust someone enough to let them into the depths of my body and soul after having been thrown away like a worn out rag?

I'm not looking to be dominated or to be dominant, I don't want to be someone's MILF or cougar, I'm not into threesomes, I'm not polyamorous, I don't want to be your mistress, I'm not looking for a quick lay. It seems that those are most of the desired qualities of men's posts on Craigs.

I am looking for a man who is emotionally available and knows how and when to talk, and who knows how and when to listen. I am looking for someone who doesn't necessarily agree with me on everything, but who can respect that I have my own valid opinions and wants to hear them. I am a giver and a toucher, and I hope to find a man who can handle those qualities and return them in his own authentic way.

If you choose to reply to this post, please be local to the North Bay area, and please don't be offensive or crude - I don't need or want it. Thanks for reading.

While reading this I'd like for you to imagine a curvy short girl with Middle East looks... If you don't dig it you can stop here.
I need to get back on my feet and I've been lonely for way too long. 
My ideal match is...
-Decisive men - Don't ask me what to do...take control 
- Tall (just love tiptoeing to kiss)
- willing to eloap in case love and craziness is mutual. No big wedding, just us singing a paper and singing Johnny Cash in the car while heading to our honey moon.
- must have a hard sex drive (that includes PDA because that turns me )
- must be athletic (I'm curvy by nature but I hit the gym 6x a week and I love going for long walks. trips,
- is SWM ( I have a soft spot for blond guys I must admit) and close to SF preferably within SF or willing to drive 
- available to date me (at least to hang out on weekends) 
- polite to say It was nice to meet you Goodbye in case you don't like me 
Me... I'll always be a traveler and I need someone like that. I don't ask for a rich guy at all and as long as you don't make me pay for the entire tab that's fine. I would work at Chiplote and KFC for a few weeks just so we could have money for a getaway to Alaska. 
And last and most important... Must to be willing to jump with both feet. I understand relationships take time but I take chances on people and hope to find someone who will take a chance on me

It's funny to find you here of all places. Why shouldn't we just be happy with the greatness we have been given? Or maybe it's time to toss it away and be honest.

Grew up in Puerto Rico and the East Village in NYC. Been in the Bay on and off since 2002. Navigating my life towards being a professional performing artist. Have some pretty exciting projects lined up and looking forward to this change in my life. I divide my time between Brooklyn and Berkeley.

Looking to meet someone who openly communicates, is down to earth and really fun! I was told by my best friend that I have a type, which I wasn't aware of but here it is: Passionate, wild bohemian spirited,and die hard romantics who have that skater-Surfer vibe like Anthony Keidis. I also like soft eyes and maturity.
My spirit animal is Alana from Broad City.

I'm Puerto Rican. I'm voluptuous/fat. I'm a feminist. A reader. A writer. A film buff. A comedian. A trained cook. 

I'm pretty shy at first but after getting to know me, I can get outrageous . I really value my relationships with friends and whomever I'm seeing. I'm affectionate, loving,intelligent and driven and seek that in a potential partner.My friends say that I am loyal, loving, supportive, playful, passionate,generous and inappropriately hilarious.

Accomplished, successful, very attractive Black female seeking a male for a serious, long-term, female-led relationship. For clarification, this is not for sexual fetishists or to fulfill someone's fantasy. Although I am a novice to this type of relationship, after much research and review, I have determined that it is the best fit for me. It represents the type of lifestyle that I would like to live with a like-minded individual. That is, I desire a man who receives his pleasure from providing me with love, romance, emotional support and also seeks the level of intimacy and connection that I seek. Basically, he is my best friend and is devoted to me. He is receptive to my leadership and guidance, aware that although he may have input into our decision-making process, the final decision rests with me. Although I expect that we will have a happy and healthy sex life, I would like my partner to be receptive to the possibility of cuckolding. Types of punishment for my partner will be determined jointly as will rewards for his loyalty in ensuring my overall happiness and contentment. I have no interest in BDSM types of punishment(i.e: caning, whipping, slapping, etc.) nor will I dehumanize or demoralize my partner. Ultimately, together we will develop a relationship that works the best for us. Other characteristics that I desire in my partner is that he be between the ages of 37-55, intelligent, educated, successful in his own right and financially stable. He must have an Alpha presentation in the ""outside"" world but be submissive to me in the home. I am also a sapiosexual-I am sexually stimulated by intellect. I believe in full-disclosure; therefore, it is important that any interested parties be aware that I have had HSV Type 2 for 15 years. Because I have behaved responsibly, I have infected no one. I am receptive to any questions or concerns you may have regarding my status.

For those of you who may find this type of relationship and/or my status objectionable or offensive, I ask that you refrain from sending me vulgar and disgusting responses. Just don't respond.

To the individual who has determined that my post required flagging, despite the multitude of dick pics and disgusting requests notorious for this website, I urge you to find another outlet for your frustration.

I'm looking for a long term relationship. Not interested in a fling or any kind of hook up. I'd like to take my time and really get to know you.

Now on to the good stuff...
ME: 
I am a single mom who value's family above all else. I am 5'5 with medium length blondish/brown hair and a decent body. I am honest to the core and hope that we can share how sensual that can be. I will never take you for granted and I hope you feel the same..I like to be challenged. I am humble and open minded and like to walk through doors that have never been opened. I banter playfully with an air of coquettishness. I am always looking for a higher mountain to climb. I work hard when I have to but play even harder when given the opportunity. I am a true hedonist when it comes to food and wine. .I would like to meet someone with the same furor and desire..

YOU:
You are intellectual, but not over the top. You are handsome but without the ego. You have good etiquette and value in depth conversations. You don't always have to be right, but welcome the debate. Your financially stable, and welcome a future where you can share the road less traveled. 

YOU AND ME:
Things we could enjoy together? Picnics in the dunes. Champagne with tiny bubbles. Independent films.Cooking something together that we have never made. Hot springs in the mountains. Hiking to our favorite spot and admiring the sunset. Kissing slowly. Talking and listening. Listening and talking.

there was a woman who lived in San Francisco and after her ""forever"" prince turned to brass, she went in search of her Knight in Shining Armor (the real deal, not the stuff that turns green), the one who would sweep her off her feet, be her Renaissance Man, and love, respect, and cherish her for their happily after. 

After trying to spin straw into gold for one of her suitors, she learned he was only interested in the gold and not the special talents and qualities that she possesses. He wanted only the brand new gold, not realizing that gold never tarnishes and failed to realize that this craft took years of patience, skill and maturity to master. She didn't lose heart.

Her next suitor tried to awaken her passions to him with a kiss, not realizing that a woman of her caliber though passionate for the right Knight, wasn't an easy score. He tried to ply her with words of empty affection, promises of great intimacy, telling her things she wanted to hear and not the truth, in order to seduce her into his bed chambers. This didn't work but she kept her hopes high.

Next up was a very young suitor who was enamored with the notion of a cultured, experienced, intelligent woman who could educate and teach him things in the arts of love and though she was not particularly attractive and somewhat full figured which might turn off some, he ardently pursued her so that she could teach him these things. She gently put aside his affections because she knew she wanted a full, mature Knight who knew what he wanted and could care and cherish her. She still believes her Knight in shining armor is out there.

Are you the Knight she has been seeking these past few years to find? The one who eclipses all of her former suitors? If you think chivalry is alive and well, please reply to this posting. Please write as if you were sending a message to your future wife and tell her about why you are the Knight in Shining Armour she has been searching for.

Hello, I'm a divorced, college educated, professional female (software engineer). I'm attracted to Asian American men ( Korean, Japanese, Chinese). I just like the look of asian men. :-)

Interested in professional, easy-going man with a sense of humor. Seeking someone clean cut, well-rounded, and educated. Family, friends, and a balanced & healthy lifestyle are important. While I'm looking for the right LTR I'm not looking to rush things. Let's have fun getting to know each other and take it from there. Here list of a few more things I'm looking for.


-Non Smoker
-College degree
-Be financially responsible
-Single/Divorced (separated is not single or divorced)
-D/D free
-A nice/good guy
-HWP
-No facial hair
-Be available emotionally and have time to put into a relationship. I know we're all busy here in the Bay area but make sure you have the time to put into a relationship to give it the best shot of working. 
-Live within 20 miles of Fremont.
-I tend to do better with younger men... I'm 53 but have been told I look to be in my early 40s. Ideally 40-55 would be my range but I wouldn't disqualify based on age. 
-Most importantly I'm not looking for a guy to just settle down and grow old with.... I want a true dynamic and passionate connection. I'm looking for all the trapping of a relationship. 


If this sound like you, drop a line and tell me about yourself, No one liners, please use complete sentences and send a G-rated picture. In your reply post your location so I'll know you're real.
I'd like to exchange a few emails and then talk OTP before meeting.

Thanks,
Deborah

My sister is my best friend and I'd do anything for her. My friends would say I don't have any trouble getting attention from guys. But the truth is it's rare that I meet the type of guy I want to be with. I'm looking for someone who isn't cynical and appreciates the little things in life. Having Herpes has and will not stop me from living and loving to the fullest. I'm in my fifties and loving it, If you live in the Bay Area and looking for a long term relationship.

an honest and loyal woman. I am a ""normal"" woman in this crazy world who has her stuff together and is looking for a man that has the time and inclination to pursuit a relationship.

I smile a lot because I love life, with all of it's ups and downs. If you are looking for a woman that will have your back in all of it, as you would mine, a ride or die woman, then that's me.

Kids are grown and gone, so it's my time.

I enjoy a vast array of activities from exploring the Bay Area to flea markets.

I am comfortable in jeans and boots and don't mind playing grown up in a dress.

I don't drink or do drugs, I do smoke and have tasteful and important (to me) tattoos.

I'd prefer a man over 40 (or someone mature enough to understand a real relationship), unattached and looking for a relationship, who has his ""stuff"" together. 

There is lots more, please just ask and send a photo, if you would like a reply.

Enjoy another beautiful day!!

Are there are still any real, honest, SINGLE men who genuinely want to meet a cool, funny, down to earth girl who is not only good looking; funny; smart; etc. but really a good hearted person? Surprise me, because I am still hoping there are & you're in search of something amazing, also :)

Me: Spanish; Single; In my early 40's; Can be a goofball; I love having a great time & laughing, Not into down/lame people- so no thank you if that's you! I prefer fun, happy, honest & secure men who can hold a conversation and be interested in having one... perhaps face to face?

Seriously though- I'm ready to have a partner in crime (for fun stuff! Already made a pact w/ my bff to do the whole Thelma & Louise thing); I'm looking for someone who genuinely wants to build something deeper than just texts back & forth- like, I'd like to meet sooner rather than later & get to know each other face to face. Is that asking too much? IIIII don't think so, and if you're the right kind of guy for me? You wouldn't either!

I'm going be honest... my favorite color happens to be pink. Blue, green or hazel eyes? Huge bonus! Having all of your teeth (in good shape!) is a MUST... I have all mine, lol. I drink, occasionally smoke, I'm 420 friendly and I f you're still reading- what'cha waiting for? Send me an email telling me about yourself; What you're in to; Where you are in ""life"" (looking for someone who's serious, not just wasting our time here... life's short! I want to enjoy the rest of mine smiling!) & if you have a very RECENT picture of yourself (not of you in your 20's when you thought you looked super hot but now you're over 35 & don't really resemble your former self, lol! NOT that aging is bad... I just want to know what you look like NOW, not what the ""ideal"" version that you think yourself was) Please keep in mind that I'll always be honest & 100% real with you. I only ask for the same in return! oh- and most importantly... Did I mention? PLEASE. BE. SINGLE! 

Sorry- not sorry! I know what I like & know what I don't want. I'm serious about finding the right man to hopefully build a fun, flirty friendship with which may hopefully turn into more. Please be a good kisser, too... That's hot. lol. It's one of the best parts of being an adult- knowing that I have options to be picky & exercising my rights to say so... still there? lol

I'm not here looking a random hookup, a ""pen pal"" or to be a bored husband's ""friend"" or entertainment. Besides, if you're married? You shouldn't be in the ""LTR"" section of CL's. My post is ISO a single man who is ready to meet a woman who's looking for the real thing. hmmmkaaay? Thanks for reading my mini book! Now looking forward to the fun part...

There may be better ways to find what I am looking for and I still hope this ad will work. I guess here is where I say a little about myself. 
This seems like a very long time ago. We've married for ten years and now been widowed for ten. 
I am looking for a new man and a best friend. Looks are not important, However health is a high priority. If you smoke, do drugs or other unhealthy behavior, don't respond.
I am adventurous, like to travel and try out new things. Especially exciting are new places. For example, I love to discover National Parks and care little about crowded tourist attractions. However, even when we are travelling I hope you like to be comfortable. It's not important to find the most expensive places but cleanliness is crucial. 

It would be fantastic If you are around my age (or a little younger) who likes to travel, entertains intellectual conversations, and it open to new experiences. One more thing, I own my home and I am financially stable.

Please leave a little details about yourself, age, location, ethnicity, phone, email address.

Attractive SWF, mid-40's, looking for an attractive activity partner and, if there's attraction on both sides, for something meaningful (beyond friendship). 

I'm passionate, sensual, down-to-earth, educated, love to dance, love to travel, love animals, enjoy life performances and movies, the outdoors, weekend trips, sports (skiing, ice-skating, tennis, etc.) or just strolling through S.F.'s neighborhoods.

Thank you though!

Shhhhhhh don't tell my friends or kids I'm on craigslist!! Yeah yeah yeah I know - wth am I here for? I'm on a few dating sites.....eh - I guess I need to actually invest time and thought into them. I get contacted but I don't reply much........I know right?! I'm just to the point of not wanting to see another picture of a man holding a fish or not smiling and looking all sad - or is that an attempt to look cool and standoffish? Who knows? 

Movie tonight? I'm up for a comedy. Who's in?!

I'm not posting a picture here. That's silly. I will say I'm 5'4"" and blond (woohoo!) - HWP and I'm a feisty 49 year old professional woman (software sales for far too long). I have a great sense of humor which I haven't used enough lately, thus the need for a comedy! 


You: publicly presentable - you know ya clean up well and practice good personal hygiene, single (none of this but we don't have anything in common anymore stuff - not my problem!) Pleeeeeease be able to carry a conversation and have a sense of humor. You know - in case we get ice cream afterward or something. 

Oh one more thing - do not under any circumstances reply if you're voting Republican. The last date I went on didn't end well when he told me that he though Bill O'Reilly is the only newscaster that tells the truth. Believe me - it's funny now......

Not sure how this will turn out, but why not...

I'm a beautiful 21 year old woman. I am multi racial, I stand about 5'3 & I have light brown eyes. I'm considered a ""small bbw"", but I'm curvy & proportionate. I have two awesome little boys. I have my own place in south bay. I am kind, submissive at times, funny, honest, & mature. I am very outgoing and optimistic. I love romance,? cuddling,? & long walks on the beach (so cliche but true). I have a sense of humor & love to have fun doing just about anything (cooking, movies, shopping, walks...). I go to the gym a few days a week and I enjoy playing tennis. I love watching sports (mainly tennis & football). Not very good at playing video games but I'll damn sure try ;) I have a career & I also run a small catering business from my home. I have my own car too.

So on to what I'm looking for.... a handsome (black) man that shares similar interests as i. You have to like or love kids. Please be nice.... you'd be surprised how many mean guys approach me :(? I would prefer older than I am, however age doesn't really matter as long as your attractive. 

Here's the kicker.... why am I single?? Lol. I have been in a lesbian relationship for about 3 years and I'm finally free. I haven't been with a man in years. No I don't want just sex. I actually want more than that. Please send me a photo, i will reply almost immediately with mine & we can go from there.

Thanks for reading my book (lol)....

I'm 36, kind and thoughtful, open-minded, intelligent, neither a mover nor a shaker yet still quietly ambitious, a design student, living alone, and--because I know you care--reasonably attractive.

I also:

am terribly low-maintenance and find joy in the simplest things, and only occasionally demanding (mostly of myself... I am not fond of mediocrity);

can be a bit of a loner, though I cherish time spent with friends;

have a pretty well-developed sense of humor (which sometimes veers toward the dark and cynical, but I'm a compassionate person I swear);

enjoy listening to music--both live (almost exclusively at smaller venues) and recorded;

value creativity and spirituality (among other things of course--I just happen to be focused on these two things at the moment).

I'm absolutely not looking for anything serious right away. I would like someone to spend time with, have a few beers with, go to shows or movies with, listen to records with--you get the idea. I'm not hung up on what you possess, what you do (as long as it's legal), or physical attributes that you have no control over (though I think you should find yourself attractive and take care of yourself).

I do prefer that you be around my age, relatively stable, and easy-going. Bonus points if you can make people laugh, work with your hands (even as an avocation), have a knack for storytelling, have great taste in music, or love garage/rummage sales. 

Photos are appreciated, will be treated with care, and of course will be reciprocated if I think we might be a good match.

I'm not a hopeless romantic, not sentimental, not shy, not drama queen, and probably not sweet. So, if you looking for a sweet babe - it's not me. 

I'm realistic but optimistic, opinionated but polite, positive, empathetic but not into a pity party, strong, full of energy and enthusiasm, adventurous but not foolhardy, intelligent and educated. I'm white 46 years old, attractive, and fit. I take care of myself, and have a healthy life style. I prefer outdoor activities - hikes, walks, travel. TV, movies, video games are only for the rainy days, however I would prefer meaningful conversations, and good books. What else? I love to cook, and I do it well. I'm sensual and feminine. I'm very loyal friend.

Who am I looking for? Confident, with good manners man, physically fit, bright, intelligent, with sense of humor, and stable career. Someone who is able to have deep meaningful conversations. Friend, lover, soul mate. Between 40 to 50 years old. Tall. Smart. Empathetic. Single or divorced. 

For the first date I would prefer quiet place where we can talk, walk, or hike, but I'm not into eating high-calories food or spending hours in a dark theater without a single dialogue. I also don't want to know all cheesy details about your former relationships, and I don't provide therapy sessions.

Not looking for a hook up or some fwb situation, so let's not waste each other's time. I'm 36, Asian, down to earth, little thick, sweet amongst other things you can get to know tonight. I'm looking for someone who likes to laugh, simple, and knows how to throw a joke back when I come out with one. Please be single, around my age, and somewhat normal. Bonus if you're cute and athletic - I'm such a sucker for those.

Let's exchange a couple of emails and we can go from there. Email with pics will mostly get a response.

Ugh sad. But I've made amazing friends on here before so here it goes. I'm a genuine person. What u see is what you get. Although every single day of my life I strive to better myself and my children. There's always room for improvement.😃🤓 I choose to wrap myself in music and art. I love snowboarding I own my own and all my gear! 🏂 Ufc is the best sport ever to me! I love jeans n under armor tennis. But I'm a girly girl n if I go out I'm all heels n cute dresses. I'm very kind. I treat every single person in the world the same. From a bum on the street to my best friend all are equal and Gods children😇 I like Church I'm Catholic and that's important to me as I go every Sunday. I'm a cool chic I'm down to earth my personality is like a hippie type girl that is proud to say I'm from the South Tennessee 😃 As I said looking for love in all the wrong places 💋

I'm looking for the real deal, a long term relationship that, hopefully, ends with marriage and family. 

A little about me before we move on to what I'm looking for in a man. I'm 25 years old, college educated, and a full-time healthcare professional and student. I'm tall, 5'6"" and not height-weight proportional. Yes that mean I'm overweight, and if you don't like it, move to the next ad. I'm shy and soft-spoken around new people, but once I open up, you find that I'm dedicated, faithful, family orientated, sarcastic, ambitious, and intelligent. I'm not a country girl, other than riding horses. I like traveling and boating, movies and music, concerts and art museums. I'm comfortable eating out before the opera or ballet, as much as I'm comfortable grilling and watching a movie at the house. Just look beyond my looks. Surely there is someone in this city that can do that. 

If you think you're up to the challenge, email me. Change the subject line to your favorite restaurant.

You're in your late forties or older and have free time in the evenings. You're attached or not, and you're open to a special friend who is attached. You want a friend and lover who will be your silly partner in crime, who will stimulate your brain and your senses, who has a high emotional intelligence because you do as well. You're looking for a long-term relationship, one that has meaning. But not one that will negatively affect other relationships that you have.
You're also willing to take some time sharing emails, and then speaking on the phone, before arranging to meet in public, to see if there is really a spark. You're willing to take your time, to make this a real relationship.

I enjoy learning and testing out new recipes. I love window shopping in the Big City just for fun. Initially I would like to email one another to see if we are a match and then we could also talk at night or during the weekends on Facebook or mobile phone.

Hi There!

When I've posted before I've described myself first and what I'm looking for second. I'm reversing the order this time in the hope that I'll get fewer replies that are way outside the parameters I describe. So here goes. 

WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR:
Please live in San Francisco (or at least close to a nearby BART station), be taller than I am, and reasonably close to my age. 

I'm looking for a long-term - hopefully life-long relationship with someone who wants a companion for hiking/biking/walks, intellectual pursuits, cooking/eating, humor, and emotional/physical intimacy - a close friend and lover. 

ABOUT ME:
I am warm, intelligent, passionate, and in good shape. I exercise daily (usually by bicycling up to Twin Peaks). I have green eyes and dark brown, wavy hair. I'm 5'8"".

Some of the things I enjoy include hiking and bicycling or just wandering around San Francisco. I love animals and nature. I like all kinds of restaurants, independent and foreign movies, cooking and sharing a delectable meal at home. I'm an avid reader, listen to NPR a lot, and am a subscriber to City Arts & Lectures. I'm fairly well-traveled (lived in Europe for 8-1/2 years) and would like to do more - especially in Africa and Central & South America. 

If the above resonates with you, please tell me a little about yourself and send me a photo. Let's meet for a drink of some kind and get to know each other.

I'm an energetic outgoing single good black woman that work hard and can hold my own and looking for the same in a good man. I believe life is what you make it and it's twice as nice with the right partner. I do think chemistry is of the utmost importance; however honesty, integrity and loyalty are keys to a great relationship. I like doing thing inside and outside, traveling, shopping comedy; music concerts working out and plays in addition to cooking and just about anything as long as I am not harmed and at times watching TV with that special one just doing whatever.
I have kissed a few frogs and I'm ready to kiss my last frog to get to my life partner.
I'm a youthful 50yrs old, 5'7 a little thick in the hips (however no complaints from the men thus far) LOl love to dress up and down in a part of jeans. Oh yes and please send a picture if you would like me to reply.

I miss you. Yes. I go to the baseball games, the fleas, the theater, the museum, the beach, the movies, the Laotian dive, the movies, to Chrissy Field with the puppy, to the top of the mountain. I go with friends or on my own for I have learned that being on my own is better than being with the wrong man. Yet, I miss you. For it is more fun to turn to you and revel in the fact that we both get the same jokes, the same odd cultural references. I want you to teach me your history. Have you learn mine, then join forces to make new history.

You are funny, smart, grown up, happy to be who you are and you are single. I am 60, proud to be who I am. You are perhaps between 40 and 70ish, just so long as you know that we will always have Paris.

I look forward.

I'm writing this on a whim, so I might miss some things. But it's something I've been contemplating for some time now.

I'll try to be brief, honest, and straightforward.

For a while I've juggled friends/partners because each offered part of what I wanted. 
Guy, #1- great in bed, but unavailable otherwise.
Guy, #2- Loves to travel and we go on fun adventures regularly, but we clash fundamentally/he lacks otherwise.
Girl, #3- We've had much fun together both in and out of the bedroom but it's become a friendship since she's committed elsewhere.
Guy, #4- good in bed, but schedules ruin continuity.

Yes, at one point I was involved with these 4 in the same time frame/month or so. And 1/3, 3/4 simultaneously. But, it was more so to try to fulfill my needs rather than pure promiscuity, though I have nothing against that. I'm open minded and respectful of people's preferences. My only reservations are against unsafe sex (I'm a germaphobe)

So, now that I've put it all out there, I'll move on to what I'm searching for.

Ideally, I want a singular person. One person that I can count on to be my friend, lover, adventure partner, and partner in crime- and one that has the time to be such a thing on a regular basis (1-2xs wk at least) 

Granted, that is a lot to ask for... and probably unrealistic seeing as the only way I was able to achieve somewhat fulfillment of these needs was through various different individuals. But, I'll try for it nonetheless. 

Now that you've seen the inner workings of my happily perverted life, please reply with the following: subject line: ""#1"", picture, brief description about you, your likes, desires, current situation, and availability. 

P.s. I am mostly a sub, with some dominant tendencies.

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, in which city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

I like daytrips to Monterey or northern California, anywhere near water is what I crave. I'd like a companion to go out to lunch or dinner, to a movie, or share some other nice activity.

I am not an athletic woman. You don't need to be an athlete to make me happy. Just be honest, and be yourself. Have some time on your hands and enjoy dating.

I have no issues attracting a man, but seem to have difficulty finding the right one. As much as I enjoy sex and believe it is an important part of any relationship, I am interested in getting to know someone and building a foundation first. If you share the same values and you are a single white, professional, male between the ages of 35 and 40, let me know. I don't care what kind of job you have or how much money you make, as long as you're not someone expecting me to take care of you financially.

I am an attractive (I will send a pic) white female, dark hair and blue eyes. I do work a lot, but I love my job and definitely try to make the most of my time off. I enjoy getaway weekends or spending the day in wine country as well as trying new foods and experiences. I also enjoy quiet nights, cuddling and watching movies. I'm open minded and try to see things from different perspectives.

If you're interested, please respond a pic (of your face, if you want a response) and I will send you one in return.

Hi-

I am looking for a fellow who is interested in photography. I normally shoot film and I'm currently interested in doing a walking photo tour of Vallejo. There are many oddities in Vallejo, back alleyways and abandoned buildings; it's an arbitrary and desolate place. I am hoping to find someone to explore it with. 

I would prefer someone between the age of 25-35, who is able to hold a conversation and has some artistic and intellectual sensibilities. Please respond with a bit about yourself, interests, what type of camera you shoot with. Stuff like that. Thanks!

hello. i'm a happy, kinky, intelligent and attractive black woman seeking a lover. i'm easy going and open minded, but i'm not looking for a hook up right away. on the other hand, if you capture my interest in a real way, i hope we would meet for coffee or a drink and see what the chemistry is like since ultimately that is what matters most to me.

my ideal friend is over 35, single or openly poly. please note: while i'm open to a playmate that has a partner/s, i'm not looking to play with a couple. also, if you are in need of secrecy, we are not a match. (discretion is different in my book, and something i do well.) i'm looking for someone open-minded, intelligent, sexy with a good sense of humor. a full figured woman turns him on. i'm especially fond of men of color and I give extra points for being over 6 feet and nice hands. 420 friendly? cool!

interested? send me a note and a pic please. i'll return the favor.

I'm very funny with a great sense of humor, very capable and intelligent. I'm 5'9"" so looking for a gentleman who is taller than me, at least 5'11"", in his 40/50s, who will treat me right and who lives within 30 miles of Rohnert Park, CA. 

I love trying new things like hiking, taking mini vacations, camping, and skydiving, anything fun and exciting. I'm attracted to funny men who will keep me smiling and come up with new adventures for us to try. I want someone who is looking for a serious long term relationship, is mature but with a fun side. I want someone to talk to, listen to, to bounce ideas off of, to share great kisses (I love to kiss), to flirt and intertwine in one another's lives on all levels.

I'm having the most wonderful time in my life with good friends and two great children that I share amicably with my ex. I'm finding things manageable, fun and drama-free, with plenty of happiness to be found in my work and my personal life. But I don't always want to play with my kids or my friends, sometimes I'm just a woman with sparkling eyes and a mischievous knowing smile, ready to...fully...enjoy time with my man.

In terms for what I seek here...friendship foremost and from there, someone with whom to explore the world and various experiences. 

I'm in my 40s, financially and emotionally stable, have a great network of family and friends and look for the same in my partner. I'm looking for that special someone with whom to enjoy adventures, as well as quiet moments.

Intelligent, sarcastic, witty, creative, open-minded people fascinate me. I enjoy being with people who make me think, who question the norm and/or who seek to make a difference in the world (in any way they can). Humor is very important. I love to laugh. Sarcasm too. Humor with a bite. 
I love banter, whatever the topic. But don't worry, I'm friendly, giving and open minded. :)

. . .just one man who is age-appropriate (60-75), close in geography (I live mid-peninsula), and similarly inclined (read on).

Neither of us is currently partnered, and we crave the steadfast companionship and deep intimacy we have experienced and expressed in past monogamous relationships. Living long has made us far wiser than we were in our youth. We acknowledge our imperfections and recognize that understanding, compassion, affection, and acceptance are essential to a lasting relationship.

We are both intelligent, articulate people, active and involved, socially and politically liberal, and financially stable. We're still healthy, energetic, and attractive, and we intend to keep ourselves that way for many years to come.

Here are some specifics about me:

I am HWP (5'4"" tall, ~137 lbs.) and Caucasian. Raised east-coast Jewish, for the past two decades I have been an active member of a progressive religious community that includes people of all persuasions. I am omnivorous, and get along best with those similarly inclined. Semi-retired now, I continue to seek ways to contribute my experience and energy to people and projects that make a difference in the world. Among the pastimes I enjoy are music and dancing, puzzles, cooking and savoring good food and beverage, hiking and exploring (especially with my canine companion), flowers and plants, computers and the Internet, movies and some TV, home maintenance and renovation. My social and political leanings are decidedly liberal/progressive.

If you resonate with this post, I hope you'll write to tell me about yourself (age and location are essential!), what you're looking for, why you're responding. When you do, please attach a current photo; I will happily reciprocate if we seem to be a match.

I'm a woman who consider herself spiritual, caring, and very genuine nothing fake. I believe honesty, communication and commitments can develop a good and healthy relationship. I love romance and believe in Love, yes I still do.

What am I looking in you ? Caring, compassionate, "" attractive"" with great values and not perfect although it sounds that way. I am not perfect either but an attractive Latin woman.

I miss having a good relationship and my best friend. I want us to enjoy life, its that time We can plan vacations and other activities we might be interested I believe we have earned this time in life already. On the other hand I would love to be sitting next to you watching a good movie or show, relax for our days weather day weather they are easy or hard ones. I am not the best cook but I can do some good Spanish recipes....you might be surprise. !!! Believe me I am not trying to make you gain weight at all...Lol , I do happen to like fit men who can take care of themselves , and live a healthy life.

I do have a son in my care but I am not asking for a daddy replacement, he has his and loved him very much, they spend weekends together so I find myself without a good company wanting to find my ltr guy who will make me happy not only weekends but weekdays.

If you think this is what you might be interested I would love to hear from you. I will also ask for those who I disappoint in this search to not delete my ad ( lol ) and act like a real grown and respectful man please. Thank you.

There's nothing better than spending time together with a man that's smart, creative, and a bit sexy. And one who enjoys going to farmer's market for fresh produce!

I'm 5'3, - and in shape, as I enjoy working out. I'm stable, sane, employed, and have my own home. I enjoy cultural outings, outdoor activities, and the genuine companionship of someone in a similar life situation whose interests match my own. I'm well read, politically astute, and enjoy a great conversation.

Now for the harder stuff: I'm looking to expand my social life and possibly meet someone special. A friend first that evolves and grows into something more. I think the best couples are friends as well as lovers.

I'm looking for a SWM professional (white collar) guy who is grounded, reliable, and introspective. Someone who is comfortable enough in his own skin to see the humor in life's ups and downs and can laugh at himself. Someone close to my age who lives nearby. I live in Concord (boring, I know!!)

I like to spend time hanging out in the City catching some lunch or checking out an art gallery and then a hike and out for drinks. Maybe swimming out here in the east bay, being lazy in the sun for a bit, and then going to a movie. Or maybe you teach me something totally out of my comfort zone.

I like fast cars and guys who enjoy speed. Not much beats taking a drive with the top down and the music up loud. I like going out dancing and there is something so sensual as being in the arms of a man on the dance floor.

I like people who enjoy taking a risk and going to new places and trying new items on the menu. You never know until you give it a try!

I also enjoy that connection to spirituality, whatever that means for each of us. I believe there is a greater power out there and that gives me a lot of satisfaction and peace. I'm a beginner when it comes to meditation but spending some quiet time going inward helps me deal with life's challenges.

I'm attracted to a confident man - one who is driven by the need to succeed - but who also has another side to him. A funny, silly side. And understands the work/life balance. And, who when teased, can laugh at himself a bit.

I am still holding out for what I know to be a healthy relationship and will not settle for anything less for the both of us.
My definition of a healthy relationship is compatibility, reliability, honesty, mutual respect and admiration, and lots of chemistry. Chemistry is a must. Without a spark there is no flame and I prefer hot over cold any day.
Not looking to change you and not looking for you to change me. Take me as I am and I will do the same for you. That is if I like you! LOL
I have my serious, mature, responsible side that takes care of business, pays the bills, cooks, cleans, comforts, nurtures, and loves. My not so serious side takes me on adventures in our beautiful state, Kauai, walks on the beach, drives up and down the coast, movies, bowling, shooting pool and shooting the s#$t, evenings with friends, dinner with family, game nights, and so much more than I could put here.
Trying new things, meeting new people, and being open minded to how the world operates and how other people think keeps me excited and motivated to do and be more. Compassion and empathy is how I practice looking at the world. We all need it. Try it it's good for you.
There is so much more to us than we could ever put here so when you respond please tell me at least as much about yourself as I did about myself under ""helpful details"". It won't kill you.

Life would be so much easier if we could have anything or anyone we wanted, but it really doesn't work that way, does it? I continue to post because I have faith that sooner or later someone is going to enter this doorway at just the moment he is supposed to, but it feels as though the loneliness that comes between is almost unbearable. 

Which is difficult for others to understand. The loneliness. Mine doesn't come from discord at home, as I read constantly in my inbox. It comes from a place inside, and isn't anything I want to explain to anyone but the right person. The right person will accept who I am and want to spend time with me anyway, even if it isn't everlasting. And let's be honest; affairs never last, do they? They ignite and then they burn out and we move on. 

Someone asked me recently why I didn't choose him, and I tried to explain the kind of connection I need. Then the next day I met someone and asked why he didn't choose me. it's just impossible to put into words, until we find each other. Then sometimes the words come but the rest is magic. 

So, here are some things about me... I'm nothing spectacular to look at. You're going to be attracted to my soul, anyway, if we're the right match. We need to be attracted physically too of course which is why I'm asking for your picture when you respond. I don't need to see your bare chest or your hat or sunglasses, but a face, because a face says a lot. I'm not a go out and party kind of girl, but a quiet sort. We can cross these things off the list; fun in the sun, hiking, biking, massages, and coffee dates. I'm looking for a quiet place to be, away from my chaotic life, in the company of someone I can talk to and just be with. 

You are 45-60ish who isn't hung up about being their age (younger and 'young at heart' need not apply), relatively stable and reasonably mature. Smoking is a deal breaker. I like tall, smart and well put together. I want someone to talk with virtually (by way of text or some kind of app) at first, and in between being together. If you're too busy for that, you won't have time for someone like me. Attentiveness without smothering is key. You're not looking for the love of your life because I already have mine, but you feel that friendship is important. You won't shy away from complexity, you're patient, and you won't try to fix or change me. Acceptance is paramount. I'm not here for a one and done. I want to invest in you without taking away anything which you already have. And you will have some flexibility in your weekday/night schedule. 

I've been told that men don't read all the way to the end. Let's see if that's true. 

So, to recap.. You're older than me, taller than me, willing to share me, communicative, mature. Basically, don't be a dick. I need a little more kindness and a touch of sensitivity around me, and someone I can believe in. You're going to send me a picture, you'll tell me your age so I don't have to pry it out. And you're going to impress me with at least 25 words. They'll come easy to one who holds the magic. 

Well, I'm going to let old Gordo say it best; Rainy day people always seem to know when it's time to call. Rainy day people don't talk, they just listen till they've heard it all. Rainy day lovers don't lie when they tell 'ya they've been down like you. Rainy day lovers don't love any others, that would not be kind. Rainy day people all know how it hangs on a peace of mind. Rainy day lovers don't hide love inside they just pass it on...

After your proper introduction, send me a song too..

I used to think that, as an overweight woman, all I had to offer was my personality (which is pretty awesome sauce) but it turns out that I am also a sex object. Who knew? Now I can't wait to have a man use me for my brain.

I am probably most men's worst nightmare because I want a serious relationship. I don't need to walk down the aisle in a fluffy white dress, but I would like to get married at some point. I am not interested in having kids of my own, but if you have them, that is fine with me. So, I won't put any pressure on you to do these things NOW, but you have to see a commitment with someone in your future in order to get a response from me. 

I am a professional woman with a demanding career. I am ambitious and I take my work, but not myself, very seriously. I only work 40 hours a week, and I have many hobbies, so I am achieving some kind of work-life balance. I am looking for a partner who wants to make plans with me, but also wants to succeed in work and explore his interests. I will give you space, but it would be nice to know that you miss me sometimes.

If you are a mature and educated man, with a serious relationship in mind, I would love to hear from you. Sense of humor is really important to me, and I tend to be the funnier person in the relationship, but I would love for you to show me up. 

I have posted before but never seem to connect with anyone long-term. Follow through is important. I am a woman of action looking for a man of action.

About me: 

Very pretty SWF, size 4, a looker! 
Professional / advanced degrees 
Avid runner 
Yoga practitioner 
Love all things pink and purple 

My smile and eyes are my most prominent and attractive features 
I love the woods 
I love staying up late and seeing the dawn, lazy Sundays in bed with you 

I love to have fun and cut up with someone special - once a special relationship has been established 
Trying to teach myself Italian (slow process) 

A smart, quick thinking man is the ultimate turn-on for me 
I am delightful, delicious, demure, even dainty, subtle, sweet, sexy. 

The type of man I seek: 
I am seeking a successful, confident, and intelligent SWM, 56-72, who knows how to enjoy life. 
A man who will break his routine and try something new, or maybe try something new that he did not enjoy 7 years ago, 
like to learn a new language, a new dance, a new sport (i.e. - cross-country skiing). 

I am seeking a man who is looking for one woman to be his partner - a man who wants a longterm companion to engage in discovery with. 
Prefer a SWM who is well-educated (grad. degrees), sensitive and moved by nature, animals and the arts, a gentleman, kind to everyone 
(including waiters :-), 
successful in his chosen profession and he should still be excited about his professional work. 

Note - a man who dreads his work would not be a good match for me. 

Important - you must be truly single - not separated or married. Age IS important - I look very young - but I am Not attracted to young men. 
I am interested in meeting a SWM between the ages of 56-72. 

An interesting letter and your photo will turn my head and increase the chances that we meet. 
Please respond with a descriptive letter. Picture a Must for a response.

Hey guys.?

I dont have a ton of hope that I'll find the guy I'm looking for here on CL. But, stranger things have happened.?
I'm looking to meet a genuine man, with a brain, a sense of humor, a kind spirit, an adventurous soul, and a pension for Big women. I dont have alot of expectations other then respect and honesty. I'm tired of not having someone to snuggle with, someone to travel with, do fun things with, other then my friends. I want something deeper then casual, but I do understand that its got to start somewhere, and I'm in no rush to get to wherever it is we end up. If you're only looking to get laid, I'm not the girl for you. So please dont waste either of our time. Sex is important to me,but I'm not looking for a friend with benefits thing...I have that if i want it, I dont. So if you're sweet (big plus if you're a sexy geek) and it seems like I could be someone you'd like to get to know, let me know and we'll talk. Your pic, gets mine. tell me about you and what youre looking for. i wont respond to any one line reply, or any without a pic (and dont send a dick pic, seriously) take a second and make a little effort if youre really interested. Lets get this thing started.

I am near 60 and unable to work due to aches & pains but I can walk and get around pretty good otherwise.

Maybe you are retired and live alone. 
Maybe you want someone who needs somebodies help, someone to spend your days with, someone to take a short walk with, shop with, see a movie with, go out to eat with. 

Someone like you!

It wouldn't matter to you that I don't have a job because I just can't work with this body that is beautiful but painful, or that I had a surgery last year and so now I am a transgendered person (yes I am all female)...and I look good! I am kind of quiet & shy. Also, I don't mind cooking!

Good day to you, sweets!


Quick intro ~ 

I am semi new to SF and am hoping to eventually find someone to share life in the city with (LTR). I am searching via CL (and oh my, how creepy and scary it seems sometimes, for both men and women alike) because of discretion, unlike what you find on main stream dating sites. I know a woman like me should NOT be on CL, but, we all have to start somewhere and, hey, when you know what you want and deserve, sometimes it takes a bit longer to find :) Let's cut to what matters...

About me and in no particular order:

I live in SF
30 years old and 100% woman (this is SF, you never know)
I'm 5'8"" tall and weigh 128 pounds
Mixed Race
Athletic build- 32DDD bust - 26"" waist (size 2/3) - 32"" hips
I model but am a rookie 'techie' too 
I can dress with the best as I love fashion but I'm not afraid to get down and dirty
I have tattoos and piercings 
I have a BS in BioChem and practiced clinical pharmacy for seven years
I speak three languages 
I love to travel and learn about culture
I enjoy music, news, and politics
I am an atheist 
Come from a great, healthy, and stable home 
I take pride in being a little different from what I feel/see as being the norm, so I strive to be better
I am domesticated (no, this doesn't mean I pop out babies left and right and stay cooking in the kitchen)
I cook, clean, and am tidy/organized
I am emotionally stable and strong
I listen and speak well
I love unconditionally
I compete with myself to better myself, as I am my only competition, not other women or men.
I am 4/20 friendly however not tobacco or any other 'drug' friendly
Social drinker but no alcoholic 'red-flag' tendencies 
I am honest and real 
I can have an intellectual conversation with both the neighborhood thug and the president (meaning diversity has been perfected). 
I love to learn
I am consistent and committed (no games)
I am laid back and open-minded but can be out-spoken when necessary
I am fun and funny
I love all indoor/outdoor activities
I am active/fit
I enjoy going out as well as staying in
I am disease free....no bugs on/in me! 
I take care of myself... hygiene is a must! I come from the medical field!

My man would be something like....... (and in no particular order):

Age between 35-60
Tall.... preferably a minimum of 6'0 ft. (I'm a tall one)
Clean 
Hygiene keen
Fun with sense of humor 
I don't discriminate on race..... come one, come all!
Wealthy/successful.....so many gold diggers. I'm not. Period. Actions will prove it such and if we meet, I'll explain why
Passionate
Well mannered
Well traveled
Educated
Speaks well....although it's not necessary to be all conservative ALL the time....speak freely. You're with me, not your boss!
Family oriented 
Enjoys kids and/or wants some/more of his own
Experienced in dating. Please, we are grown. You should know what it is you're looking for at this point in life
Solid decision maker and mentally stable.... I'm not a creep. You need not be one either. It's okay to be excited! NOT a creep.
Secure in life and with self
Someone real on the first date (and consistently real thereafter for that matter). You get to meet me, not my representative. Just be you. I like that!
I'm looking for a man who enjoys feeling special too! We all need it. 
A man who appreciates a woman who keeps the house just as clean as her nails and teeth.
I'm looking for a man who would appreciate coming home to a healthy, home-cooked meal hot and ready on the table after a long days work and much more....
Someone who resides in San Francisco only
Someone active physically and enjoys an array of activities, that life and this very city have to offer 

I just cut to the chase. It makes this process much easier. Please respond with something personal in the title of your reply so I know you are real. Please also include a pic. I'm sure you'd like one in return and it's only fair! This is extremely important as I don't want anyone's time wasted on long conversations with absolutely zero physical attraction (which, we as adults know looks aren't everything but they amount to 90% of 'step one' in the dating world). NO pic, NO response. I'm also not into a million and one emails back and forth. Let's chat and connect! No drama. No games. No lies. I am who I say I am. I'd ask for the same in return. I expect the best because that's all I have to give :) 

Happy searching, gentlemen and thank you for the time! xo

My interests include reading (fiction, mysteries mainly) television (hour drama shows along with a few of the better half hour sit coms) playing board games, especially Scrabble.

I am into a healthy lifestyle which includes getting on the treadmill several times a week, maintaining a normal weight and being vegetarian, sugar free, additive and preservative free as well.

I enjoy going to movies, plays, concerts, exhibits and the like.

I am divorced and childless.

If your stats are compatible with mine and you are either divorced or widowed, I would enjoy hearing from you. I prefer someone within a few miles of Bergen County (Paramus area) so that we can meet on a whim when we feel like it.

Please tell me about yourself the same kind of things I have told you about me. AGE, MARITAL STATUS, EDUCATIONAL LEVEL and PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION are mandatory. For the recored, I am 5' and weigh 115.

I look forward to some quality replies from some quality people. A simple ""How ya doing?"" gets deleted w/o a response.

Later............

As I sit here and ponder on what I am looking for and what I desire, I had to take time to reflect on those in which I have met on here. 

Over the past 6 months I have learned so much about myself, about dating, about who I am, who I want to be and most important, what I am looking for in a partner. 

In that time, I have loved, I have lost, I have created great memories, but most of all, I have become a stronger, better woman. 

The heartbreak was almost unbearable, but I am not looking at with any regrets. I was a scared, weak, fragile woman when I met the man that changed my life forever. He turned me into this beautiful woman, who is strong, confident, loving, and yes still a little fragile. The stars were all aligned the night we met. Little did I know that the stars would slowly fade, and in time go their separate ways. He as often questioned why he had such an impact on me. My answer to that is: He treated me like a woman, he had respect for me, and he showed me what love was all about. 

Since this man left my life, I have found it to be a struggle to find someone of quality. That is why I question if this is the right place to look. That is when I am reminded of him and all hope comes back, that there will be that one amazing man out there for me. I can't give up and waste this precious heart by not sharing it with the right person. 

With all that being said, let me tell you a little more abut myself: 

I am single, I have a professional career, I also have children, my own place, my own vehicle, and a kindred spirit. I enjoy going for walks in the evenings, long mountains drives to nowhere, outdoor concerts, a glass of wine by the fireplace, a cup of coffee on the patio, camping, watching movies, cuddling and many more things. 

I am looking for someone between 35-50, employed, independent, romantic, fun loving, outgoing, has moral, family values, and not afraid to show emotion. 

So, after reading my short story, if you are interested in getting to know me more, all I can say is that you won't regret it. Even if we don't have a physical attraction, we can have a wonderful friendship. 

I look forward to hearing from you. Have a great weekend.

I'm open to a good hearted man of ANY RACE ages 30 to 40 years old, that's done and had enough of the dating scene WANTS something stable, long term and exciting. I'm only interested in a NON cigarette smoker but 420 is ok, as long as your a career responsible man. Please no hard core drugs.

Takes pride in his hygiene (clean mouth hygiene for kissing) and lives in a clean environment for company. A man that cherishes me and thinks I'm beautiful with the add ons and without the add ons. I tend to cherish someone special when there's a connection and something meaningful as well.

Hello everyone, I am a 26 Asian female. Recently graduated with my Bachelor degree, and been having a stable job for over two years. And now I am here for someone who wants something serious (LTR) but willing to take time to know each other at first. 
**If you would think I am not serious just because I am taking my time to filter down who I'd send my pics to, then you really dont need to spend much more time reading. But I can tell you, if you are serious you will not judge the other side of the monitor with a photo**

About you, I'd like someone 
1. Who is a mature, caring, and also has a stable job, willing to take initiative in a relationship. 
2. Open to accept other culture, as I am from China; though I have learned to accept and practice American culture, I still carry some of mine. Be patient with my not so good English
3. Age 25-35. 
4. Do NOT do any drug, or smoke. 
5. If you have a couple tattoo is fine, but know your skin is not a scratch paper. (oh also there werent your ex's name, or something like that. lol)
6. Caucasian is a plus, but I am open to any race. 
7. Open to share about your thoughts, minds, and belief. In another words, honest. 
8. Someone who I would share my free time (and willing to spend his time with me)
etc......

About me, recently get out of a relationship, which hasnt been sparking for a while, and the fact it was ""foggy"" for our future was what really pushed me away. I would not say I am cute or in good shape, which isnt being humble or crucial on myself, but honest. However, I am not ugly or SUPER overweight. To me, how someone looks is different accordingly. Someone may rate me way too fat, but someone may rate me just right. Some may say I am cute, some may say I am just a typical Asian. 

Anyways, as mentioned, everyone would have a different descriptions on the same person. If you want to figure out how you would want to describe me, and you found my post suits you. Please do not hesitate to reply. I am open to answer question if you have any (Though, I may not answer.. Believe me, I am rather avoid your question, then lying to you)

TTYL :)
and good luck hunting!!

Okay, I know the zip code and place is different there's a reason for that. See I'm in lake county BUT what I want to go to is in Santa Rosa as well as where I plan to move to.
Wine Country Comic Con Check it out
No pictures of me sorry but they distract from who I am and I want someone who likes me not my looks. I will give one if asked as long as I get one back. The goal here is to meet people after all got to know who you are meeting.
Any of below sounds good reply to me with your favorite quote or movie phrase.
Now for as much as I love my fandoms, I ain't got nobody to share them with. I need others to talk about them with I can be single forever, not what I want but yeah, I need people to do things with above all else. I want people who know just which show I'm quoting when I say a certain phrase if they can respond with the next phrase they may get a hug for being awesome. I'm not the extreme fan girl not even in the more normal fandoms I am a part of but I like to talk about the characters and create headcanons.
Right now I'm a Deadpool, mind you a very sexy Deadpool but yeah, everyone thinks I'm crazy but puts up with me. When I start to bop my head along to a Disney song softly mumbling the words they just ignore it or roll their eyes. Don't even get me started on trying to explain why I just NEED to go to any comic con. This one is the closest I've found and Power Rangers so win.
I want to find my tribe of weirdos the group that makes me realize I'm not as crazy or weird as everyone treats me. I've heard conventions are a wonderful way to find them and lifelong friendships made from them. There is no forum for the WCCC if that is even still a thing. So I'll try here since I ain't got nobody on facebook either so people wonder if it's a fake account. I'm real though just have no clue how to talk to people without just putting it out there. And saying I'm an ENTP only excuses that some of the time.
Even if you are not going to WCCC I want people who are even somewhat close to local to me. So sorry for the length but the side panel is too small for my list of what I'm into so check the list at the below. If any of it sounds like your kinda stuff talk to me.
Al's Interests:
Music (From Ol' blue eyes to Rob Zombie soundtracks to Eminem I listen to it all)
Sherlock Holmes almost anything (not elementary nope just no)
Monty Python (I will quote holy grail)
Yugioh the original and season zero as well as the card game
Hellsing both mangas and both shows
Yu Yu Hakusho 
Dragon Ball and Z
Pokemon card game and original show (I adored Misty's Psyduck)
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and Space
Wolf's Rain
Marvel older comics and now the movies (bring the universe all back together pllllleeeease)
DC (I'm a picky about them. Linda Carter, BTAS, The REAL Teen Titans, ask for more if you want)
Disney (You no like Disney, dishonor on your whole family....)
History (ancient, oriental, victorian, WW2 I wish more people cared about it)
Books (Beast was my favorite prince because he gave belle a library.)
Photography (I'm learning it)
Cosplay (great form of tribute to characters)
Mythbusters (I wasn't ready for it to end)
Real Looney Toons
Tons of others too I can't think to name right now. No Harry Potter, Twilight or Doctor Who sorry just not my thing.
Come on! You read this far I got to be interesting to you. Reply to me.

I'm mid twenties and polyamorous looking to add another partner to my life but this time I want someone specific. 

You should be 21-40ish, non smoker, kind, well kept and submissive. You must have some day time availability during the week. You must be okay with poly/open relationships and be willing to have thorough safer sex talk. 

I want to find a partner who is wanting a female led relationship. 
I would make all the decisions. You would run errands with me or for me. You would wash my laundry and maintain my apartment. You would give me massages. You would give me (mostly) unreciprocated pleasure. You would want to worship my body. 

I'm looking for someone who wants this to be an ongoing relationship with the opportunity to build intimacy. I'd prefer someone who also wants a romantic relationship. 

Other aspects of BDSM can be negotiated and included. 

If interested please respond thoughtfully and thoroughly including things like your age and location, your availability, your experience with FLR or BDSM. MUST include a photo. I'd highly prefer a face photo.

Good afternoon :)
Sweet and compassionate chica here looking for a fun caring guy to add discipline to my life.. hopefully youll think im cute already but ultimately agree id b sexier without my belly.

Ive been fluffy forever. And tho i love my thick thighs and big bouncy breasts, 
I need someone to whip me into shape, help me slim my waist using corsetry, exercise routines and strict diet. 
Someone who'll reward me for reaching goals and punish me for sneaking ice cream in the middle of the night. Not cause they want to hurt me, but rather teach me better ways n break me of my bad habits. 

Ideally your fitness is already in check and you would enjoy to put in time at the gym with me and choose what kind of workouts i should do n for how long. 

I suppose like a personal trainer but with a personal stake in it. Im your project. You want me to be prime for you to enjoy.. 

In return i surrender myself to you. Whatever you need is my bidding as you shape me along the way. 

If you can fulfill this or have better ideas along this line, i beg you to please respond. 

So i can avoid bots please use subject: surrender.

Do you have a tendency to blurt things out? Were you absent the day they passed out filters? Do you ever reflect on things you've said or done while you were ""just kidding"" or ""just partying""? 
Have you accused someone of creeping or stalking, even as you patrol their work and home, and keep tabs on their social media? You know if you've done this. 
Have you interfered in friend or work relationships just because you knew how? Do you ever discuss your own behavior, or do you focus on what others are doing/not doing? 
Have you insulted others for your entertainment? How do you respond if it happens to you? 
Do you have a wandering eye? Do you comment on sexual aspects of most people? Do you question the loyalty of anyone you're ""with"" who makes these kinds of comments? Do you try and ""catch"" those who care about you doing something wrong? Do you do anything wrong (even if you don't admit it)?
Do you have secret emails, secret phone numbers, secret identities, secret ""friends"", secret hobbies, etc? Do you demand 100% access to all of these things from those you're seeing?
Do you think there's a difference between ""just sex"" and ""cheating""? Do you have the same flexible standards with others? Is a one night stand ok if you're drunk or high? Is it ok if no one knows about it? 
Do you find yourself concocting stories, but expect 100% honesty from others? 
None of this stuff is particularly right or wrong. People do whatever they want. Situational ethics are there, and we use them. You don't build a bond that way. Maybe you don't want a bond. That's ok too. I'll keep my distance. 
I can be quite the introvert, and I like my privacy. Hovering shows lack of trust, whether it's your boss or a friend. 
There will be times I disappear, and that's to your benefit. I'm probably tired or stressed or ready to punch you in the face for your stupid double standards. Leave me alone for awhile. 
I value and need all kinds of things. Intimacy and touch are key. Could be sex. Could be holding hands. Could be your presence during a difficult time. 
I like to check out new places and learn new things. I might go the whole day without talking, or I might never shut up. It depends on the day. I tell stories about people and things that make me laugh. Sometimes I'm sad or emotional about people I miss, or things that have changed. 
I'm not a daredevil. There are things that scare the crap out of me. Bungee jumping and heights tend to make me want to vomit. Do what you need to do. I'll be shaking in my boots until I see you again. I will try not to vomit. 
My son in law went sky diving for his birthday. I was pretty sure he'd lost his damn mind, but it's his to lose. 
I feel no rush about anything these days, and that's pretty nice. Rushing has gotten me in plenty of trouble. 
There's a difference between caring and controlling. Those two get mixed up all the time. I care, and I want you to be ok. And you make your own path. 
I have a ton of loyalty and affection to offer. I'm selective. If you do things to test or hurt me, I'll get over it. But they'll stay on my mind. If the same treatment toward you would cause a blow out, shit storm, WWIII, maybe that's something to consider. Just saying. 
You want to be understood and respected? Don't we all? If you're off the market, own up to it. If you're looking for a side chick, own it. If you have no idea what you're looking for, that's fine too. Maybe you just need an ear. I'm happy to draw lines if I have any idea of where they go.

*** must respond with a few paragraphs not just photos please--

Wanna go for lunch and a walk? Or just lunch if we can't really click as friends nor romantic interests???

Ok --I am trying to be vegan. Not plant based -- I really feel as a global human family we should not be eating animals. I am actually intending on opening a place to serve vegan food so I can always eat vegan. 

Ok so- it's important to me that you want to become vegan-- or you are vegan. So don't flag me if you think asking for a vegan guy is flag worthy. Just give a busy mom a chance to find a like minded guy who is also feeling the Bern : )

Yoga- meditation - hiking - Netflix - Feng Shui- live music from 1930s jazz to alternative 80s music to Tina Malia. 

If you have any ideas about best places to eat in SF -Marin to Sonoma county - Mill Valley to Healdsburg - let me know--- those with a good vegan portion of the menu ---- let me know - new to north bay and still part time in SF (21 years in SF )

If you read this entire ad- tell me where you went to school and if you are doing what you always wanted to do for a living. : )

Happy spring!

Honestly, I don't know why I'm even posting here or how I even got here. But since I am, I figure I might as well tell you what I want... I would like to find an attractive, funny, spontaneous, driven and successful man. If you're not these things, please do not respond back to me. I simply want to hangout and enjoy some good company, if it leads to more then so be it.
I know my worth and I have absolutely no problem getting men or women in real life. I'm intelligent, beautiful, funny as shit and very ambitious. 
I think it's just much easier to communicate my wants this way without all the other bullshit.

So I have decided to take a different approach... I am looking for a business partner with benefits per se... I need help building my website, a photographer... someone young and up on this social media... I am spending all my time working on this and just thought how nice it would be to have some help...

So let's start this off slow and see if there is a connection. I am a tall older Black woman that is very 420 friendly... a working pot head... I enjoy going to festivals and wine tastings,,, dancing and dining are favorite activities and would be some of the benefits to working with me. My age is my business for now but I hope you are up for the challenge to be my fountain of youth!
Are you ready to have serious dialogue on how we can help each other? I am single and I prefer you to be single too. I hate that cougar label so let's say this is my new fantasy...Not your sugar mama but if you have some of the skills needed and want to play, let's meet soon. We can be discreet... 
Tell me about yourself... why you think you are what I need... I love the art of seduction so keep your weenies in your pants for now! Let's blaze or vape together and work on an EMPIRE!!

Are there any awesome guys left out there who truly want to settle down and start the next phase of their life with that special someone?

Perhaps you men out there are thinking the same thing about women.:)

I'm mostly attracted to white males. Please be in this age range only 35-40.

Maturity, sensitivity,attentiveness, and a caring nature are what I'm looking for.

It's also important that the person cares about their health.

Major turnoff are selfishness, arrogance, and self centeredness.

I am a nice person, and I expect the person I'm with to encompass all the positive qualities I mentioned. It also helps to have a sense of humor and a willingness to talk things out. I can admit when I'm wrong, and I expect that the other person can do the same. No one is always right, and no one is always wrong.

I'm about 5""5, with light brown hair and blue eyes. I am in descent shape because I do workout. 

I truly am looking to settle down. I hope that whoever reads this is looking for the same thing.

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, in which city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

So I was feeling sentimental when tickets for this show went on sale and bought a pair right away, turns out most of my friends aren't feeling so sentimental and aren't really interested in going, so I thought I'd see if there's some one out there who may be inclined to go see this show too. 

Since it's a seated show, I'd like to know a little bit more about you, as hopefully you can make for some interesting conversation between sets (Liz Phair opening) and are somewhat easy on the eyes. 

That said, a bit about me. . . SWF in my 40s, I like to see live music but don't do so nearly as often as I used to compared to when I was in my 20s. I like all the usual SF things like being outdoorsy (cycling, hiking), eating at the city's numerous restaurants, doing cultural things like museums, indie movies, local weekend and faraway international travels. 

Ticket has been paid for and is a sunk cost at this point, but you could be a gentleman and get the drinks at the show (and who knows, if we click maybe after too).

Hello. Thanks for clicking here.

I am a young at heart 48 year old with tons of friends and family. I seek fun, laughs, and honest times. I was married for 10 years (many years ago, no baggage, no scars!) and have no kids (just never happened, but adore playing Auntie to tons of kids). I grew up in a big Irish Michigan family, then after college lived in DC, NYC, and now the SF Bay Area. I am grateful for my midwest roots and adopted east coast mentality (sweet but direct, NO BS).

My interest are varied. I am open and curious about so many things. Love exploring new local places and exotic travel. Enjoy all artsy things like museums, music, festivals. Plus I truly like sports and attending games more than the average girl. Mostly, I just like to keep busy and am able to end the day with a ""Wow. That was a good day!""

What am I looking for? Simply, a good guy! You know, the type who automatically reaches to helps an old person, opens a door, smiles at a stranger. Plus call me old fashion, but I like traditional dating. So if you like my ad, write back, let's exchange photos and a few brief emails, and then ask me out if you are interested. 

I went to a super fun party last night and was told too many times ""Why don't you have a boyfriend???"" So today, I am trying to answer that question. I hope to hear from someone special. For some reason, it's been a long time since I dated someone seriously but I am open to meeting a great guy who has some time for a fun, good gal. Let's enjoy Spring (and beyond) together.

-Molly

It's been some time, since I've met a guy to lay with. ;-)

Don't worry, I'm not to the point where I could take it or leave it.
I WANT it!
But, not with just anyone. Sex is way too important for that!

I'm not looking to knock down forever right now, but would like to one day meet an awesome guy who I click with and who has my back and I, his!

If you're into finding something regular and someone to hang out with, (meals, river, drives, eventually...your place) that works for me!

Please be 38-52, non-cig-smoker, not a lush, or into heavy drugs of any kind. Unattached and within 20 miles. Those are my deal breakers.

I'm attracted to smart, tall, handsome white guys. Im not into kissing scruffy beards or a guy with a big belly.

Hope you're enjoying the rain and your weekend.

No, I would never do this in real life. However I'm interested in the vulnerability and trust this type of relationship would require. I'm looking for a relationship with someone who is as into this as I am, and looking for a connection as well as role play. Please be single and open minded.

It's a lazy Sunday and I'm not feeling the best so I decided to kill some time browsing CL. I have to confess, I was a bit surprised, but in a good way. Found a post from a man that specifically stated he had all his teeth, which made me laugh. I mean, that's a great quality to have - is that rare on CL? Saw another ad posted by a man looking for a woman who loves cunnilingus - understandable. I would be very surprised if he was not inundated with responses. 

I wonder how many people actually meet through this site. I've tried online dating without much success, unfortunately. Sometimes it seems like online dating makes it harder to meet someone because you are sorting through countless profiles to find that perfect one who may or may not exist. 

I hope that the people who have posted do find the responses they are looking for. I miss that human interaction too - when you first meet someone you have chemistry with. The butterflies, the kissing, the excitement and hopefulness...I don't really know why I am making this post; it was just nice to see real posts from real people.

ometimes I feel like the day is just drags on and it would be nice to have someone to talk to and joke around with. 

I tend to make dorky and dirty jokes, but i'm crazy shy when it comes to sex lol

I am open to video chat, but I won't show you nudies or stext you, its just not my cup of tea. 

I love cooking and am open to sharing recipes, life experiences, advice, etc..

I'm just looking for someone I can just talk to that won't judge me, someone I can tell all my dirty little secrets to. JK 

But seriously, I'm not looking to hook up or anything of that sort. I'm trying to figure out who I am and I find sex seems to always complicate everything, so it would be nice to take it out of the equation and just have a friend/companion. 

If you're looking for the something similar email me with your number and lets talk. (if you're not cool with that then don't email lol, don't waste my time and i won't waste yours :D )

Let's see dating in, just not what it was back in the day when I was a young kid, LOL.

I am single mom in my mid 30's, looking for someone to share my life with.
I am pretty laid back I like to have fun in my life, I am a huge movie buff, I like bowling, camping, shooting, always looking to try new things. I am a great cook, I am great with a grill myself.

I only have one child, I am not looking to have more to be very honest. I work full time, have my own place my own car. I don't have a criminal background lol

I am 420 friendly, I drink from time to time but it's not often

What I am looking for is a guy like myself, someone laid back, someone who likes to have fun but also works and has his life together. A single dad would be fantastic

I don't have drama with Ex relationships that's over and done.

As for my looks since that is a huge thing, I am a BBW, a fat woman whatever you men like to call it. I am tattooed, Long hair, white, take care of myself by myself in general in life.

I am not looking for a hook up or a FWB, I am looking to date and get to know someone and see where it goes. Once it gets to the physical point I do have a high, (too high I have been told) sex drive, so looking for someone that can match when it gets there.

I am looking for a guy close to my age, in your 30's would be awesome
Please send me any email lets talk, If you send me a picture that would be awesome. But don't just send me an email asking for mine if you aren't willing to share yours.

I'm a 36yo Filipina with too much free time on her hands. Well, aside from my job, and being caretaker for my dad.

I'm looking for someone to chat with, get to know, share a few interests with; if things click between us it may turn into something more; I'm open to the idea. If not, at least we've become friends. 

I have been told I'm upbeat, hilarious, kind and loyal. I'm a bit reserved at other times, probably because I like to stay neutral. As in I always like to see and understand both sides of the issues at hand. 

I look pretty average, although my ex swears that I look cute, especially around the eyes. I dress tomboyish (because it's comfortable), but can clean up nice depending on the occasion.

I like watching anime, Asian dramas, and comedies. My tastes in music are all over the place, though my current favorites are Kpop and 90s R&B. I do appreciate jazz, since I've played saxophone as a teen. I'm a bit of a foodie, so I like checking out different cuisines/restaurants as well as trying out different recipes. Yes, I can cook. I am a trained artist (and have the BFA to prove it).

So I guess this is the part where I mention what I want in a guy friend. The ideal one would be either Asian or white, hwp, fairly good looking, under 40, share some of the same interests, and at least have their act together. They would also be kind, caring, considerate, positive, and loyal. Most importantly, they don't play games; the last time I posted this the guy who responded decided to see someone else while leading me on. Not cool.

So if you're interested please email me, and we'll see where this goes. Your pic gets mine. And to prove you're real and not a bot, put your favorite fruit in the subject line. (Mine's lychee.)

Thanks for looking. :)

Hello! I am looking to find a bi guy (40-52) to date and see how we click for a long term relationship. (If you are not bi that's ok .. I'm just seeing who's out there.) I am quite open-minded and would need you to be too, as I use a wheelchair. I am very caring, educated, self-sufficient (work), drive, very sensual, petite, youthful, quiet/reserved with a sometimes goofy and sometimes wild side, love animals, and love to laugh. I like being around goal-oriented people. I long for a relationship based on mutual respect, and lots of fun including weekend getaways. I spent most of my life in SoCal and have been in NorCal past 10 years. I currently live a couple hours northeast of Vallejo but love to drive (and can work from anywhere via phone/internet). I am open to moving for the right guy (unless he wants to move to where I am). If interested, let's talk and exchange pics and see how we mesh. I look forward to hearing from you!

Guys have asked me ""why bi?"" I just think it's hot watching two guys together. It's not something I want on a daily basis, but now and then would be fun. And again, you don't have to be bi. I just thought it'd be fun to see what the possibilities are. And no, I'm not really bi myself.

In your reply, please save us both time and tell me about you including your age and interests (other than sex). Just to be clear, I am not on here for casual; I am seeking a new partner. Thanks!

Hello :) 

....................... ☔️

I am very down to earth and at a good place in my life. I am so ready for someone who is genuine and real... so if this fits you so far... please continue. I don't frequent bars and don't get out much... I am usually at work, at the track .. or with my kids... so thought this would be a good way to find someone. I love just about anything and if I haven't tried it before, I will give it a whirl... 

I appreciate the small things in life and never ever take anything for granted. I am as honest as they come and don't know how to be any other way. I want to find my best friend this time! I'm too old for games or liars... I am very open, spontaneous, (however I do like to plan things out too).

If you are married, looking for a FWB or looking to meet a woman who doesn't have children, kindly move on.

I am a WF, late 30's, looking to find someone with like interests to hang out and have fun with. For my physical appearance, I am 5'4"", blonde hair, green eyes, curvy and thick (but not fat). My interests are anything outdoors, reading, traveling, trying new things and just enjoying life. I am looking for someone located in the South Bay, 30's/40's, educated, tall, can hold a decent conversation and wants to have fun. Please send a face picture, I will not respond to body part pictures. I am real and ask that you be to, not into playing games.

I want to live, I want to give.
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
It's these expressions I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold,
And I'm getting old.

Neil Young's words capture how I feel about finding a man who -- like me -- has a heart of gold.

If you're the one I seek, you're a kind, compassionate, caring gentleman between the ages of 60 and 75 who lives close enough to me so we can play together frequently. I'm hoping you share these qualities that describe me: educated, intelligent, and articulate; energetic and engaged; a non-smoker (of tobacco) but appreciator of wine, spirits, and the herb (all in moderation); financially stable and socially progressive.

Physically, I am of average height and weight (5'4""/~138 lbs.), and considered pretty/attractive...but attraction is personal. While I appreciate lifestyle differences, I'm best matched with a man who -- like me -- is Caucasian, monogamous, and omnivorous. I am interested only in men who are legally and emotionally available -- i.e., single, divorced, or widowed, and not currently partnered.

If you would like to start a conversation, I hope you'll reply to tell me about yourself and why you think we might be a good match. Be sure to include your age and location, and attach a photo. I am happy to reciprocate if we seem well matched.

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, in which city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

Looking to meet someone new... there's a couple movies out I'd like to try and catch sometime soon... I'm just looking to make new friends to hang out with, but if it leads to it, a cuddle buddy for cold nights would be awesome... someone to talk to about our days and vent our frustrations.



I am most attracted to military type, tall (at least a few inches taller than myself), men who appreciate thick Asian women. Yes, attraction is important for both parties, but I see attraction as a whole... believe me when I say personality and sincerity counts for a lot. If I can't have a stimulating conversation with you, it just won't work out.

I am in my early 30s , Asian, a lil under 5'6"" thereabouts, thick n curvy, with very short hair. Educated, good balance between being mature and responsible and being silly. Love to smile and make others laugh. I do have a somewhat sarcastic humor but am usually pretty shy when I first get to know someone. Fascinated by and love to learn about different cultures and languages.

I would prefer to meet people a few years older than myself (not older than late 30s please). Current or former military a plus. NON-smokers, 420 included (Sorry... I am sensitive to smell.)



Please tell me a bit about yourself and send a (recent, no older than 3 months - yes, I can tell) clear face pic if interested. I will return same should it seem like it would work out. 1-2 liners will not get a response. (NO PIC NO RESPONSE!)  I would venture out into the rain for the right person.. ^_^



I'm just looking for an activity buddy at first but open to more if the chemistry is there. If not, we'll go our separate ways.



PS: Please know the difference between your and you're...and know when to use which!

Serious about my preferences, and that does include age.

Latina, 41 in search of my Super Nerdy (White) Hero.

The things I would like out of this special friendship are, someone that I can connect with physically as well as intellectually. Someone I can have deep meaningful conversations to the lightest with! :) Someone to laugh and cry with. Share everything and anything, at full trust! Our secrets and only ours! Like special friends, soul mates... We can hangout, go out for lunch or dinner, have picnics, go for walks, hikes, travel/seek adventure, people watch, go to movies, or stay in, cook for each other, or together, teach me how to play videos games if you are a gamer?? =D haha. Put a flower in your head..or two! :) Be silly or cheesy together... cuddle, love each other. Simply just be together whenever we feel like, whenever life allows us to. I would like to find someone that I can care for and love, and in return do the the same for me. My heart is big and I would like to share it with someone special. It can be whatever we want it to be, as long as it is something meaningful.

I have been described by men as beautiful, cute, sexy, fun, funny, sweet and caring. To describe myself, I am caring, compassionate, passionate, hopeless romantic, sentimental, silly at times, but know when to be serious. I am a strong woman who can be vulnerable at times and I am not ashamed to say so. I have my flaws and I am very aware of them. They have helped me to learn and grow, better myself. They have made me the strong woman I am today, more and more each day. I am, simply put, a bubbly introvert.

I am attracted to younger men and they have always been attracted to me. We have always felt comfortable with each other, a special connection. I have been told I make them feel free, unleashed! And I too have always felt the same.

My preference is between the ages of mid 30's to early 40's. I am attracted to slender build (average, depending on what you define average as. Haha), shy, introverted (I find this trait rather sweet, cute, attractive!), white/Caucasian guys, fair skinned with light eyes. Green, blue... No tattoos (well actually...It depends. How big are we talking and how many??). I am sorry, but it's what I like, and I have a right to my preference. It is what it is! As you have a right to yours! Please put your eye color in the subject line so I'll know you read my preferences.

I have really bad scars from an accident I had as a child. **The photo is a picture of an ex model turned burnsurvivor named Turia Pitt. ** I read about her story and how her relationship was able to pull through the trauma of her accident. Although it's a bit of a reach for me, I am hopeful that despite the absence of the right guy, its possible for me too. 

So coupled with the outcome of my injury and growing up in a conservative household, I consider myself a bit of a late bloomer. The scars on my face are my biggest regret because as you can imagine people's stares aren't always kind. So in anticipation of eye contact, I tend to look away. Trust me, I'm working on it and it's getting better with time. 

My personality is adaptable. In many instances like work and school, I'm a social butterfly and a relatively confident person. But when it comes to social environments where I'm meeting people who aren't familiar with me and especially where dating or flirting happens, I tend to flounder and not know what to do... While this seems like a venting session, I'd like to hope there's someone who's out there who can relate and or want to get to know me, despite the obvious challenges I'm getting over.

I have made some strides in the dating area, I guess. The other day I met someone I was chatting with from tinder and it went fine. We met once after a few days and then another time after a few weeks of talking. I just don't think it's going anywhere because subtle things indicated that he didn't respect me or my time... I'll leave it at that. But for some reason a few days after the second meet up we just stopped checking in. Despite that upset, I did learn through that experience that in spite of feeling singled out and unlovable; I realized how many, if not all people sometimes feel that way. 

Simply put by a bar buddy I met at the Continental Dinner while waiting forty-five minutes for my date to arrive (oops, I said I wouldn't get into that), the buddy said we all have scars and experience trauma. Its just that some of your scars show on the outside. As simple and obvious as that may seem, it meant the world to me to feel that even for a second, I wasn't as different as my appearance and interactions lead me to sometimes feel and believe. Needless to say, I'm working on myself but am certainly not a push over (so you preying wolf, stay away!) 

If you're interested in getting to know someone like myself and maybe hangout, shoot me a message by telling me about yourself and attach a picture of yourself. Here's some of the things I hope you're like:

I'm 30, cute, somewhat shy, and 5""11 ft tall! I have long wavy brown hair, hazel green eyes, and nice lips, and somewhat curvy. I doubt I'll find what I'm looking for on here, but figured I'd give CL a try.

I'm a nurse living in the sf bay area seeking a relationship with a SWM or Latino man also in the medical field, preferably a doctor or nurse in the 28-37 age range. You don't have to look like an athlete, but at least be in reasonably good shape (a little chubby is fine, but not fat). I'm not seeking a serious relationship right now, but am looking for friendship and casual dating. Maybe it will turn into something more, who knows? What I'm NOT interested in is a texting relationship. I actually want to physically meet you in PERSON! A few emails or texts are fine, but I don't want to be your texting buddy. I don't know why, but I've experienced this a lot from guys on dating sites who do this. I want to actully have a cup of coffee with you or go somewhere fun! 

Picture for picture.

PS: post your favorite color in the subject line of your email so I know it's not spam, otherwise your message will be deleted.

I have no idea what I'm doing on here. I'll just be honest and say that I'm married & in a ""roommate"" situation right now. I have so much to give and offer a lover. I feel like I'm missing out in life by not being able to share my sexuality with someone. I go to bed alone every night dreaming of intimacy. 

My situation isn't going to change anytime soon. I don't want to bang a dozen men weekly, rather have an ongoing mutually respective and honest sex life. Honesty and respect is the absolute most important. You need to know the difference between their, they're and there... Please be witty and funny and down to earth. Sometimes the verbal banter is much more a turn on than looks. I am drawn to tall, dark & handsome but it's not required.

About me: 

Very pretty SWF, size 4, a looker! 
Professional / advanced degrees 
Avid runner 
Yoga practitioner 
Love all things pink and purple 

My smile and eyes are my most prominent and attractive features 
I love the woods 
I love staying up late and seeing the dawn, lazy Sundays in bed with you 

I love to have fun and cut up with someone special - once a special relationship has been established 
Trying to teach myself Italian (slow process) 

A smart, quick thinking man is the ultimate turn-on for me 
I am delightful, delicious, demure, even dainty, subtle, sweet, sexy. 

The type of man I seek: 
I am seeking a successful, confident, and intelligent SWM, 56-72, who knows how to enjoy life. 
A man who will break his routine and try something new, or maybe try something new that he did not enjoy 7 years ago, 
like to learn a new language, a new dance, a new sport (i.e. - cross-country skiing). 

I am seeking a man who is looking for one woman to be his partner - a man who wants a longterm companion to engage in discovery with. 
Prefer a SWM who is well-educated (grad. degrees), sensitive and moved by nature, animals and the arts, a gentleman, kind to everyone 
(including waiters :-), 
successful in his chosen profession and he should still be excited about his professional work. 

Note - a man who dreads his work would not be a good match for me. 

Important - you must be truly single - not separated or married. Age IS important - I look very young - but I am Not attracted to young men. 
I am interested in meeting a SWM between the ages of 56-72. 

An interesting letter and your photo will turn my head and increase the chances that we meet. 
Please respond with a descriptive letter. Picture a Must for a response.

Hey guys!

I'm 30 years old and pretty laid back. I am seeking someone to have fun adventures with. I'm not seeking a relationship. If by chance, it turns into something more, I'm not opposed. But I'm not looking for a boyfriend or a ring right now. 

Let's go on an adventure, go shopping for things we don't need in ChinaTown, let's eat some great food and have some laughs.

I'm not your girl next door type. Maybe I'm the girl 3 doors down. I have a sarcastic sense of humor, I curse too much and don't care, I can rock heels as well as I can rock Converse and I have a few tattoos. 

You: must be open and have a sense of humor. No boring dudes - PLEASE. 

Email me if and shoot me a photo and a bit about yourself. 


Happy hunting!

I used to think that, as an overweight woman, all I had to offer was my personality (which is pretty awesome sauce) but it turns out that I am also a sex object. Who knew? Now I can't wait to have a man use me for my brain.

I am probably most men's worst nightmare because I want a serious relationship. I don't need to walk down the aisle in a fluffy white dress, but I would like to get married at some point. I am not interested in having kids of my own, but if you have them, that is fine with me. So, I won't put any pressure on you to do these things NOW, but you have to see a commitment with someone in your future in order to get a response from me. 

I am a professional woman with a demanding career. I am ambitious and I take my work, but not myself, very seriously. I only work 40 hours a week, and I have many hobbies, so I am achieving some kind of work-life balance. I am looking for a partner who wants to make plans with me, but also wants to succeed in work and explore his interests. I will give you space, but it would be nice to know that you miss me sometimes.

If you are a mature and educated man, with a serious relationship in mind, I would love to hear from you. Sense of humor is really important to me, and I tend to be the funnier person in the relationship, but I would love for you to show me up. 

I have posted before but never seem to connect with anyone long-term. Follow through is important. I am a woman of action looking for a man of action.

Hey! Thanks for clicking on my ad.

About me; I'm 21, almost 22 and going to school full-time. I work in retail and am able to support myself decently well. I also have a car so getting to ya/places isn't a major concern. I really love to read, cook, go to metal and punk concerts, watch horror movies, read Marvel, go fishing, hiking and camping. Physically, I'm 5'7"", medium/long strawberry blonde hair, blue eyes, thick hourglass who takes care of myself well. I'm std clean, drug-free and enjoy my beer once in awhile. 

What I'm looking for; I am looking for a man who appreciates and loves a curvy, thicker figure (tolerates is different than loves, keep that in mind). Must want something more then just sex. Sorry! I don't do hookups. Has conversation skills, good work ethic, similar interests or willing to try new things and is a genuinely kind person to not only me but everyone else too. Please be between the ages of 20 and 30. I might go a little higher in age, but that would take some convincing. Also, please be single, drug-free, std free and not a raging alcoholic (Hey! A little fun is always needed but there's a fine line). Finally, must love dogs.

Champagne and rose are romantically fine
This princess can enjoy them at any time
Dinner and dancing, champagne brunches
Chocolates and kisses are very good lunches

Starry eye and giddy is a good way to feel
Aptos, Santa Cruz and sunny beaches make it all real
Night time or day time is a great for long talks
Mountains and parks are good for long walks.
If you are dependable, generous and ready for fun
Call this princess to share an iced mocha under the sun

This princess is neat and particular about all that ado
She wants a prince who's well groomed, neat and particular too.

Look no further this princess will be your dove

That's great if you're looking for your soulmate, by tomorrow lol, but not for just finding awesome people to hang out with and see where it goes. I'm a fairly laid back California native, and I'm just looking for someone to hang out with that won't be a super stalker or wants to pick out a wedding venue on the 3rd date. I mean, that's like a 6th date conversation, maybe 7th, lol. So kidding ;-) I refuse to believe chivalry is dead and I'm sure there has to be a guy out there who wants to join me on activities similar to these: random adventures into SF, day trips to the beach or lakes/river etc, drinking a little too much wine and watching a funny movie, or just hanging out at home cooking up something amazing for dinner. Good cuddlers and amazing huggers are encouraged to apply :-) I'm the anti-chick in that I'm not looking for something super serious from the first email exchange we will have. I just want to connect with someone and find someone who enjoys my company as much as I enjoy theirs. All I ask is that you are: not a tobacco smoker, not married or otherwise romantically involved, gainfully employed, not looking for a hookup, somewhat around my age (around 24-38 but not super picky about it), taller than me is preferable, not more than 30 min away from Walnut Creek, and real. Please include a pic and change the subject to ""Partner in Crime"" to weed out spam. Please only email if you are really interested in getting to know me and hanging out. Anyways, thanks for reading and I hope to hear from you soon!

Nerdy and Sophisticated Gentleman for Spring fun.

I would like to meet a cool companion for spring time outing to explore the Bay Area and cultural outings such as wine tasting in Napa or a round of golf or tennis or sailing.

He is very well-educated, athletic and fit, love of nature and literature, good cooking, play tennis and or golf, fond of classical music and a concert goer in SF.

Having said that, I think meeting a like-minded person and who is within a similar age range would be practical to develop a long term friendship for outdoorsy activities and reading and listening classical music.

I am attracted someone that is intellectual, smart, fit and athletic, enjoys one outdoor sport, classy, and into cultural activities such concerts and stimulating conversation.

To be practical, that someone special is within a similar age range 46-53 y/o, and is currently single.

I'm politically progressive, well-rounded person with diverse interests in performing art and science.
I like someone that is a well-listener and patient and has a professional career with a happy outlook on life. Are you with a lighter baggage that you have more time for the romantic relationship?

The answer is yes, please respond with some introduction about yourself and a recent photo.

Cheers.

Hello,

I am on here to find a guy for a relationship, not a casual fling. I have a successful career, and would like to find a guy in a similar situation. I enjoy travel and being active. I like combining the two when on vacation. I am a little bit of a science nerd so that is probably a little different than most girls on here. I love SF, just not the dating scene! I'm 5'7"" with dark brown hair. I don't smoke but I do love wine. Although cutting a little bit back on that front during the week. This weather is great and looking forward to jumping back on my bike. I like cooking and have friends over for dinner parties when I can find the time. I love all types of cuisines and hopefully you do too!

That is enough for now, let me know if you have an interest in learning more.

Basics about me: Single white female. Yes I do live in Oakland. No I am not from here, but it is where I call home. Educated. Employed. Independent. Dog lover. No children. Not voting for Trump.

Specifics about me: 5'2"". Blonde hair. Brown eyes. Body type is what the internet has labeled BBW. For anyone who needs to know, that means I am a heavy girl. 

What I am looking for: Someone to get to know and build a relationship with if we have good chemistry.

What I am NOT looking for: Someone to have a one night stand, booty-call or FWB type of situation with. Also not expecting to have an instant relationship. 

Yes I am real. It is 1:22 am (I cannot sleep). The weather was decent today, but it rained ALL day on Sunday.

Loving is easy. It is being loved that is the great challenge - allowing that feeling coming from someone elses entire body to get beneath your skin and penetrate down to your bone marrow where you can be known and you can be changed. A challenge you cannot meet or even imagine unobserved and by yourself.

THE HUNGER

I knocked at your door
but you were at the window, looking up the road waiting for your true love to appear.
I stood beneath your window and sang the sweetest serenade
but you were in the garden, battling the bees for the most beautiful flower to offer her when she arrived.
I picked the lock on your garden gate
but you were in the kitchen bullying the cook into preparing the most perfect amorous feast.
When you died it was said that you choked on the bone of a lark
dining alone.

Are you ready?

I'm not a hopeless romantic, not sentimental, not shy, not drama queen, and probably not sweet. So, if you looking for a sweet babe - it's not me. 

I'm realistic but optimistic, opinionated but polite, positive, empathetic but not into a pity party, strong, full of energy and enthusiasm, adventurous but not foolhardy, intelligent and educated. I'm white 46 years old, attractive, and fit. I take care of myself, and have a healthy life style. I prefer outdoor activities - hikes, walks, travel. TV, movies, video games are only for the rainy days, however I would prefer meaningful conversations, and good books. What else? I love to cook, and I do it well. I'm sensual and feminine. I'm very loyal friend.

Who am I looking for? Confident, with good manners man, physically fit, bright, intelligent, with sense of humor, and stable career. Someone who is able to have deep meaningful conversations. Friend, lover, soul mate. Between 40 to 50 years old. Tall. Smart. Empathetic. Single or divorced. 

For the first date I would prefer quiet place where we can talk, walk, or hike, but I'm not into eating high-calories food or spending hours in a dark theater without a single dialogue. I also don't want to know all cheesy details about your former relationships, and I don't provide therapy sessions. 

Are you game?

Originally from New York, I have been living in California since 1998. I do keep myself busy with my own career (I can sometimes work from home) but also have time and will make an effort for the right man who makes time for me. I am seeking a Caucasian man who is between the ages of 48 - 58.

I am not really a world traveler and like being close to home, but will travel a little. I guess you would call me more of a homebody. I do, however, love to learn about new places, people and cultures.

I'm the mother of two grown daughters who are off at college. I am divorced. I'm very down to earth, I think, easy to get along with. I listen more than I talk.  I like to read a lot and keep up with many things--politics, social issues, culture, travels, people. I am also an animal lover, especially dogs. I really hate disrespectful people. 

I especially value humor, being able to laugh at yourself, being able to communicate, (VERY IMPORTANT). If you are the type of man who I have to guess what is on your mind, please move on. I am much too old and mature to play any type of head games and you also must know what you want.

I also like Alfred Hitchcock, psychological thrillers (not the gory, hack'em, slash'em films), , hearing people's stories, and simply talking with someone who really wants to know me and does not judge. I'm looking for a companion--someone with his own life, I do not get along with strong personalities, so please be easygoing, gentle and kind towards animals, people. You are the type of man who would hold a door open for a stranger or help a stranger out if you see them with a flat tire on the side of the road. You are able to make the compromises that life sometimes requires. Someone who isn't too thin, is comfortable with their own body (You do not have to be a male model type), and who is able to laugh at himself. No smokers, please. No drugs, please. A man who does not live in the gym. No pictures will be swapped as I must get to know the inside of you, rather than the outside first. I DO understand there must be a physical attraction, but that comes later, (sorry if you don't agree, we will not get along). I am NOT looking for a purely physical encounter. There must be a emotional connection or a strong enough connection for me to share my pics over the internet.

You must be open and be able to talk about anything., good and bad. With so many people in the world today, and especially the scammers on Craigslist, I am truly hoping that I find someone for me, willing to take the time, but not rush things and I am also willing to open my heart again ( I have done this before and got hurt). I truly believe in love and that there is truly someone out there for everyone. You just have to have the bravery to find YOUR someone that truly makes you a better person. You must believe that if there is such a person in your life and you have that connection, etc., you are not afraid to take the next step and eventually get married. No serial daters, please. 

Let me get this straight too, I am NOT looking for a husband right away, it takes time to get to know one another, but looking for a true soulmate, someone who really wants to be with me, gets me and really want the emotional, the physical (eventually) and not be afraid to let go of old baggage and move on with your life. Even though, I have grown children, men who have children do not scare me. Thanks for reading and I hope someone out there will take this as serious as I do, but with a hint of humor too.

A Bit About Me

A desert wildflower has stopped me in my tracks. So has anything that makes me laugh, a grizzly bear in Alaska, a perfect vocal harmony, a stunning panel of petroglyphs in Utah, a flock of thousands of snow geese in the air at dawn, a snappily written paragraph, a grove of redwoods, and the wonderful company of good friends. I'm passionate about life and eager to learn from it. I want to be passionate about you, too, as my partner for the rest of our days.

I'm a professional do-gooder, involved in environmental and science education and sustainability. Previously I taught kids outdoors as a park ranger and naturalist (no, not a naturist until I get to know you better) and these days I'm a nonprofit environmental fundraiser. I also am active in issues of equality around race, gender and economic status. I volunteer as a peer counselor on a hotline. While I take helping others and bettering the world seriously, I'm also a goofball known to dance in the living room.

I'm big-hearted and small-bodied. I wear my heart on my sleeve but not make-up. Words and writing captivate me--obviously, since I do go on and on here. I'm a lifelong learner and enjoy reading about multiple subjects. I thrive on touch and affection. I love being silly and playful, and laugh easily and frequently. I buy organic and local whenever possible. I appreciate movies but don't watch television. Hiking, camping and backpacking make me happy. Smoking and recreational drugs don't, and I don't want either in my life. I enjoy pets but alas, I am allergic to dogs and birds. Cats are manageable. I'm a big fan of wild birds, though, and love birdwatching.

I enjoy and am inspired by the company of people who appreciate creative expression in whatever form that may take--music, writing, photography, painting, design, etc., even if it's as an enthusiast and you don't do any of these things yourself. I'm a singer and mountain dulcimer player, and a beginner on the banjo.

I'm Jewish by birth and culture but not religion. My Buddhist practice incorporates kindness, mindfulness and bettering the world. Buddhism has no creation story or deity and that appeals to me. What you choose is up to you, including atheism.

I live my life with respect, honesty, and an open heart. I thrive on intimacy. I'm romantic and giving, and it gives me joy to be attentive and appreciative of my partner. I value and consciously engage in being a good communicator and being a good listener, and feel compassion for others. I attend to my physical and emotional health. I have an active inner life and I've been described as an introvert who's learned to be an extrovert.

I'm bisexual and seeking a mutually monogamous relationship with a man, just the two of us. There are a lot of myths about bisexuals, so thanks for ignoring the stereotypes and getting to know me instead.

What I'd Thank My Lucky Stars to Find

Timothy Leary said intelligence is an aphrodisiac. I agree. I don't care about what stuff you own--I want to know what makes your mind light up and your heart sing. I'm seeking a man who is as loving and joyful as I am and expresses that easily, values emotional and physical health, views us as equals, and prioritizes time for our relationship that I hope will last the rest of our lives.

You are single, and live with integrity and humor. Social justice matters to you so you make personal choices to help make the world a better place, in whatever ways move you. You appreciate human diversity and would date someone of any race. When you're outdoors, you appreciate the small wonders of nature along the path and enjoy learning about them. Sleeping in a tent makes you happy.

I'm not looking for a clone of myself. For instance, I don't drink alcohol, but feel free to enjoy it if you're a social drinker as many of my friends are. Our differences are interesting, although if your politics are conservative that wouldn't work.

If you make me laugh, have left-leaning politics, enjoy frequent physical affection, like words and love nature, I might just fall at your feet. I'll even happily share my field guides about birds and flowers so we can geek out on that stuff together. I'm looking for a committed, lifelong partner to come home to. I recognize it will take some time for us to know that about each other. That journey of mutual discovery sounds fabulous to me.

Connecting

If you've read this far, thanks for that. Your thoughtful reply is appreciated, more than a couple of sentences so I can get a sense of who you are and why this ad got your attention. Please include your age and photos with your clothes on. (You can find photos of me online by searching for ""woodswoman writes joshua tree.""). We wouldn't be a fit if you're deeply rooted in the East Bay or South Bay, with too much concrete and traffic for me in both places.

I confess I have no clue how to do traditional dates in cafes. So let's skip that part by getting to know each other on a hike. Not an audition or interrogation. If we enjoy ourselves, we can get together again.

Intrigued? Do tell.

Hi I am an easy going, confident, single AA female living in santa cruz. I am 65 years old in relatively good shape. I'm thick, legs, thighs and ass. I own my own home and I live alone. 
I'm looking for something that may not exist but I'll give it a try.
I am interested in creating a relationship with a married or single man, and I'm open to age and race. 
What I want:
A man with flexible time on his hands (if married or single) -- I do not want to change your life or mine
A man that is professional or blue collar but a good conversationalist
A good dresser (clean, up to date, casual/Jeans or business/shirt and slacks)
A man who is financially stable and knows how to wine and dine a lady
A man with great hygiene and all his teeth
With this man I would like to pretend that we're in REAL LIKE for one weekend out of the month or every two months. I want us to meet at a nice hotel of our choosing to spend the whole weekend. Walking around town holding hands during the day. A nice dinner, maybe some dancing, a little wine at night and then we will go to our room and began having the most incredible sex ever. Of course there has to be passion and a true heartfelt connection in order for the sex to be good. I desire intimacy, honesty, the trust and safety of being with one man. I am looking for someone who enjoys the taste of a women, I'm very good at laying back and spreading my legs wide open giving you plenty of access to my pussy to suck and lick me all you want. I also love having my breast sucked and nibbled but I do not suck cock this may also be a deal breaker just let me know if it is. 
I have a life and I'm sure you do too, I just want a couple of days for myself. 
If this sounds like something that might interest you please feel free to contact me and let's get this party started.
Thank you for reading my post

It's been lonely living alone all these years. It feels even lonelier when I face leaving the expensive Bay Area when I retire in five years, moving far away, all alone, leaving my friends and life here. Therefore, I seek a man, within 8 years of age 60, where after 1-2 years of dating, we move in together, the gentleman needing to live no more than one hour from San Mateo, CA, where I work. However, years ago, I made an oath I'd rather be lonely than in a bad relationship, having been alone now for almost eight years, the longest I've ever been alone. 

I simply seek a happy enough relationship which involves we enjoy each other's social and erotic company and don't argue over money. Socially I enjoy: city culture: live jazz vocals, ballet, museums and movies; outdoor beauty: nature strolls, easy cycling/kayaking and hot springs and emotional stability/maturity to offer genuine friendship. Although I am no longer idealistic as I was in my youth, having embraced life's ironies at age 60, my youthful hippy liberal values still persevere. Erotically, I am the slow sensual type, bordering on tantra, open to minor kink and need total monogamy. I'm usually drawn to guys who keep themselves relatively in shape; I making it the gym 2-3/week and doing some yoga. Financially, I am a middle class professional, have no debt and significantly save. As I rent, I'll certainly have to move when I retire. At this point, I'm considering buying a small home in Eugene, Oregon, a small college town with culture and not far from Portland. I don't eat out much, preferring to spend my expendable income on concerts. I eat simply, mostly soups, salads and stir fries, eating mostly vegetables with meat to flavor. Although I'm healthy, taking no meds, I have some ankle arthritis and am a carrier of HVS 2.

Hi. 
I'm hoping to find a decent, funny, dorky and intelligent guy that just wants to chat with a funny, sweet girl.
Preferably no older than 45 or younger than 25. Someone not into partying or drugs but has a witty out look on life. I like to game currently playing Destiny on the PSN, a Star Wars fangirl for years, I'm a bit geeky :) a foodie with a weakness for sushi and mexican food. Let me stress that this isn't for anything romantic just smart, nerdy, thoughtful conversation. If we click and end up flirting then it's fine but not the reason behind the post.

Attractive SWF, looking for an attractive activity partner and, if there's attraction on both sides, for something meaningful (beyond friendship). 

I'm passionate, sensual, down-to-earth, educated, love to dance, love to travel, love animals, enjoy life performances and movies, the outdoors, weekend trips, sports (skiing, ice-skating, tennis, etc.) or just strolling through S.F.'s neighborhoods. 

I'm looking for someone with similar interests and who is drug, disease and smoke free. Preferably you're in your late 30's to mid-50's and live in the city (or at least close to a BART station). I'm only interested in men who are legally and emotionally available. While I'm not obsessed with astrology, I often connect best with people of the zodiac signs stated in the title of my posting. 

If the above resonates with you, send me an email with your zodiac sign in the subject line, your age and where in the city you live . . . and a picture or two please. 

I look forward to hearing from you! ;o) 

PS: As long as this posting is up, I'm still looking.

Thanks for clicking onto my post. I will get straight to the point.

Well, I am looking for that one special guy for companionship and love and ltr. 
How hard can that be right? :-) 
Can I find you on CL? 
Well, I am giving it a try.
Are you single, no kids, unattached (must be in your forties or later) and ready to build a relationship with that special lady? Asian and Caucasian men are a preferred. Most importantly; are you sincere, have an easy going personality, and considerate of others and treat people like how you want to be treated?
Well, I am single (Asian), unattached and ready to settle down. Just to make it clear...I am not looking for a friend with benefits and or hookups. I have an easy going personality, kind, balanced, loving, considerate of others and treat people like how I would like to be treated.

I am an attractive semi-retired professional who has several qualities and interests. I do not look my age and this I owe to my parents for their genes. I enjoy all sorts of music, sports and many other interests. I am real, enthusiastic with excellent sense of humor. 

One of the many passions I have is cooking. What makes it complete is enjoying a wonderful dinner, candlelight, wine with a great gent and maybe with a fireplace!

I would love to meet a mature, decent, honest, caring, witty, financial stable guy with integrity. Please be a happy person with passions, dreams and be healthy! If you are obsessed with working out at the gym and afraid to eat, I am not your lady! Just be a romantic with patience! I prefer men within the ages of 58 -- 74. 

What would be great is to have ""A Kiss At Midnight"" with my gent once you get to know him (not on first date)! I know this is dreaming but where would we be without dreams! 

I am not into texting to other States or countries so do not waste your time as I am only interested in dating someone in person.

Read them both to see the similarities.

It's usually titled something like ""Playing hookie"" ""Off work today"", ""first/last day of vacation"" or something related to not working today like ""Up early looking to meet a sweet guy to hang out with"" or ""Done with my errands looking for sensual evening"", ""want to hang & bang"".

This is what he's posted over the last 4 days, most 2 - 3 times. Read them and see the similarities.

He collects email address's and sells them in bundles to the spammers & scammers.

CL put the email system in place to try & stop these thieves & parasites - DO NOT give someone your email address (or cell# for that matter) to anyone unless you have gotten to know them first. Any story about the system not working for them or that they can't send pictures is bullshit!

People say they first notice my bright smile, friendly personality, and they say that I'm easy to talk too. I've got a good sense of humor and love to laugh - but always in good taste. I'm a straight-shooter and as genuine and sincere as they come. I'm laid back and down to earth but I get very passionate over various topics. I work with kids, I love what I do, and I'm really good at it. I put my heart and soul into everything that I do. Living a active, healthy lifestyle is paramount to me - I'm not good for anybody, let alone myself, if I don't take good care of my mind, heart, and body. I'm detailed, organized, and admittedly ""slightly"" OCD... but just on some things ;-)

I consider myself to be a modern woman who enjoys the freedom and independence that a good job provides but I'm also old-fashioned in my desire to find a clean-cut man with similar beliefs and character qualities that make him stand out as a strong, humble leader who's confident in who he is, where he came from, and passionate about where he's going in life and he'd like nothing more than for us to join forces together as a team. I'm hoping to find that rare honorable gentleman who is wise, kind, caring, thoughtful, selfless, loyal, generously affectionate and totally over the moon about me - and me for him. I want us both to encourage, build up, and challenge one another to learn and grow and even call each other out (in love) when necessary.

My ideal match would be a healthy, physically fit Caucasian, 6' to 6'2"" with strong broad shoulders and a manly frame that compliments my strong, curvy frame. He'd be between 35-47 have his life in order and not be given over to any vices; single, divorced, or widowed; no children. He'll live local to Marin and his heart is open, ready, and willing to put quality time and effort into finding his best friend, future lover, and life-long companion in me :-)

I could tell you about my hobbies, my work, how much I love to travel....All the usual things. But really, did any of your previous successful relationships depend on shared hobbies? I'm looking for a long term relationship. Not interested in a fling or any kind of hook up. I'd like to take my time and really get to know you.

Now on to the good stuff...
ME: 
I am a single mom who value's family above all else. I am 5'5 with medium length blondish/brown hair and a decent body. I am honest to the core and hope that we can share how sensual that can be. I will never take you for granted and I hope you feel the same..I like to be challenged. I am humble and open minded and like to walk through doors that have never been opened. I banter playfully with an air of coquettishness. I am always looking for a higher mountain to climb. I work hard when I have to but play even harder when given the opportunity. I am a true hedonist when it comes to food and wine. .I would like to meet someone with the same furor and desire..

YOU:
You are intellectual, but not over the top. You are handsome but without the ego. You have good etiquette and value in depth conversations. You don't always have to be right, but welcome the debate. Your financially stable, and welcome a future where you can share the road less traveled. 

YOU AND ME:
Things we could enjoy together? Picnics in the dunes. Champagne with tiny bubbles. Independent films.Cooking something together that we have never made. Hot springs in the mountains. Hiking to our favorite spot and admiring the sunset. Kissing slowly. Talking and listening. Listening and talking. 

If you have read this to the very bottom..I hope you are enticed to respond.

I am a romantic type and also a realist. I present a very secure, independent image and yet underneath is a shy girl afraid of being hurt. I want to continually open myself to new experiences. I love classical music and the arts but miss the sharing of listening to beautiful music with someone special. I like to touch--both heart and soul and share similar likes with another. A brilliant concert or a walk under the stars--it would be nice to have a soul mate. I tend to have an aura about me of intimidation and therefore I am aware of this trait which probably comes from being a single,nice, living and working in a good old boy man's world. What most people do not know about me is that I have a great sense of humor and see irony in many things. I am loyal to my very close friends and while it seems as if I am only interested in culture and the arts I have so many diverse interests and absorb information like a sponge--thank god for high speed cable and the internet--that is one of the reasons I enjoy good conversations and sharing of differing opinions. I have been on Match.com not quite long and clearly many do not read my profile closely and only look at the pictures so I may by nature overstress and dissuade potential matches from contacting me. I am a private person but would like to open the door to new interests--will you be the one who knocks?My close friends would say that my ideal match would be a mirror image of me. I don't think that is exactly true but may be close. My match has to be intelligent and a good conversationalist. My ideal match would want to continue learning and be open to new experiences. I have a passion for music, from classical to classic rock and the arts which has recently been reawakened. I realize that I miss having a soul mate to share these interests with. I am not used to leaving a ""laundry list"" of likes and dislikes however I want someone to share a romantic evening with either at the symphony or just a stroll under the moonlight. The traits I find very attractive in a match would be someone who takes care of himself, from diet to exercise.

I'm writing this on a whim, so I might miss some things. But it's something I've been contemplating for some time now.

I'll try to be brief, honest, and straightforward.

For a while I've juggled friends/partners because each offered part of what I wanted. 
Guy, #1- great in bed, but unavailable otherwise.
Guy, #2- Loves to travel and we go on fun adventures regularly, but we clash fundamentally/he lacks otherwise.
Girl, #3- We've had much fun together both in and out of the bedroom but it's become a friendship since she's committed elsewhere.
Guy, #4- good in bed, but schedules ruin continuity.

Yes, at one point I was involved with these 4 in the same time frame/month or so. And 1/3, 3/4 simultaneously. But, it was more so to try to fulfill my needs rather than pure promiscuity, though I have nothing against that. I'm open minded and respectful of people's preferences. My only reservations are against unsafe sex (I'm a germaphobe)

So, now that I've put it all out there, I'll move on to what I'm searching for.

Ideally, I want a singular person. One person that I can count on to be my friend, lover, adventure partner, and partner in crime- and one that has the time to be such a thing on a regular basis (1-2xs wk at least) 

Granted, that is a lot to ask for... and probably unrealistic seeing as the only way I was able to achieve somewhat fulfillment of these needs was through various different individuals. But, I'll try for it nonetheless. 

Now that you've seen the inner workings of my happily perverted life, please reply with the following: subject line: ""#1"", picture, brief description about you, your likes, desires, current situation, and availability. 

P.s. I am mostly a sub, with some dominant tendencies.

Hi. I'm smart, cute, educated, well-traveled, well-heeled, and mostly well-behaved. I'm funnier on paper than in person, but I'll laugh at your jokes. I suck at laundry but can beat you at full-contact scrabble. I've lived in countries most people haven't heard of (although I hope you have). I like old movies, good books, and jazz. I'm certified organic and frequently kind to strangers. Small animals adore me.

Since this is just going to be over the phone, I don't care what you look like. I'm more interested in your mind than the size of your muscles (or anything else; please don't send me pictures of your anything-elses). 

Older is better (assuming wisdom and experience are commensurate with age) - let's say 38 to 55ish. My only requirement (listen carefully) is that you are VERY smart, funny/witty, educated or knowledgeable, interesting, and open-minded (i.e. if you don't believe in evolution, apply to your local university, not to me). It wouldn't hurt if you have a nice voice. I love a man's deep voice. 

Tell me 5 things about yourself that show off how smart, funny, and interesting you are. Generic emails that aren't written specifically for me or don't include those 5 things will be deleted. Be creative, boys. ;)

The song warns you not to go ""looking for love in all the wrong places,"" but the only wrong places are those without you. Maybe you are reading CL because you are horny. I was/am/have. But maybe you're also reading because you're lonely. Maybe you want someone around who gives a fuck how your day was, who is the first person you celebrate good news with, the last face you see at night, and the arms that you run for refuge in when the world is too hard. I do.

Maybe you're reading CL because you like to fuck. Maybe you like to fuck girls like me: a smartass smartypants. I believe a glue gun can do almost anything, Anonymous is a sex symbol, and kissing is the same as prayer. I'm sure-fire foxy. I'm built like the new Barbie doll -- you know, the one with hips. I have brown hair and hazel eyes, tattoos and piercings, and at least 3 garter belts. I am slightly wicked. I am Minutemen Fugazi X. I am Bukowski, Nin, Burroughs. I am Hirst, Sherman, Witkin. And I might be yours. I'm 5'11"" and 47. I'm financially independent, stable, and I don't get my crazy on other people. I'm easy, and I'm super picky.

You can turn the wrong place into the right one if you're by my side. You are between 35 and 50, over 5'10"", are ruthlessly loyal and spit passionflowers. Smart, subversive, sexy and stable.

Hi. I've posted this a few times before and talked to or met some great guys, but none of the dates seemed to turn into anything long term so I'm posting again.

I am a BBW that is looking for a long term relationship. I am not looking for just a hook up or one-night stand. I am looking for something that will turn into long term. 

I have a car, a house, a stable job, and now I'm looking for someone to spend time with. If you think you might be interested please email me back. I think I would have most in common with a man around 40ish-50ish years old. I am 46 and I have long light brown hair, blue eyes, and average height. I am a Big Beautiful Woman (BBW) which means I am overweight. I am looking for a man that can see beyond that to accept me for the great person that I am. I have a positive outlook and a lot of interests. I am a smart and pretty easy going person and I'm open to what I'm looking for....as long as we enjoy each others company and can carry on a conversation.

I like all the ""normal"" stuff: Movies, concerts, comedy shows, restaurants, bars, bowling, watching TV, cooking, etc. I like music and to dance but I'm not very good. I drink at social occasions but not to excess, I like mixed drinks better than beer. I don't smoke and would prefer someone who only smokes rarely, if at all. I would love to find someone thats interested in going out and having fun. My ultimate goal is to get married and live happily ever after in monogamous relationship, so I'm hoping to find someone that is on the same path. 

I'm from SJ and I'd love to get out and explore the whole bay area more! I'm able to drive to other cities around the general bay area if you have fun ideas of what to do there. 

Let me know about yourself (the basics: where do you work/live) and something to start a conversation like something interesting about yourself or where you like to go on dates.

Hello, I'm a divorced, college educated, professional female (software engineer). I'm attracted to Asian American men ( Korean, Japanese, Chinese). 

Interested in professional, easy-going man with a sense of humor. Seeking someone clean cut, well-rounded, and educated. Family, friends, and a balanced & healthy lifestyle are important. While I'm looking for the right LTR I'm not looking to rush things. Let's have fun getting to know each other and take it from there. Here list of a few more things I'm looking for.


-Non Smoker
-College degree
-Be financially responsible
-Single/Divorced (separated is not single or divorced)
-D/D free
-A nice/good guy
-HWP
-No facial hair
-Be available emotionally and have time to put into a relationship. I know we're all busy here in the Bay area but make sure you have the time to put into a relationship to give it the best shot of working. 
-Live within 20 miles of Fremont.
-I tend to do better with younger men... I'm 53 but have been told I look to be in my early 40s. Ideally 40-55 would be my range but I wouldn't disqualify based on age. 
-Most importantly I'm not looking for a guy to just settle down and grow old with.... I want a true dynamic and passionate connection. I'm looking for all the trapping of a relationship. 


If this sound like you, drop a line and tell me about yourself, No one liners, please use complete sentences and send a G-rated picture. In your reply post your location so I'll know you're real and they don't end up in my Spam folder. 

I'd like to exchange a few emails and then talk OTP before meeting to make sure we're a match. I don't want to exchange tons of emails before meeting as I find a face to face is the best way to chat.

Thanks,
Deborah

I don't need you to have money.

Prefer it if you don't have religion.

I am fit, healthy, kind, creative, eclectic, 
multifaceted, interested in too many kinds of things to list --

Most of the Sciences, the visual arts, movies, plays, current events, how the world works, how people work.... 

An example of a subset:

I love folk music, Classical music, Renaissance music, Baroque music, ""world music"" and some popular types.

I'm interested in all facets of a relationship, not JUST the physical, so I need to find someone I can communicate with.

"" ... I'd like to do with you what spring does to the cherry trees ..."" ~ Pablo Neruda



I'm here in the haystack of Craigslist to find that proverbial needle. Could it be you? Who knows? Anything is possible! 

I'm engaging, articulate, smart and funny. Sassy at times, too. I'm creative, enthusiastic and I know how to listen and pay attention. I'm looking for a man with similar persuasions who understands the importance of self-inquiry and is committed to a soulful life. Kindness and kissing are also paramount!

International travel is a great passion of mine and I'd love to share these experiences with my beloved at my side. Local adventuring is also great and I love to explore, hike and be out in nature doing just about anything. Playing in the city is fun, too. 

Fitness and health are important to me, but I am fanatical about neither of them. These days, I prefer oxytocin highs to adrenaline rushes. 

I enjoy writing, reading, dancing, concerts, theatre, films and cultural events of all kinds, along with sharing simple, tender quiet times at home together. Music, poetry and creative expression are deep sustenance in my life. I have no interest in spectator sports, nascar, any organized religion or television. 

I enjoy spirited discussions but I'm not interested in righteous debate. I lean far to the left politically and have little interest in conspiracy theorists. My spiritual life is important to me, but I steer clear of dogma. 

Sexuality is central in a relationship, but I am completely uninterested in casual sex. Let me say that again in case it gets missed: I am not the least bit interested in casual sex. Intimacy takes time to develop and I want to take that time.

I'm far from perfect and so are you; but we are perfectly ourselves and that is enough.

The world of online dating is confounding. I've had a few fun forays and a few more frustrating fumbles. I've been confused by experiences with men who seem interested, but then suddenly disappear without a word or a trace; and I've heard the same from some of them about women. I wonder about how those exchanges affect us as we pursue relationship. It seems like we don't quite know how to gracefully navigate these waters; and yet many of us are looking for similar things: a like-minded and spirited person with whom we can grow and laugh and share and walk through life. 

That's what I'm looking for . . . how about you? 

I recognize that the one-dimensionality of words and photos on computer screens is limited at best. I see this venue as simply one tool, a first step to possibly meet someone who shares common interests and values. Endless emails and titillating talk are not my thing. Let's get real, leave the virtual world behind and find out whether something worth sharing is possible between us.

If you're moved to write back, please share a little something of substance about you. 

All the best to you in finding what your heart desires!

Here's what I'm imagining: I meet a charming guy who enjoys my gentle intensity and alluring vulnerability. I open up to him as he coaxes out my true, confident self and attempts to capture it with photography. He helps me learn how to pose shamelessly and gracefully. He sees through my physical beauty into my inspired psyche and the pictures he takes are often stunningingly reflective of that. There's a hot tension between us but neither dares make the move for weeks and weeks, unwilling to risk the powerful artistic relationship that's forming. I appreciate his restraint, as it shows how much he respects me as an artist, a friend, and a woman. Eventually, when we do start having sex, it will be deeply blissful because of the strong emotional connection already there. I've never had a relationship like this but I think it would be amazing. I'm legit and likely headed for success, but I'd love some help getting there ;) 34"" 24"" 34"" C cup.

About ME: 
- chronologically newly septuagenarian, but I look and feel 50-ish
- height 5'4"", weight 130s (HWP), pretty face 
- raised east-coast Jewish; now spiritually liberal / inclusive / progressive 
- enjoy wine, spirits, and the herb (all in moderation); intolerant of tobacco 
- own my home on the mid-peninsula 

About YOU: 
- age appropriate (~60-75) 
- somewhat taller and bigger than me, but still height-weight proportionate (HWP)
- geographically proximate (the closer the better....)

About US both: 
- legally and emotionally available (i.e., single/divorced/widowed and not currently partnered)
- seeking a best friend, lover, and partner...for the long term 
- educated / intelligent / articulate
- reasonably fit and in good health (no tobacco) 
- financially solvent / responsible
- active / lively / interested
- liberal / progressive -- socially, politically, spiritually 
- values-based, ethical lifestyle 
- kind, gentle, warm, affectionate, considerate, dependable

Although I appreciate and applaud ethnic and lifestyle diversity, I am looking to partner with someone who -- like me -- is Caucasian, heterosexual, and monogamous.

If you resonate with this post, please write to tell me about yourself, including age, location, and current photo(s). I will happily respond in kind if we seem to be a match.

You be attentive and thoughtful. If you succeed in making me feel special then I'll make sure I take care of you. 
I'm not looking to change your life. Just enhance it a bit. 

Im not the needy type, but if you want that we can work something out. 
You must be in good shape, able to host. 
I am std/dd free and you must be too. 

Tell me what you're looking for and age.

I currently live in South/East San Jose (only rent a room so if you have a place of your own that would be nice), working as a Contractor as a Word Processor, enjoy live concerts and events, picnics, walks with my little 8lbs fur baby, movies (comedies and romance), cooking/eating Hawaiian, Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, Mexican, Italian, American, etc., etc. LOL food, and doing a lot of other things.

Hi everyone!

Well, my headline pretty much sums it up. I am just a regular lady looking for a nice guy. As for me, I am well established in my career and have my masters in place. My ethnicity is based on a mixture of European and Central American countries and my nationality is American. I was born in San Francisco and went to school there. I am a fan of our local teams Giants, Raiders, A's and Sharks. :) 

I don't have any kids, don't smoke, don't drink and don't do drugs but I do have 2 cats, a love of spending time with my friends and family and have a strong sense of faith in God.

That being said while I have a strong faith system, I also believe in live and let live. If people want to act/be/do certain things leave em' be! My faith is a strong cornerstone of my moral compass -- but I do not share it with my partner unless they specifically ask. 

I would love to have kids, but I know it's way late in the game for me. My hope is that my future partner would be open to adoption and if he has kids, letting me share in their life's journey as well (with the understanding I would love them though as they were my own!)

As for who I am looking for -- just a nice guy who is looking for the same things as me. I do ask that you be drug-, disease- and smoke- free. It's just what I prefer in my partner. Drinking is all good as long as you are responsible with it (my ex almost killed a family while driving under the DUI-- not good!) Someone in their late 30-mid 40's is the range, weight/height doesn't matter (I am 5'6). 

So, let's email and see what happens?

(Although I do have a weakness for facial hair and tall men--ssshhh....) I always have gotten along well with men, and feel they can be misunderstood.

I enjoy being with friends, finding great places for getting together, cultural events, big cities, tons of other things. I have a devilish, prankster, and smart ass side. I was very annoying on occasion to my ex, but I did with such charm he never requested I stop! My mother in law said he was lucky I raised our kids.

I seek one man for long term connection of the heart and body. Real men over 30 only, with stability, mobility, and classy sensibilities. The shallow, unemployed, long distance, dependent men will not be happy with me.

I'm not into swinging or group sex. Just looking for a SANE man who is fun, emotionally stable, has his act together and most importantly reliable.

I don't want to be in a relationship with someone who is selfish or arrogant.

My ideal soulmate is Caucasian, caring, fit, and he is supportive. He wants to start a family. He cares about people. He is a kind person. He is attentive and a great listener.

Serious about what I am looking for, including the preferences.

Looking for a long term relationship with a polyamorous single or attached man. You must be ok with me being married, and most importantly have the time and desire to be my loving boyfriend with a very supportive partner if you have one. :) My husband is fully aware and supportive of my search as I am fully aware and supportive of his relationship with his wonderful girlfriend. I am currently not dating, but I would like to find someone to have a relationship with. Perhaps start as friends, unless the chemistry is so strong we go straight into the relationship! I would like to start meeting once a week, and if things progress well, maybe more often. I have the time, energy and desire to put into a loving, respectful healthy relationship outside my marriage. Now on to what I seek in my partner.

Where are you my nerdy, lovable lovey love love?

Are you nerdy, geeky, sweet, gentle, in your mid 30's to early 40's? There is so much to this kind of guy. Believe me, you are admired more than you know. I encourage you to please step up! So many of you on here, never posting, and a lot of times in fear of responding, how unfortunate. :( You guys are definitely the hottest guys around. Simply adorable! I just want to wrap my arms around you, hug you so tightly! Haha. Love and care for you with time (maybe sooner!) once our friendship has evolved into more...and all I ask in return, is for the same. :)

You: Poly, geeky, quiet (but not so when you are comfortable with the one you love!), cute in your own unique loving way, slender/slim athlete/average, light eyes, white male
Me: (Only going by what I have been told, btw) Cute, sexy, fun, warm, caring, loving, always smiling. I can be a bit shy but that special someone can easily break me out of that! latina, early 40's

Please describe yourself thoroughly, including age in order to get a response.

...seeking the right partner/companion/lover to connect with me in the dance of life.

Like me, you are still active, attractive, bright, lively, fun, and engaged. We've partnered before but we're both single now; we still long to experience and express the love that's in our hearts.

I seek a man who is age-appropriate (60-75) and lives within a reasonable driving distance. Here are some specifics about me: HWP (5'4""/~137 lbs.), healthy, vibrant, youthful; educated, intelligent, articulate; politically and spiritually progressive; enjoyer of music, movement, wine, spirits, and herb (all in moderation), but cannot tolerate tobacco; lifelong learner, turned on by people, ideas, activities. Your description of yourself should be similar to mine.

Still there? Then please write to describe yourself and why you're responding. Your response should include your age, location, and photo (reciprocated, of course, if we seem to be a match)...but if that's all you provide it will most likely not be sufficient.

I look forward to learning about who you are and what you're looking for, and -- if we're lucky -- a genuine connection.

I hope your having a good day.

I would never in my life try to find someone on here but why not give it a try. I am looking for someone long term and possibly share my life with. I am a young professional woman already in my career and have grown so much in my life as a person with the life roadblocks we get thrown at on the daily. I am very wise and always told I am an old soul but my cockiness and ambition never let me settle until I knew I was ok career wise. I do believe in old traditions and have full faith in my higher power lord Jesus Christ. FYI -- If your not going to church on your own or Christian its best to skip my ad. I don't want your time wasted nor do I want my time wasted. 

I am really social; family oriented, and love my job. I am adventurous, love to travel, love to eat, love nature, and movies. I enjoy painting, listening to music, and anything new and fun and interesting to do. I love to be spoiled and surprised and love spoiling and surprising mines as well. I love to be the center of attention and enjoy affection in public. 
If you want to see me, let me see you first. My heart will never change but my looks will although I have never been told I am ugly so don't worry.

Cinderella is a real fair tale. She was beautiful, smart and hard-working girl. She did not wait for love and Prince to come to her home. She put much efforts to find and meet him. She escaped her step sisters and step-mother and went to Castle to meet her Prince of Charming. Cinderella was elegant, classy and goal -oriented girl and she loved shoes. Today crystal shoes are replaced by Christian Loboutin and Manolo Blahnic and Prince ... just by Prince of Charming every single woman is looking for in New York.

Success in dating life is to find the right man that fits one's personality, desires, wishes, goals and dreams. I believe that life is all energy and high quality single with positive energy attract the same one.

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, in which city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

Good afternoon,

I'm a 41-year-old (but told I look late 20s) blonde, blue neuroscientist who loves to do yoga, walk on wet sand or in the woods barefoot, and advance my experience in various forms of healing (reiki, different styles of massage, pranic healing, sound healing). I am not seeking a one-night encounter or ""friend with benefits"", but rather to settle down into a LTR with a partner whom I can enjoy nature, touch-based energy healing, partner yoga (at least willing to learn), and new adventures like learning new cultures, new forms of healing, and most importantly openness, honesty, trust, respect, and love that is not based in lust but does lead to romance when kindled with care and time. I am not ""poly"" and am not seeking to be with someone who is. Please put ""Nature"" in the subject line so I know you're not spam.

I am a 24 year old woman with the most beautiful grey green eyes but behind them lays a story of pain, suffering and adversities. I want to overcome all that I've been through and am not giving up but it sure would help to have someone along this journey. I have been homeless and injured (broken ankle on crutches and have a cast on my leg) for a month now and it's been challenging but I thank GOD for healing me even though I'm going through alot I know it's all to benefit me and I will come out stronger. But I do need surgery soon and housing so I have a place to rest and build my strength and heal from the procedure aswell as affection and someone to be my partner in this. I will repay you as much as I can with help with some of the bills and provide friendship and when I'm better and able to stand on my own I will cook, clean, garden and take care of you. If interested in discussing this possibility send me a picture, number and description. Don't email me if you are not a believer in GOD or humble.

I am seeking a man who wants to co-create a joyful and conscious relationship that celebrates life and facilitates growth, both as individuals and partners. 

About ME: 
- chronologically newly septuagenarian, but I look and feel 50-ish
- height 5'4"", weight 130s (HWP), pretty face 
- raised east-coast Jewish; now spiritually liberal / inclusive / progressive 
- enjoy wine, spirits, and the herb (all in moderation); intolerant of tobacco 
- own my home on the mid-peninsula 

About YOU: 
- age appropriate (~60-75) 
- somewhat taller and bigger than me, but still height-weight proportionate (HWP)
- geographically proximate (the closer the better....)

About US both: 
- legally and emotionally available (i.e., single/divorced/widowed and not currently partnered)
- seeking a best friend, lover, and partner...for the long term 
- educated / intelligent / articulate
- reasonably fit and in good health (no tobacco) 
- financially solvent / responsible
- active / lively / interested
- liberal / progressive -- socially, politically, spiritually 
- values-based, ethical lifestyle 
- kind, gentle, warm, affectionate, considerate, dependable

Although I appreciate and applaud ethnic and lifestyle diversity, I am looking to partner with someone who -- like me -- is Caucasian, heterosexual, and monogamous.

If you resonate with this post, please write to tell me about yourself, including age, location, and current photo(s). I will happily respond in kind if we seem to be a match.

You think the only people who are people are the people who look and think like you.
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger, you'll learn things you never knew you never knew.

We are not our bodies - - bodies are merely vessels that carry the essence of who we are.
We are not our cars, not our jobs, not our property but we tend to identify ourselves
by our stuff.

If you can relate to this type of thinking, we might have some good conversations.

I exist in a somewhat chubby body that has been around for 7 decades. I am seeking a
boyfriend to share good times. My best qualities are my sense of humor, intelligence, sensuality,

I keep meeting seemingly interesting and like minded people from here but they all have one very annoying thing in common, their jobs rule their lives. I'm a workaholic as much as the next person and considering the area we live in, I don't expect anything less. The thing that sets me apart is that I still choose to make time for a social life and make time for my friends and the person I might be interested in. Before you chose to respond to my ad, please ask yourself if you have atleast 1-2 days a week to hang out and have fun. I'm sick of giving people attention that have intention of returning the same. I'm not clingy and very much so independent but if i put in the effort, I'm expecting the same. 

I'm a noise junkie and spend a lot of time at shows. I love everything from house to dnb. Serious bonus points if you dig electronic music. I could talk for days about music. Also like my fair share of punk, trip hop, hip hop and weird indescribable ambiant music :p 

I like riding bikes and taking random drives late at night. I live for summers when i'm festival hopping with my friends. Plants make me happy. My hair is purple :) I really just wanna meet someone with good intentions and lots on their mind. 

Please only respond if you think we will actually have stuff in common. I usually only end up meeting 1-2 people from about 100 responses. Due to the nature of my work, meeting people in day to day life is a little hard. 

Looking forward to your responses :)

I would love to find a long term relationship but I've had no luck so far. I'm a SWF BBW. I'm fun, adventurous, and loving. If you're not interested in a LTR but are an amazing and patient teacher I'd also love to hear from you. I enjoy sex but would like to find someone who can help me to become better at sex. I am looking for someone who is handsome, clean, no drugs or diseases, and that will be honest with me.

I am a careful observer and listener. I have the gift of feeling the pain people carry around inside them even when they cannot feel it themselves and so I am moved by everyone I encounter.

I am looking for a man who shares who is he and what he has easily with others. Someone who loves his whole body and thinks with every part of it. A man who hears a baby's cry as a call for attention and comfort, not as an annoyance. A man who is serous about loving and being loved and goes bravely forward seeking both. A man who dares to tell the whole truth and to hear the whole story.

Looking for a great guy who wants a romantic partner. Someone who would enjoy and has the time to meet for candlelight dinners once a week and weekend adventures to destinations like wine country, Carmel, Santa Barbara. I've been on my own for six months and spending Saturday evenings with girlfriends has started to pull on my heartstrings. I am attractive, with an engaging personality, playful, sincere and well educated.

I am very sensual and passionate and not being able to express these feelings with someone I care for brings me to this post. I am truly looking for a guy who creates high energy with me and sparks fly when we touch. Someone who makes me smile when he enters a room and kisses me softly so that I know he cares.

I am searching for a special guy who is 40-55, witty and great conversationalist, established in his career, 5'9 or taller, athletic build, dark hair I can run my fingers through, can wear a suit to match my little black dress and heels and a casual outfit when we wake up for Sunday brunch.

I am 45, caucasian, 5'6 120lbs, dark blonde hair, with bright green eyes. I live and work in San Francisco. I adore children but do not have my own. I spend my free time running, playing tennis, hiking and being spontaneous. If you have connected with this post, please tell me about yourself and share a photo.

I feel lost; not sure if what I want is even realistic. If I don't keep hoping & looking, does that mean I'm settling? I have tried dating a little bit, but either ppl aren't looking for commitment or there's no lust. Sometimes I stay home on a Sat and question why I'm not on a date. I am reluctant to date bc you keep trying and just don't want to be disappointed anymore. I go on these online dating sites, but how do I decide who I should invest. I think I lost the desire & the ability to go out there and date again. I even went as far as moving and thinking that the stars will align and he will show up. Another Epic fail. It feels lonelier more than ever now. 

Meeting ppl at bars, what are the chances that I will meet a good one. meet up events do they even work? I don't believe in work place relationships. Ppl I know are already married and with kids. Has this boat sailed? I rejected 3 ppl in the past, were those decisions mistakes? Live and learn, but decisions have consequences, and on facebk everyone is married with kids. 

I don't want a one night stand. I'm too old for that now. Sex is bland with out passion and connection. 

I want to feel nervous and have butterfly feeling when on a date with someone I really like and he really likes me back. Someone who is not reluctant to commitment if there's a special connection. He must want a family. 

I'm not super pretty, but I'm not ugly either. Yeah I'm short, but I'm a female so that's ok. I'm educated and make a good living. I don't think I sux in bed. So why am I the only one that's not spoken for? 

Looking for a special, lasting connection. Someone worth the time & effort. We're not getting any younger, let's get it together now. I'm educated, financially stable, and have a good profession. Additionally, I'm also family-oriented. I look for the same in a man. 

Me: Viet, 5'0, healthcare.

I'm open to ppl who wanna provide me positive or insightful feedback and perspective. You don't have to rude about it. 

However, if you're interested in dating: the following are my preference...
33-38, educated, employed, not interested in Indians

He is very well-educated, athletic and fit, love of nature and literature, good cooking, play tennis and or golf, fond of classical music and a concert goer in SF.

To me, smart is sexy. He is intellectual, smart, fit and athletic, enjoys one outdoor sport, classy, and into cultural activities such concerts and stimulating conversation.

Realistically, I would like to meet men whose age ranges 46-53 y/o and are currently single.

I'm politically progressive, well-rounded person with diverse interests in performing art and science. I like someone that is a good listener and social, and with a professional career with a happy outlook on life. Are you with a lighter baggage that you have more time for the romantic relationship?

Hello and thank you for reading my CL post.

I'm an attractive, petite, fun, fit , funny (you'll just have to trust me on this) Jewish, East Coast, auburn-haired, blue-eyed, sultry-voiced woman looking for someone with whom to enjoy many of the following (in no particular order):
Hiking, biking and skiing (extra points if you ski or 'board)
Theater
Foreign and independent films
Travel
Road trips in search of the best diner
Getting lost for hours in a book store
Live music (blues are my favorite)
Comedy shows
Great food, interesting cocktails
Scintillating conversation
Unabashed silliness
---And lots of fun!

I'm a social drinker, 420-friendly, easy going, low drama and truly don't sweat the small stuff. Life experiences have taught me that unless someone is dead or dying, all other things can be worked out.

I'm a bit of a news junkie and a dyed-in-the-wool liberal. (I'm campaigning for Bernie Sanders.) 
I get my news from the NY Times, Amy Goodman and Bill Maher. I believe that Bill Moyers deserves rock star status. 

I love to cook and I love to read. Ergo -- I read a lot of cookbooks. This is quite different from watching a lot of cooking shows. (Anecdotal evidence informs me that people who watch cooking shows don't cook -- they're too busy watching cooking shows.)

After a long sales career, I recently transitioned to a fundraising role for a wonderful East Bay nonprofit. It feels great to work with like-minded people toward a common humanitarian goal.

So, what am I looking for? A man who is physically fit, emotionally evolved, knows himself well, has learned from past relationships, has a good sense of humor, likes to laugh, and doesn't take himself too seriously. As important, he knows how to have a mature, honest, loving and monogamous relationship and is a gentleman -- in word and deed. 

Also, at least three people have to think you're funny (and one of them can't be your mother).

I'm a happy person looking for someone to share the happiness and the journey. If we have things in common, you're looking for a unique woman and a great relationship, and what I've written resonates with you, I look forward to hearing from you.

Serious replies only, i.e., you're really looking for a relationship and not because your well-meaning mother and married friends think you should be in a relationship, or you think you want to be in a relationship but you're just not sure, etc., etc., Please, save us both the time and trouble and don't reply if you're ambivalent.

Your pic gets mine.

Hi there. I'm seeking a good friend/lover. I have a hair brushing fetish and prefer someone who enjoys or doesn't mind brushing my hair-it's nothing sexual. I'm in my mid 30s, cute, funny, smart, etc... Enjoy doing most things within reasons... If you're seriously interested and don't care that I'm on the heavier side, then I encourage you to respond. Your Pics first would be appreciated.

Summer is approaching and there is fun to be had! BBQs, swimming in rivers and lakes, walking barefoot on grass, having drinks and watching the sunset after river rafting. 

There's nothing better than spending time together with a man that's smart, creative, and a bit sexy. And one who enjoys going to farmer's market for fresh produce!

I'm 5'3, - and in shape, as I enjoy working out. I'm stable, sane, employed, and have my own home. I enjoy cultural outings, outdoor activities, and the genuine companionship of someone in a similar life situation whose interests match my own. I'm well read, politically astute, and enjoy a great conversation.

Now for the harder stuff: I'm looking to expand my social life and possibly meet someone special. A friend first that evolves and grows into something more. I think the best couples are friends as well as lovers.

I'm looking for a SWM professional (white collar) guy who is grounded, reliable, and introspective. Someone who is comfortable enough in his own skin to see the humor in life's ups and downs and can laugh at himself. Someone close to my age who lives nearby. I live in Concord (boring, I know!!)

I like to spend time hanging out in the City catching some lunch or checking out an art gallery and then a hike and out for drinks. Maybe swimming out here in the east bay, being lazy in the sun for a bit, and then going to a movie. Or maybe you teach me something totally out of my comfort zone.

I like fast cars and guys who enjoy speed. Not much beats taking a drive with the top down and the music up loud. I like going out dancing and there is something so sensual as being in the arms of a man on the dance floor.

I like people who enjoy taking a risk and going to new places and trying new items on the menu. You never know until you give it a try!

I also enjoy that connection to spirituality, whatever that means for each of us. I believe there is a greater power out there and that gives me a lot of satisfaction and peace. I'm a beginner when it comes to meditation but spending some quiet time going inward helps me deal with life's challenges.

I'm attracted to a confident man - one who is driven by the need to succeed - but who also has another side to him. A funny, silly side. And understands the work/life balance. And, who when teased, can laugh at himself a bit. 

If my posting interests you, please respond back with your information- age, hobbies and background, and a picture.

Hi, I am looking to meet a kind gentleman on here around the same age as me. 
I can be a little shy so it's hard for me to meet new people. 

I am a sweetheart and love to laugh. Some of my interests include cooking, watching documentaries, hiking, playing video games, and listening to rnb. 

I would like to meet a man that is mature and responsible, chivalrous, kind-hearted, values loyalty, and also 420 friendly.

To be completely honest, I am looking for a relationship with one person. I am not interested in fwb or casual sex or dating multiple people at once. I want to get to know someone, develop trust, and if we are compatible I would want to move forward to build a solid and stable partnership.

I do not self-identify as an academic, but am a university student who is thinking of writing a dissertation shortly down the road, but I am not sure. As of now, I have some lengthy thesis writing experience and in general have contributed some substantial research and written work in U.S. History, (but I have since been branching out of history, although I may pursue some graduate work this quarter in Subaltern Studies.) My strengths are close reading, archival historical research, finding and explicating sources, and my writing is very detailed and hyper-analytical. At worst, my writing is plagued by excess detail, wordy prose, not so constructive revising/editing practices, nauseating repetition, disorganization, losing sight of the argument I started with, as well as an over-explication of sources and overstated reminders. I am also in the habit of procrastinating or simply dwelling too long on one area and consequently turning in work late, sometimes with typographical errors and really, I am such a hyper-critical perfectionist that I will cringe and brood over any errors I find in a submitted draft. It would be nice to find someone who has either written a dissertation, and/or someone whose strong suit is academic mentoring and editing, someone who has a good (better) work ethic for academic projects, and/or someone who is some kind of aspiring or professional writer. I also enjoy creative writing pursuits very much and thought it would be interesting to meet an aspiring or established novelist, screenwriter, or comedy writer. I am keen on anything from the comic in Aristophanes to Chris Rock. 

I think it is a good rule and ethical to be upfront so I thought I would state I am dealing with chronic depression and tend to have a cynical attitude about life. I am also currently nursing a somewhat wounded heart and have some tremendous self-esteem issues. (Other than that, as if that preface did not seem undesirable enough, I am hyper-sensitive and in some respects maladaptive in interpersonal communications and feel overwhelmed and slighted easily in social situations and dwell excessively over perceived slights.) Needless to overstate, I am in a delicate place. Due to this, I am not an ideal candidate for dating at the moment and would like to endeavor to strictly enforce that boundary for the sake of my mental health and well-being and yours. What I do hope to find and cultivate however is an intensely intellectual comaraderie with a like-minded person, and to feel inspired. Perhaps we could collaborate on writing and research if our disciplines or interests overlap. Collaboration is key -- I already have previous experience working underneath someone and being micro-managed and talked down to by a thesis adviser, so I would like to avoid that kind of treatment.

Cultivating a safe shared spare to vent about our respective psychological and life distress would be ideal also, but I might waive that criteria if I think I am being too self-absorbed or over-sharing; I am already (not prematurely) concluding that the ideal person to confide in is a counselor/clinician, but I feel reluctant as their condescension and authority can feel abrasive. Then again, anyone, myself included (even when I endeavor to be empathetic in the most down to earth way and even when I try my best to not lose sight of the condescension I have been treated to), can come off condescending and abrasive. That said, I am not saying I think it would hurt to try to foster a therapeutic friendship outside of academic collaboration based on venting our respective mental distresses; I am saying I would certainly closely monitor it and make sure it doesn't get too intense and unhealthy.

I thought I would end this ad by listing some academic and other interests: journalism (though I have had some irritating experiences writing for a journalist), social welfare studies, sociology (an intersectional perspective that accounts for race, class, sexuality and other social stigma), doing archival/historical research, rhetoric/argumentation, social activist efforts, ethnic and gender studies, African diaspora studies, history (early to present U.S., medieval to modern Europe, South Asia and the Middle East, the ancient Near East, etc.,) political science (early to present party ideology and party politics, voter habits, race and gender in party politics), critiquing ideologues and pop culture, film studies, comparative literature (deconstruction, literary theory, semiotics, the activity of interpretation/comparing interpretation methods, the rhetoric of humor/humor theories, assessing which and why what literary interpretations are more optimal than others, comparing Enlightenment era thinkers, etc.), philosophy (Kant, Wittgenstein, Frege, Burge, Rorty, Critchley, among others, though I do not have a command over any of them and admittedly get frustrated reading them); movie nights, long introspective discussions, exchanging dark secrets, late night eats at a diner, nostalgia, wallowing while listening to melancholy music (Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, The Smiths, Elliott Smith, Radiohead, Chopin, Eric Satie), Oscar Wilde's command for epigram and insights, Allen Ginsberg's endearing bitterness, the detailed introspective writing of Virginia Woolf and Marcel Proust, getting pumped up like a dork listening to the ""Gonna Fly Now"" theme from the ""Rocky"" series, getting lost in overly idealistic, elaborative romantic fantasies that I quickly debase with cold cynicism and borderline misanthropy; horror movies done well, non-condescending high-fives, cleaning, good tacos, film projectors, someone with a detailed command and taste for literary and film criticism (an area I do not have a prowess for, though I really do not have a prowess for anything it seems except wallowing in morbid depression), people who consistently inspire me to carry on so that I can become strong enough to consistently inspire the same in others, people who like going on long drives as the driver, people who revel in non sequiturs and who have a strong stomach for morbid divulgences, someone who wants to walk with you through the hell you're in and who won't complain about the encumbering heat, etc.

Please tell me your age, your academic/professional field, your creative pursuits, your hobbies/interests, what area you live in, what you hope to get out of this connection, etc.

Hi there! I'm a 51 year old lady that lives on the peninsula in Redwood City. I have heard many people consider that being in your fifties is is synonymous with getting old. This is not the case for me. Being in my fifties has been fabulous for me.I am still very young at heart! I still go to live concerts and love to be in the front row when my favorite band is playing. I am active and healthy. However, this wasn't always the case as I only quit smoking 5 years ago. I promise, I am not a fitness snob. I just have learned how great I feel in comparison to before. A few years ago I joined a running training group. I now run in 5K races and working towards doing a 10K. I go to a personal trainer twice a week and I also go to a gym. I have a wonderful family. We are close and enjoy each other's company very much even though we are not all in close proximity. I also have a great group of friends who I adore spending time with. I love to travel and would be so happy to find someone who also likes to have adventures both near and far away! Although I am a really independent person I'm looking for someone special who would enjoy spending time on weekends together, going to movies shows, out to dinner and generally enjoy each other's company. 

Please have a car and be financially secure...I do and I am. 

Please include a pic in your response...I will send a pic back.

Don't....Do NOT send me a message if you are married, pretending to be separated, or in any way involved with someone or looking to be financially taken care of.

About me: 

Very pretty SWF, size 4, a looker! 
Professional / advanced degrees 
Avid runner 
Yoga practitioner 
Love all things pink and purple 

My smile and eyes are my most prominent and attractive features 
I love the woods 
I love staying up late and seeing the dawn, lazy Sundays in bed with you 

I love to have fun and cut up with someone special - once a special relationship has been established 
Trying to teach myself Italian (slow process) 

A smart, quick thinking man is the ultimate turn-on for me 
I am delightful, delicious, demure, even dainty, subtle, sweet, sexy. 

The type of man I seek: 
I am seeking a successful, confident, and intelligent SWM, 56-72, who knows how to enjoy life. 
A man who will break his routine and try something new, or maybe try something new that he did not enjoy 7 years ago, 
like to learn a new language, a new dance, a new sport (i.e. - cross-country skiing). 

I am seeking a man who is looking for one woman to be his partner - a man who wants a longterm companion to engage in discovery with. 
Prefer a SWM who is well-educated (grad. degrees), sensitive and moved by nature, animals and the arts, a gentleman, kind to everyone 
(including waiters :-), 
successful in his chosen profession and he should still be excited about his professional work. 

Note - a man who dreads his work would not be a good match for me. 

Important - you must be truly single - not separated or married. Age IS important - I look very young - but I am Not attracted to young men.

Hi,
I went home early from work today, and I'm thinking I might go get some food tonight. I would love to meet someone and talk over dinner. Are you open tonight? I am partial to Sushi, but am open if you have a different idea.

Let me know your age, location, ethnicity to get started, and we'll go from there. I'm 43, strawberry blonde, blue eyes, in Santa Clara and caucasian. 
I work near Lawrence Expressway and Duane Ave.

Are you a one-of-a-kind kind of man? Unique and very smart? Big-hearted and communicative? We might make beautiful music together.

I'm passionate, selective, educated and kind, in search of a man with similar qualities, a professional Gentleman with a high standard for himself, as I have for myself, who is also seeking, ultimately, a real and loving relationship. 

We are far from perfect but we hopefully have emotional and physical affinities. Hard to find, but is one to stop looking because it's rare?
I haven't given up...yet.

Let's get to know each other as friends first, perhaps enjoying wine-tastings, concerts, walks by the water and light hiking/ walks in the park, dinner and/or drinks out (or in, when that feels right) and other fun pursuits together. 

Too intense too soon, in my opinion, doesn't usually work too well.
Open to dating other races.
I'd love to see a photo and know something about you. Looks are less important to me than the chemistry factor, mutual espect and compatibility.

Please, include your approximate location, your age, and photo if you reply. 
And please be 50 plus

So let's be honest. I don't want to be on CL, but all the websites are the same. So I figure this is just as good as something like Match.

Hello,
I am looking to start with a beer, no promises. I am big on chemistry and enjoy to laugh. I am easy going, but am serious when it comes to dating and getting to know people. I have a child and am looking to act with a long term vision in mind. I live a very active lifestyle and try to be as healthy as possible. Although, I do believe in balance and having fun as much as I can. I can offer you a good conversation and a possibility to get to know me. I am a jeans and sandal kind of girl, so no need to get all fancy. I would like to get together tonight for a beer at the beer garden and see what happens....please include a picture and your phone number if you are comfortable. Also, let me know what your favorite beer is in the subject line.

I'm pretty jaded in relationships so I'm not looking to rush into anything but I may change my mind for the right person. I moved out here in December and haven't had much luck meeting anyone so here goes. Given that Arizona is so conservative I am convinced the progressive left-wingers have an underground secret organization that meets at an undisclosed location they secretly refer to as proletariat hall. 

I am an L.A native but have lived all over California and arrived here from Atlanta. I tend to get along with progressive, feminist individuals but since I find essential identity statements to be problematic I don't label myself as such. 

I recently joined the gym and find myself super intimidated by it. I would like to meet someone who would be up for some gym time and won't laugh at me when I fall off the treadmill. However, if someone else falls on their ass it's completely ok to point and laugh at them. The last time I joined a gym I went twice in three months so I hope this attempt goes better. 

I'm pretty nerdy and dorky with a mean streak at times. I tend to be socially awkward at times and I'm really crass and blunt so you'll need some thick skin to hang out with me. I tend to be attracted to nerdy white boys, especially when they're younger than me (I used to live in a college town and it's what I got used to). 


Well I don't know what else to write so I hope someone who has a membership to lifetime fitness in Tempe comes across this and responds. If you actually read this write your favorite band name in the subject line. For me it's bad religion =D pic for pic

Happy hunting!

I'm searching for a genuine guy that truly wants to settle down and start the next phase of his life.

I'm a sincerely nice and caring person who is seeking another nice and caring person to be with.

The guy I'm looking for is the following:

Kind and respectful to others.

He is caring and genuine. He likes helping other people. He is not selfish or self centered in any way.

He has a sense of humor.

He doesn't judge other people, but has an open mind.

He considers his health to be important.

He likes being outdoors.

He truly wants to be in a long term relationship in which both people support one another. He believes that we are in a partnership and on this journey together. He is a fantastic listener. We both believe in making the other a better person. We both truly understand and accept one another for who we are. I have my walls up, but they will come down for the right person.

If you truly are these things, please respond. If you are not, then let's not waste each other's time.

If I am being serious, I expect the other person to take me seriously as well.

2. Must be ok with baggage (I have a beautiful 2 year old son)
3. Must want more children- 2 would be nice
4. Would be nice if you loved the Beatles and U2 as much as I do.
5. Love dogs, never owned one, must love cats, not a crazy cat lady, I just love them
6. Must love to travel, see movies, enjoy Giants games, theater, opera and museums

Signs of spring are everywhere. Driving yesterday and feeling the warm air and the sunshine, it just got to my heart.

Another spring with no one to kiss, no one to share coffee with, no one to invite home to dinner, no one real and sincere. Not much I can do about it.

I am looking for a good real and honest coffee date, with possibilities. It all has to begin somewhere. I've done countless coffee dates and only a handful have turned out to be great friends of mine, lovers or loved ones that turned into real relationships. In the past 10 years ago I would be automatically invited to a nice lunch or dinner because men then were not afraid to get involved. Not one except a really poor guy, asked for me to pay for us. And I did. These days I seem to attract the guys with the empty paper cup that try to get freebies from Starbucks, and that's not cool with me. If you can't afford to buy yourself and/or me a cup of coffee, please don't meet me. I don't want to meet you. It tells me a lot about a man who is down and out, but a man should be able to come up with coffee money if he does the inviting, true?

Anyway spring is around the corner and the days are long. I wish to meet someone who is single or divorced, from the San Francisco Bay Area, not married, not a heavy smoker or heavy drinker (I don't drink). Not someone into alternative lifestyles, just a regular joe. Not someone who is bald because I have a great fear of bald men, something from my past and stuck in my mind.

I have my own problems and deficiencies. I am not skinny, I have some minor health issues, I am NOT an athletic woman, so I don't hike, kayak or climb mountains.
My ideal date is coffee and talking, a bit of walking. Lunch, talk and sharing the sunshine and that lunch could lead to another meet if we like each other.

I am not asking for much here, so please don't crucify me, that happened a few days ago.

Please only write if you are open to meet an educated, honest and thoughtful woman with gray/blonde hair, brown eyes, short and some weight on her.
Insults are not welcome and will just be deleted.

You long for my body , submission & obedience,
You long for all of me,
Except my heart, 
And my soul you forgot.
Metal on my ankles,
Rope around my wrist;
Striking whips flogging my back,
My true self alluring and mysterious
My erotic nature your freedom of lust.
My submission, my need as well as yours,
For i fulfill all of your secret erotic hopes
So I am now, and always will be,
Desired by all, loved by none. 
For I tell you now,
The cross I stand against 
Is my cross to bare.

I want to live, I want to give.
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
It's these expressions I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold,
And I'm getting old.

Neil Young's words capture how I feel about finding a man who -- like me -- has a heart of gold.

If you're the one I seek, you're a kind, compassionate, caring gentleman between the ages of 60 and 75 who lives close enough to me so we can play together frequently. I'm hoping you share these qualities that describe me: educated, intelligent, and articulate; energetic and engaged; a non-smoker (of tobacco) but appreciator of wine, spirits, and the herb (all in moderation); financially stable and socially progressive.

Physically, I am of average height and weight (5'4""/~138 lbs.), and considered pretty/attractive...but attraction is personal. While I appreciate lifestyle differences, I'm best matched with a man who -- like me -- is Caucasian, monogamous, and omnivorous. I am interested only in men who are legally and emotionally available -- i.e., single, divorced, or widowed, and not currently partnered.

If you would like to start a conversation, I hope you'll reply to tell me about yourself and why you think we might be a good match. Be sure to include your age and location, and attach a photo. I am happy to reciprocate if we seem well matched.

Last week I was gifted tickets to the Giants vs A's game tomorrow and do not know anyone who can make it. I *really* would like to go so I am throwing in the towel of last resorts and posting here. I figure it could also be a fun way to meet someone new, I've only been single since December so I am trying to get back into meeting new people. 

I am brunette and 5'8. I work out a few times a week, I am smart but not stuffy. I work at a dotcom where I do internet things. I am pretty friendly and can talk to people easy enough. A lot of time I am being smart ass yet I remain crafty. 

Looking for someone my age (32) or older and located in the city. Usually I get a long with other geek-like types but that isn't always a thing. It is necessary that you know how to be chivalrous or at least remember the crap your mom taught you. 

If any of this sounds appealing, email me back. Send some info about yourself and a description or picture. It's a light work day, so I'll check email throughout the day :)

To make a pretend captcha test, email with the name of your favorite baseball team in the subject line. I'm orange all the way! Cheers to all!

Originally from Europe. I live now for many years here in the USA, and like it very much! So how can I describe myself? First, I am real, do not play games (so I love scrabble besides other games), am centered, funny and can be goofy at times, choose to see life from a positive view, have a zest for life and love it! Love the outdoors, am ecologically very aware, more on the liberal side.
I am a very friendly, passionate and romantic, calm, warm hearted, caring, intelligent, very educated, open minded, energetic, very active and creative. 

Am more softspoken, sensitive yet strong, and seek my partner, best friend and soulmate. Some of the qualities I seek in my partner are kindness, compassion, is passionate, sensual, very affectionate and romantic. ""walks his talk', knows what he wants, can communicate his feelings and also has some form of spiritual practice.

I have many interests, some of them are: reading, literature, arts, music, going to bookstores where I can get lost at times, creative projects, cooking, theater, writing, and much more. I dont like to be around angry or negative people, dislike drama, life is too short for that. I see the glass half full, like to focus on the good in life by choice. I am interested in spirituality, consciousness studies, mysticism, philosophy, environmental issues, Ayurvedic medicine, mediation, yoga, tantra (tantric spirituality and philosophy, and yes its more than just sex!), and am learning more about it. 

When you write back to me let me know how to get in contact with you (by email), am sincere in my search and a picture is greatly appreciated! I am looking forward to hear back from you, and the best of luck on your search

In my late 40s I finally found the courage to leave my job as a graphic designer and pursue my passion for food. It was part of a long maturing process that also involved creating a healthy distance between myself and my emotionally crippled family. My interest in nutrition soon led to an excitement about cooking and eventually to my becoming a health-oriented personal chef. My individuation from my family and their white-bread-and-mayonnaise values has led to the discovery of myself as a person who is willing to feel deeply, act boldly and think creatively. I want to be with a man who has also become his own person, who considers life an adventure and who has time for romance, intimacy and me.

In my work I help others cook better, host cooking/dinner parties, and cater dinner parties. I'm interested in exploring the science as well as practicing the art of cooking. It would be be great to be with someone who enjoys food and who likes to be the kitchen but I'm capable of being drawn into your world as well if you truly love what you do.

A good match for me is someone who . . ..

...wants to make a difference (big or small scale).
. . .is happy to take the scenic route to just about anywhere
. . .is charmed by down-in-the valley views just as much as bird's-eye vistas.
. . .wants to explore the world --cultures and history-- through food and people, cities and the countryside
....likes to be active, has all-day energy.


Religion has no appeal to me - but I'm definitely intrigued with ""spirituality"" (am using this for a lack of a better word). Meaning to say, I'm interested in understanding that what's there but cannot be seen.

Community involvement is important to me, I'm active with the South Bay sustainable food movement. Will soon start a two-year term as president of a nonprofit.

Friends? Family? Kids? I have several very close friends, and consider them my family. I raised 4 step children with ex husband in the 90s/early 00s.

Still have my full-suspension mtn bike, panniers, snorkel, backpack, sleeping bag, downhill ski equipment, X-country ski boots, snowshoes. ...and want to do all these activities with a partner,

Eventually, I want to golf, have really enjoyed it the couple of times I've played. And I want to play the piano again, and ride a horse again. I would love to be a good singer and hope to someday take lessons, bonus if I find someone who likes to sing (together). And I love to dance ... the waltz, tango, swing. I'm not one who needs perfection, just enjoyment in a shared activity.

Love yoga, hiking, once or twice a week. I run, occasionally. I like to bike and hope you are ok with me --a slow poke-- some distance behind you. I actually like to fish (shore or boat --jigging, casting, slabbing), I don't have the gear or make a point of going, but will definitely join my partner.

I thoroughly enjoy concerts and live theater; not much of a fan of opera or spectator sports.

I'm exploring and expanding my emotional range with those who are close to me.. It feels like the key to getting the most out of life.

I'm looking for a man with a true heart of gold. A man that puts other people's feelings and needs before his own. Someone who is empathetic, and actually knows what that means. Someone who cares about his impact on the world and in other peoples lives. Someone who is generous to the less fortunate. Someone who is stable in his career and his lifestyle. Hopefully someone who also has kids that are older (or no kids) but that's not a dealbreaker. I Am not having more kids of my own so if that's in your plans, that is a deal breaker.

I am looking for a man who is passionate for his work and is family orientated. I like to be around people who can keep up with me in regards to adventure eating, exploring the city, seeing movies or simply staying in. I prefer someone who is a working professional looking for the same thing. I don't tolerate someone who takes drugs or heavily drinks. My age range for dating is 25-30. I am simply looking for someone who is equally as serious as me.

Yes, I am looking to settle down with the right guy - he's caring, family oriented, kind, and is an all around great human being. He cares about his health and wants to start a family at some point.

I consider myself to be a nice person. I like working out, sports (Niners, Warriors), watching movies, and being outdoors. I think respect is important. Being a good listener is also important. Sensitivity is also important. Arrogance and a self centered nature are a big turnoff.

I want to be in a partnership in which we build one another up and support one another. This is important.
It's important to have a positive influence on one another.

Hello!

I live around the Nob/Russian Hill are of San Francisco. I am looking for a male friend to hang out with and possibly more if the connection is there. If no spark, at least we found a new friend in the hood!

If anything I say interests you. Send me a note and hopefully we can meet up soon!

Activities: golfing. hiking, biking and swimming. I drink alcohol, but do not smoke. I would classify my style as sporty. I am not a picky eater and enjoy the restaurants around the area. I am an early riser and love getting up early on the weekends. If I chill at home, I tend to watch shows oriented around science. I guess I am
a bit geeky that way. I love working out outside but hate the gym. I belong to a gym for the outside pool. :) A lot of my friends are married with kids and to be honest my life is way different than most of my friends. So here I am looking to find a like minded guy.

First things first: I'm not looking for a hook-up or a FWB! If that's all you're looking for, please don't message me! I'm also not into hanging out for only a week, so I'm not interested in guys who are on vacation in the area. 

I'm Filipina (born and raised in the USA), cute, short (at just about 5'1"") and would consider myself a small BBW that carries herself well and I also have a great smile. I'm looking for someone to become friends with, with the possibility of a long term relationship, but I'm definitely not trying to rush anything. I really do want to find that special someone to share laughter and life with. I'm quirky, love sarcasm, can be quiet at times, but I'm outgoing and friendly, and know how to let loose and have fun. I have a good head on my shoulders, have manners, and know how to behave in public. I have no tolerance for liars, cheaters, or guys who are still in love with their ex. 

I'm attracted to white guys (that's pretty much all I'm attracted to, so it's very obvious to see who didn't actually read this) and it's important that you're single with no kids, non-ghetto, and non-cigarette smoking. I'm looking for someone in the age range of 27-37 and within a reasonable distance to central Contra Costa. 

If you're interested after reading this, send me an email with a face picture. I have plenty to trade! =)

. . .just one man who is age-appropriate (60-75), close in geography (I live mid-peninsula), and similarly inclined (read on).

Neither of us is currently partnered, and we crave the steadfast companionship and deep intimacy we have experienced and expressed in past monogamous relationships. Living long has made us far wiser than we were in our youth. We acknowledge our imperfections and recognize that understanding, compassion, affection, and acceptance are essential to a lasting relationship.

We are both intelligent, articulate people, active and involved, socially and politically liberal, and financially stable. We're still healthy, energetic, and attractive, and we intend to keep ourselves that way for many years to come.

Here are some specifics about me:

I am HWP (5'4"" tall, ~137 lbs.) and Caucasian. Raised east-coast Jewish, for the past two decades I have been an active member of a progressive religious community that includes people of all persuasions. I am omnivorous, and get along best with those similarly inclined. Semi-retired now, I continue to seek ways to contribute my experience and energy to people and projects that make a difference in the world. Among the pastimes I enjoy are music and dancing, puzzles, cooking and savoring good food and beverage, hiking and exploring (especially with my canine companion), flowers and plants, computers and the Internet, movies and some TV, home maintenance and renovation. My social and political leanings are decidedly liberal/progressive.

If you resonate with this post, I hope you'll write to tell me about yourself (age and location are essential!), what you're looking for, why you're responding. When you do, please attach a current photo; I will happily reciprocate if we seem to be a match.

About me: 

Very pretty SWF, size 4, a looker!

Avid runner 
Yoga practitioner 
Love all things pink and purple

I love the woods 
I love staying up late and seeing the dawn, lazy Sundays in bed with you 

I love to have fun and cut up with someone special - once a special relationship has been established 
Trying to teach myself Italian (slow process) 

A smart, quick thinking man is the ultimate turn-on for me 
I am delightful, delicious, demure, even dainty, subtle, sweet, sexy. 

The type of man I seek: 
I am seeking a successful, confident, and intelligent SWM, 56-72, who knows how to enjoy life. 
A man who will break his routine and try something new, or maybe try something new that he did not enjoy 7 years ago, 
like to learn a new language, a new dance, a new sport (i.e. - cross-country skiing). 

I am seeking a man who is looking for one woman to be his partner - a man who wants a longterm companion to engage in discovery with. 
Prefer a SWM who is well-educated (grad. degrees), sensitive and moved by nature, animals and the arts, a gentleman, kind to everyone 
(including waiters :-), 
successful in his chosen profession and he should still be excited about his professional work. 

Note - a man who dreads his work would not be a good match for me. 

Important - you must be truly single - not separated or married. Age IS important - I look very young - but I am Not attracted to young men. 
I am interested in meeting a SWM between the ages of 56-72. 

An interesting letter and your photo will turn my head and increase the chances that we meet. 
Please respond with a descriptive letter. Picture a Must for a response.

It could mean...

Segmentation & Reassembly I've felt like that sometimes, you probably have too so I'll take it

****IF YOU ARE MARRIED, ATTACHED OR IN BETWEEN RELATIONSHIP PRESS THE BACK BUTTON**** 

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!! I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY DICK PICTURES!! Its rude and disrespectful!!

So I know you're real, please type: TODAY'S DATE

I am single and happy.I am not desperate and I don't miss the drama, I do however miss the intimacy. 
I am looking for someone who is interested and UNDERSTANDS the meaning of FWB & hopefully to grow to a potential long term. I am looking for someone to have fun with, explore the rivers, or a simple hike by the beaches. I know summer is far but soon enough it will hit us quickly. That said crazy rainy weather doesn't stop me from exploring the outside. I don't mind having dinner and have a beer with you and see what teams are playing that night. If we hit it off I don't mind to have some adult play behind closed doors I am game! 

PLEASE NOTE: I am not interested in meaningless sex. So if you're here visiting or you have business in the bay area, I am not interested.

I am simple, single Mexican American woman, 38 years old.I have brown hair and eyes, light skin, nice smile.Oh yes I am on the thick/ chubby side (please don't hate) I am working on it. I live in the peninsula work in SF. I am easy going, funny, a bit on the sarcastic side, I can be all around goof ball and can be serious when I need to be. I don't like drama & I DO express myself. 

I am looking for a guy who SINGLE!!! HAS TIME and share the similar same interest. Someone who is honest and could be communicative with me. I ask that you be close to my age (I am 38 years old) but not old that you look like my grandfather. Please send a recent clear picture and I will do the same in return. Oh one last thing you must be in the age between 33-45ish. Not interested in young kids. 

P.S - My apologies in advance for delay of response but you will get a response from me. 

Thanks.

body : thin height : 5'8"" status : single
age: 57

Hi!
Please read everything before replying, thx. 
Not looking for sex...life is not all about sex... It is mostly about everything else other than sex... Not everybody can or wants to have sex.
Romantic dates don't require it... Example; a romantic dinner with wine and a walk on the beach, a romantic night out at a ballroom concert, a romantic movie... A candle light dinner at home... Etc. 
Therefore, I'm looking for an older man who wants all the fun things that a close loving relationship offers without the requirement of sex. If all you want is sex, try the Casual Encounters section. That's where the trash is.... Not here. 

About me; I am near 60 and unable to work due to aches & pains but I can walk and get around pretty good otherwise. I am hoping to find someone like me. Maybe you are older than me (I hope ). 
Maybe you are retired and live alone. 
Maybe you want someone who needs a little help, someone to spend your days/evenings with, someone to take a short walk with, shop with, see a movie with, go out to eat with. Someone like you!

This paragraph devoted to being upfront. 
It wouldn't matter to you that I don't have a job because I just can't work with this body that is beautiful but painful, or that I had a surgery last year and so now I am a transgendered female (yes I am all female and I have legal notorized proof which says I am to be considered female, a woman, therefore, I am here in w4m). I am told I look good. I know there are alot of you who are good with that because I meet you everyday wherever I go. 

I am kind of quiet & shy. But I don't mind cooking! 

If I sound like someone you would like to talk to and maybe meet, REPLY TO THIS POSTING, and please send a picture so I can also send you one. If not, just move on to the next posting. 

Thanks!

Maybe I do want something more... I'm a very laid back, fun, smart, sexy and even funny most times. I'm eSy to get along with and the last person to judge anyone. I just want someone who can appreciate the little things... I want to have a connection with someone... That only makes the sex even better, when you know that's not the only thing your good for... Don't get me wrong, sex is amazing but when you have a connection with someone...something about that makes it worth going to hell for.

Hello,

You - gentle, single not married or separate, available and seeking a real relationship; wise, smart, kind, fit, etc.

I'm super clean and tidy. I enjoy winter at Tahoe. I'm well manner and dress up for occasion. I studied some fashion design. I can be a personal image consultant for you.

I like star war and start trek movies. I am conservative who dresses well with styles; but I prefer to be in my comfort zone. I'm conservative and don't want a man who want his woman to show her body (meat - sexy dress high heel shoes) to public to get or drawing men attention. 

I'm a beautiful Chinese lady who is blessed with beautiful parents. I am smart but humble, elegant but not arrogant, strong but feminine, etc. I don't need alcohol to enjoy myself. Further I don't sit on the computer answering/reading CL ads. I do laundry, fixing house when there is unexpected problem occurs; such as door lock broke, etc. I'm not a handy woman but I have to fix it myself and learn it. 

At middle age, there is no time for a dating game or catch me if you can. That is not in Asian culture. Can we live together as housemates with respect .. just to see if we can connect our Mental, Spiritual, and physical at soul level. 

I've been told as being too honest and kind. I'm looking for a real love and deep meaningful relationship. You don't know someone until you live together.. habits, behavior, values, life styles; i.e., food, getup early or late owl, etc. These factors people fail and never look at these issues. 

Would it be better if we can live together and see how we interact with out sex first? For example, I get up early and go to bed early as 9 to 10. I am super clean and tidy. Do you think I would live with a sloppy smoker and drunker when I don't smoke or drink? I'm a light sleeper and can't stand a man who snores. Gosh! I learned one of My brother snores as thunder! We sleep in one studio because we are very poor in Thailand. I have a job here but I can't live in a nice apartment with a bath tub as I am in the US. 

Education does not make one better than others if you are lacked of wisdom and virtue. Lustful life is not the same as lustful love. Once your heart committed to the woman you are madly love then Your heart will be burning. That lustful desire made sex enjoyable. Sadly, people just rush to have sex before you want to get to know each other. I'm looking for a man who would look at me in the eyes and say, ""I want to know your heart desire.""

I'm looking for a man (asian prefer) 50 to 60 and want to retire and live in Asia, Australia, near by. I will leave the US and return home to care for my 76 years old mother. If you are educated, kind, Spiritual, humble gentleman, who is a non smoker, drug, clean, tidy, normal. and is sincerely seeking a soulmate; ring the bell!

Please send good picture of yourself . Tell me what areas you are living, and bio. The men in my family are 6 feet but the women are 5 feet to 5'4. You will have to look at my brothers in the eyes! 

NO SMOKER! 
No Alcholic or ex alcholic. Non drinker prefer
Please do not wear any lotion or.
I am allergic to perfume, cigarette, liquor, etc. Serious break out and chemical reaction!
I eat mostly fruits and vegetables. 
My family is uneducated and I got college degree which means to get me a job interview. Seriously college degree is a waste of money. I wish I could be a performer as my parents who were sold into Chinese opera under 7 years of age. Life is hard. I appreciate life and what I have and I want a man who is down to earth and won't look down on my family. Can it be you?

I'm not perfect but I'm trying to live and be a good human; be kind to others; as the Buddha teaching. I'm a spiritualist.

I need a man who is older than me. Does this mean I need a ""papa"" whom I never had? Oh, please, we shall leave this for our ""special private games"". But first of all I need a mature husband, who will feel my own maturity beyond the age. I see you as a strong man, hard-working and respectful, who will see my personality, but also never forget about my body. Be passionate, be daring. And let's change the world together! Oh, of course I am speaking not of the whole world, but about our own, which we will build together, and which is called ""family."" You do not need to take pity on me, as I am not pitiful at all. Trust me and be worthy of my trust, speak openly from the very beginning - playing with words won't work for us, because we prefer action, right? I do hope you also love to travel.

Hi There!

When I've posted before I've described myself first and what I'm looking for second. I'm reversing the order this time in the hope that I'll get fewer replies that are way outside what I'm looking for. For example, more than 10 years younger (or older) than I am isn't what I mean by ""reasonably close to my age"". So here goes.

WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR:
Please live in San Francisco (or at least close to a nearby BART station), be taller than I am, and reasonably close to my age.

I'm looking for a long-term - hopefully life-long relationship with someone who wants a companion for hiking/biking/walks, intellectual pursuits, cooking/eating, humor, and emotional/physical intimacy - a close friend and lover.

ABOUT ME:
I am warm, intelligent, passionate, and in good shape. I exercise daily (usually by bicycling up to Twin Peaks). I have green eyes and dark brown, wavy hair. I'm 5'8"".

Some of the things I enjoy include hiking and bicycling or just wandering around San Francisco. I love animals and nature, and had 2 cats until recently. I like all kinds of restaurants, independent and foreign movies, cooking and sharing a delectable meal at home. I'm an avid reader, listen to NPR a lot, and am a subscriber to City Arts & Lectures. I'm fairly well-traveled (lived in Europe for 8-1/2 years) and would like to do more - especially in Africa and Central & South America.

If the above resonates with you, please tell me a little about yourself and send me a photo. Let's meet for a drink of some kind and get to know each other.

I am looking for a good man with high moral and family values for marriage in the future. I'm tired of living alone and want to share my life. My roommate asked 'why you stay single.

I'm 53, you 53 to 65
I never smoke, drink alcohol, or on drug. You should be too. I practice Buddhist philosophy, LDS member because of their values align with mine. I'm not religious but spiritual; open mind, Trekky, Star War Fan! Passion for History! Hook on Korean Drama!

I'm respectful, loyal, sincere in action and words. I am a peaceful person who can't kill even animal. I am supporting my family (mom, and brothers) oversea because the government keeps the people poor and harsh life. You must understand and respect; open to help me.

Graduate degree; I am not a good writer and my English is better than some Americans who can't read or write; yet I'm not perfect. I can speak 4 languages but you can only speak English. Some man will write to cut me down from CL. I got a few of that. These men are so smart and know only English. I will be happy to reply to them in other language.

I'm very poor. My family can't read or write. None of them have education and we only live in one rectangular room in Thailand. With a graduate degree, I will always be looked down as poor low class in my country. 

I made bad choice to buy a condo last August. I'm selling it and move back to the Bay. I'm in Sacto. It wipes out my saving. I'm open to a live in situation to see if we are compatible. Currently I'm going through a career change. I'm targeting a job at the University. For this reason, I got a graduate degree. I like working around intelligent being and international students and environment.

Join me, write and answer the same format I have of what qualities you have as my match.
At this age, I'm not active in sport, gym, etc. I'm too busy and I am very tired. I just want a life where I don't have to drive so much. I want to be able to stay home, sewing, enjoy cooking new receipt, go walking, etc

Someone has shared this short instruction for single seniors, and I'm posting it in here with my comments.
Yes, I'm a Single 63 y.o. good-looking woman, young in heart and body, and I am attempting to resonate with the heart of a Super Serious Educated Gentleman, Who wants to be in a Committed Relationship. 
Ready to read the text?

""Lots of single seniors stumble through online dating instead of dating smart.""
I'm wondering what is ""smart dating"". . . Of course, dating a coworker whom one knows for a long time would be the best. I my case it's not possible as I'm a privately working teacher.

""Integrity, emotional intelligence, kindness, and compassion, are a few examples of qualities that might make your list, but there are many others.""
Certainly, there are the others, but those listed above are most important. 

""Physical appearance, wealth, social status, and other surface qualities are not substitutes for the meaningful, inner qualities on your list.""
Physical appearance is strongly connected to the inner beauty, and women are no less visual than men, but no one looks for the correctness of features. Everybody Reads a Lot in the Eyes. Mine are big hazel, looking straight and smiling. You can easily read my thought in them. Unlike many ladies who look like cats, I tell what I think and do what I tell. I risk to open up and face the pain of misunderstanding, but I'll never try to hide anything or Use Anybody.
""Love at first sight is a senior, newbie dating fantasy guaranteed to fail whether you're the one doing the sweeping or being swept. Seniors are too experienced to still believe in love at first sight, which only happens in the movies.""
Right, but what about just FEELING who another person is at the 1st sight? Eye expression, language (vocabulary, choice of expressions), the sound of a voice do help a lot to know instantly about what can be expected from a person.

""When a senior dater falls in love based on physical attraction that's actually lust at first sight, and suggests desperation"".
Right, desperation or just stupidity.

""Dinner at a romantic restaurant is not a smart first date choice because it doesn't serve either person's purposes.""

Of course, even in the times when everything moves fast, going to the restaurant, usually followed by sharing a bed ( am I wrong?) can only witness the total absence of the Seriousness. It's ONLY for one-night stands.
""If you really want to get to know someone on a first date, which is the purpose of a first date anyway, chat with them over coffee for an hour. You're far more likely to ask the tough questions if you're not floating in a romantic bubble, and a second date will be easier to determine after you asked the important questions. ""

""Sex on a first or second date isn't a realistic path to fall in love. In fact it will have the exact opposite effect. Sex too soon brings the getting to know you aspect of a relationship to a screeching halt because sex becomes the relationship's focus rather than discovering each other on a deeper level first. And the relationship typically ends a few months later when a couple begins to see each other more clearly.""

So, we are talking about the online meetings? Of course, any Normal Person Before Meeting someone should learn much. . . Pretty often the process of learning is hard, and people part before an initial meeting. There are so many paths that lead to misunderstanding, that it takes a good effort to appreciate and see the real person behind the words. 

I insist on using SKYPE as it lets people discover a lot instantly.

It's the very beginning though!

Greetings.

English isn't my native language. Although I'm fluent, I believe there is something in my Tone that is hard to appreciate and understand to Americans.
I've decided to re-phrase some American woman's profile and tell about Myself this way.
See what I've got.

""Hazel-eyed, intellectually insightful, aesthetically inclined, sensitive, spiritual, nature grounded. I like words!
Interested in co-creation of a new chapter of LIFE with wit and laughter, depth and daring. Appreciating challenging stimulation combined with peaceful calm. 
Youthful in body and mind, energetic and engaged with the world, 
valuing kindness, integrity, creativity, humility, humor, wisdom.

In early 60's, attractive, active, artistic, aware, mature and childlike.

Seeking LOVE - to love and be loved, for the rest of our lives, 
starting with mind commonalities, and kind, great heart, then body, spirit pervading all. ""

So, that woman and I look alike indeed, at least because we Like Words, Depth of the Spirit and Arts. Also, at 60+ we can act very young. Unlike too many prostitute-like ""sirens"", we, NORMAL ladies, look for a KINDRED SPIRIT. All the rest comes next!

We are also alike in Not Getting Responses from Quality Men. That woman and I want you to TELL about yourself, your interests, BELIEFS, pursuits, circumstances. Please, use a good effort to introduce yourself. Your image may get mine if I feel we may connect.

LONG INTRODUCTION

I am a Very Slavic (Ukrainian/ Belarusian) Woman. To be a Slavic woman of my generation means to be Caring, Supportive and Responsible, Well-Educated, Sensitive, Straightforward, Pretty Old-Fashioned, with a strong sense of how a decent woman should act in this ""unleashed"" world of online dating. 

I'm still 62 ( will turn 63 soon), 5.6, average built, dark-haired, hazel-eyed, nice looking.

And, Yes, I Can Support Myself. 

As any woman, I don't like politics and even consider it to be a dirty business, but nowadays politics is everywhere, and, I think, we can't afford our attempts to stay away. I've been helping victims of the war in Ukraine, protesters against KGB in Russia. My nonprofit school, which can operate as charity, tries to help people connect and help each other. 

I am a proud mother of two beautiful, well-educated daughters, who are in their 30s, married and on their own.

I have lived in US since 2002 and am its citizen. Educator (teacher of music and languages), small school owner, very passionate about my work and children (not only my own). Those little ones refresh my heart and brain and help me stay connected to that little Ukrainian girl in me.

Do you know that ""it's tiring for children to explain everything to adults,"" and that only the adult who is capable of saving a child in his soul is worthy? 

MUSIC: As a classically trained piano teacher, I do love the music I teach. That doesn't mean that my partner has to be in love with it. If you are frustrated that you don't like opera, I can tell you that I do not like Giants and golf:-) and will Never go to watch them with you.

I'm NOT a PARTY PERSON at all. I feel extremely bored there. 

I do love Literature, including poetry, and I teach Russian language and literature ( have a degree) 

HOW I AM DRESSED: yes, most of the time I'm dressed-up like any Slavic woman at work. But I do like to hike, to bike, and to camp.

Although I'm Open, Honest and Strong, I'm OPPOSITE to feminists. There is a good room for a man, whom I'm looking for, by my side.

I would say I am TRANSPARENT. Are you too?

And so on and on... I do have a lot to say, and I hope you too!

What? You just had to click on the title right? Gotta love Cl for entertainment, as I read late night and click on the titles to laugh too.

Ok... am I soooo hot you are wondering? I have realized this is LA and smoking hot is perfect tight body, and the rest is discretionary if they like the hot latina look, white girl next door, smoking black girl. SO no to the perfect hot body, as I am about HWP, and believe always a work in progress striving to be more fit, more activities, and if had a partner bet that would help.

Am I really eating Bon Bons on the couch? No I would rather just run them along my forehead, down my neck, down until...... Snap out of it!!! Bet you can fill in the where the until goes in your imagination right? lol.

I am getting in better shape as the on going thing, so Bon Bons out for the moment. However something added in to getting in shape on the couch would work..... like watching a movie, snuggling, kissing, and what the heck was that movie we attempted to watch.... would be in over Bon Bons.

So now that I have your attention and imagination, can you share it with me and let me know what is going on in your life, what you seek, and deliver it with some intelligence and wit preferably, include your age, stats, location, interests, so we can see if we click and are in the same time and place?

ME??? I am white female, about HWP, just over 5' 8"", not bad to look at as been called pretty, girl next door, good looking, and depending what I wear lets you come up with other adjectives and adverbs. What Grammar in this too? Is this a CL post?

Do not make me into something I am not, as you guys are always dreaming about what us girls ""should"" be, be happy and thankful for who I AM. I will appreciate you for all you are, with all your charms, or lack of them.

I am no Debbie Downer, always positive, and do not have negative people in my life, and keeping it that way. Yes life can take turns, up and down, but is a fun ride and we can hold hands during the twist and turns is my plan. Not a fair weather friend or lover, looking for the same, which is hard in this town. Wait.... it is hard to get a smart or witty communication first, then have similar interests to want to meet second..... and dare I say????? Actually meet!!!!!

So that is what I seek along with occasional drinker as I am; and no smoking, drugs, diseases, drama..... just seeking YOU, a real person with all your charms, but please have some substance to you.

Quite frankly if you do not have some substance, it will not keep my interest. While I am so fun, outgoing, easy going, intelligent, patient, spontaneous, educated, well traveled, witty, and can function in any environment and with any type of person........... I need someone a little versatile as well.

I would rather have a bunch of fun dates with one person that dominoes into more and deeper, than a bunch of shallow dates that yes are fun all the same, but at the end of the day still left yearning for more.

But hey..... I look at this as ""dating"" remember that? Get a connection, have fun in it and see what unfolds, not afraid of what it becomes, it is not what you want you move on? I would love if LA guys would loosen up, enjoy life more in these simple moments we get available for fun.

I am tired of eating Bon Bons on my couch, or at least without a partner..... so use that imagination, wit, brain, and let me know what we, you, would like to see unfold if we meet. Get off your couch too!!! I am already having fun without you, why not join me?

We can make it work in whatever small or large moments we can find. Doesn't need to be all or nothing.... so start living, loving, and enjoying some girl company lacking in your life, as I am missing guy company in mine too. I do not care about anything other than who you are, and what we share in our time, as I believe life is simply better and enhanced when shared.

I'm not a hopeless romantic, not sentimental, not shy, not drama queen, and probably not sweet. So, if you looking for a sweet babe - it's not me. 

I'm realistic but optimistic, opinionated but polite, positive, empathetic but not into a pity party, strong, full of energy and enthusiasm, adventurous but not foolhardy, intelligent and educated. I'm white 46 years old, attractive, and fit. I take care of myself, and have a healthy life style. I prefer outdoor activities - hikes, walks, travel. TV, movies, video games are only for the rainy days, however I would prefer meaningful conversations, and good books. What else? I love to cook, and I do it well. I'm sensual and feminine. I'm very loyal friend.

Who am I looking for? Confident, with good manners man, physically fit, bright, intelligent, with sense of humor, and stable career. Someone who is able to have deep or witty conversations. Friend, lover, soul mate. Between 40 to 50 years old. Tall. Smart. Empathetic. Single or divorced. No alcohol, drugs or other addictions. No drama. 

For the first date I would prefer quiet place where we can talk, I'm not into eating high-calories food or spending hours in a dark theater without a single dialogue. I also don't want to know all cheesy details about your former relationships, and I don't provide therapy sessions.

Did you say you are Educated, Manly and Kind Divorced or Widowed Man?
Read on then...
Do you agree that Love is NOT an emotion but rather a decision? I do! Some artist has elaborated on this subject by saying that ""Love is very emotional as well as a decision. It is from the heart which can even be more intense when coupled with the brain. True chemistry goes beyond sober thinking and rational decisions"".

I TOTALLY agree with him. Still, my statement is valid to keep away those 98% of ""grasshoppers"".

And I've decided to ""steal"" another quote and share with you: 

""There's a difference between romance and intimacy. Romance is about personality, and intimacy is about character. Romance is about the lure of surface chemistry, charm -- your socialized self-playing with somebody else's socialized self. It's superficial stuff and not necessarily long-lasting. Intimacy is about connecting soul-to-soul, character-to-character -- sharing your real self with someone else's real self -- and that's what's necessary for a solid, long-lasting relationship"".

Well said, right? So, I'm looking for a man who understands that statement and agrees with it. 

I want to connect at all levels and am looking for the man who wants the same--unconditional trust and acceptance to build the true intimacy on.

You've already understood that I am Not looking for ""stress reduction"", ""comfort"", banal ""fun"", financial support and so on. I am looking for My Second Wing to Fly (Yes, at This Age!). One- winged people can only fly in circles, which makes them dizzy and unrealistic (would you agree?) 

I am always Very Happy to meet well-educated people as I'm educated, but I do NOT value diplomas for themselves. I Deeply Appreciate Smart, Creative, Brave people with a Heart, including those who have educated themselves on their own, through their life experiences.

I have never met many men coming from dating sites as it's easy to define who Is Not Him just by reading between their lines. 

I have a very little hope to find My Man here... But we all know that important things happen exactly when there is no hope, or, in different words, the night is darker just before the dawn.

""Women should be protected from anyone's exercise of unrighteous power. . .but then, so should every other living creature.""

~ George Eliot When love is born in our hearts, we want only the best for others, for we directly see them as ourselves. The imprisoning illusion of a fundamentally separate self, struggling against other selves for its own rewards, is transcended, and our life becomes dedicated to bringing peace, joy, and fulfillment to others. This brings us our greatest joy, and is the flowering of the highest form of love, which is compassion. We must, if this process is actually happening in us, be drawn toward veganism, and it is in no way a limitation on us, but the harmonious fulfillment of our own inner seeing....Dr. William Tuttles

What do women bring to Life aside of the Life they give to the babies? Yes, Devotion and Beauty. They are your Source of Inspiration, They are less tested by increasing hormone level; that's why usually they are better committed partners than men.
Right?
And you know that the level of civilization should be measured by its attitude to a Woman too? 
Good for you!
Then let's talk a little.

I've just turned 63 (Pisces) . Although not a Grandma yet, and I'm a nice looking youthful in mind and body woman, I know that the biggest part of my journey has been already lived. I need to make its final part full of Dignity and Beauty. 
I'm NOT an American ""gal"" (not Asian or Hispanic nor Hispanic). Guess where attractive women are educated, serious and kind... They are also responsible for their country. Yes, I'm a citizen of yours now...
I'm tired of being a plane with one wing but ready to stay alone till death if my Dignified Knight doesn't appear before. 

I've got education ( multiple degrees), built my career, raised the children and made a certain number of mistakes which I would like to avoid repeating.

It seems to me that what an Intelligent, Decent and Honest woman, looking for a partner for a final chapter of her life, needs to think of is how this man relates to her in terms of :

1)her views and beliefs ( I have a high spirit, believe in education, am opposite to feminists but can't be told what to do by anybody. I greet the wind in the face!), her attitude to politics (I'm active and passionate about what I believe in. In short, I'm an activist), the work she does ( I'm going to never retire as I love my profession and can always work part time, while having an opportunity to choose when and how much to work, and this is my way of expressing myself in life);
2) how compatible their characters are. (I'm peaceful, friendly, dignified, not materialistic and not diplomatic-just desperately sincere and unable to stand insincere, indecisive and fearful beings.) I can't be ""controlled"" by the man as I'm absolutely committed by nature. I will ask for advice myself but won't stand constant ""corrections"". To put it in a nutshell, I'm Not a Follower and Not a Leader. I can only walk by the side of my equal. An ""alpha male"" isn't my match for sure.
3) if they are compatible sexually. By this age, too many men have lost their potency while women, after having given all they should to the children and families, are still up to experiencing the richness of love life with the Men they Can Respect.

Right, it's Very Hard to Meet Such Men on Dating Sites. 

We love with our soul and body, don't we? I'm passionate and intense if in love (You know that Love Is Demanding, right?), and I want to be on fire and to have a chance to TRUST every step my partner makes. I'm a devoted and reliable friend, and I need to feel the reciprocation of the same level; otherwise, my feminine pride will push me to leaving. 

Yes, your Celebrating the Existence of Women is Welcome:-)

When I cross the street people try to hit me with their cars. At night people yell racial slurs at me. In the stores people are kind of nice but they have to be because it's a chain store and they don't want to lose their job. All the other people I have met aren't nice. So, my time I have spent in this town has been lonely but I am rarely here beyond when I am sleep. The college students I have met are nice. 

I'm looking for a nice person not some guy trying to live with me. It's so weird how men at night walk up on me and ask to live with me and say they are religious people. Looking to meet someone nice to hangout with if I ever stay beyond my sleeping hours,

I'm a proud gamer gal (XBOX/PC), bookworm (Shakespeare to graphic novels and a bunch of genres in between - currently reading the Game of Thrones series), music addict (Nine Inch Nails? Yes, please! Frank Sinatra - excellent! Duran Duran? Love it!), creative (a little artsy), sensitive, blessed with a high libido (but no one to share it with - boo!), intelligent, uber-cool sense of humor, offspring-free, ex-spouse-free, drug-free, disease-free, non-smoker, social drinker, financially independent (and prefer that - I'm not looking for someone to financially support me), and way too understanding, honest, and compassionate. But also quite the smart-ass because it's fun to laugh! The Tech Museum is cool, I enjoy the Monterey Bay Aquarium, concerts, wineries, local hikes, Starbucks, and live shows/plays. Some of my favorite shows include The Big Bang Theory, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, Boardwalk Empire, Dexter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Wilfred, and Legit.

Hello,

I'm a very passionate person and I'm filled with the joy of life. I'm looking for my best friend and the love of my life to share all the magic and experiences of living. I own my business and I'm semi-retired. I love to travel and explore. I enjoy walking, hiking, jogging, water and the mountains, traveling in the US and in Europe, night life in the cities, most kinds of food, a nice glass of red wine with dinner and exploring.

I am into Spirituality, not religion. I enjoy writing stories and poems, playing with watercolors, and sipping tea/coffee over engaging conversation. I'm close to downtown Los Gatos and would prefer someone in the south bay area.

I enjoy playing in the mud (gardening), old classic movies and I'm having a lot of fun writing a novel.

I'm really good at communicating with people, having fun and enjoying life. I'm a good listener and I love talking with people. I am a curious person and people are very interesting to me. I also naturally validate people as I notice what people are doing/saying. I do it with sincerity and a loving heart. 

The first things people usually notice about me is I'm very warm, friendly, and easy to be with. I naturally encourage people. I notice nature and truly appreciate all the beauty that surrounds us. 

I enjoy reading the work of Colum McCann. I love the poet Rumi, Sci-fi, Scott Orsen Card, books about investing and real estate, and about quantum physics, reading Michio Kaku, Amit Goswami, PhD, and a good novel.

I love being close, family, having fun, new experiences and new thoughts, relaxing, being creative, noticing and appreciating nature and the magic of life. 

I spend a lot of time thinking about being intimate with my beloved, traveling and having adventures. cuddling, flirting. playing, talking, watching a movie and being together. 

Please message me if you laughed recently and would like to meet for tea/coffee. 

I wish you well and lots of love!

LONG INTRODUCTION

I am a Very Slavic (Ukrainian/ Belarusian) Woman. To be a Slavic woman of my generation means to be Caring, Supportive and Responsible, Well-Educated, Sensitive, Straightforward, Pretty Old-Fashioned, with a strong sense of how a decent woman should act in this ""unleashed"" world of online dating. 

I'm still 62 ( will turn 63 soon), 5.6, average built, dark-haired, hazel-eyed, nice looking.

And, Yes, I Can Support Myself. 

As any woman, I don't like politics and even consider it to be a dirty business, but nowadays politics is everywhere, and, I think, we can't afford our attempts to stay away. I've been helping victims of the war in Ukraine, protesters against KGB in Russia. My nonprofit school, which can operate as charity, tries to help people connect and help each other. 

I am a proud mother of two beautiful, well-educated daughters, who are in their 30s, married and on their own.

I have lived in US since 2002 and am its citizen. Educator (teacher of music and languages), small school owner, very passionate about my work and children (not only my own). Those little ones refresh my heart and brain and help me stay connected to that little Ukrainian girl in me.

Do you know that ""it's tiring for children to explain everything to adults,"" and that only the adult who is capable of saving a child in his soul is worthy? 

HOW I AM DRESSED: yes, most of the time I'm dressed-up like any Slavic woman at work. But I do like to hike, to bike, and to camp,.

MUSIC: As a classically trained piano teacher, I do love the music I teach. That doesn't mean that my partner has to be in love with it. If you are frustrated that you don't like opera, I can tell you that I do not like Giants and golf:-) and will Never go with you to watch them.

I'm NOT a PARTY PERSON at all. I feel extremely bored there. 

I do love Literature, including poetry, and I teach Russian language and literature ( have a degree) 

Although I'm Open, Honest and Strong, I'm OPPOSITE to feminists. There is a good room for a man, whom I'm looking for, by my side.

I would say I am TRANSPARENT. Are you too?

And so on and on... I do have a lot to say, and I hope you too!

Someone has shared this short instruction for single seniors, and I'm posting it in here with my comments.
Yes, I'm a Single 63 y.o. good-looking woman, young in heart and body, and I am attempting to resonate with the heart of a the Wholesome Gentleman, Who wants to be in a Committed Relationship. 
Ready to read the text?

""Lots of single seniors stumble through online dating instead of dating smart.""
I'm wondering what is ""smart dating"". . .

Of course, dating a coworker whom one knows for a long time would be the best. I my case it's not possible as I'm a privately working teacher.

""Integrity, emotional intelligence, kindness, and compassion, are a few examples of qualities that might make your list, but there are many others.""

Certainly, there are the others, but those listed above are most important. 

""Physical appearance, wealth, social status, and other surface qualities are not substitutes for the meaningful, inner qualities on your list.""

Physical appearance is strongly connected to the inner insight, and women are no less visual than men, but no one looks for the correctness of features. Everybody Reads a Lot in the Eyes. Mine are big hazel, looking straight and smiling. You can easily read my thoughts in them. Unlike many ladies, I tell what I think and do what I tell. I risk to open up and face the pain of misunderstanding, but I'll never try to hide anything or Use Anybody.

""Love at first sight is a senior, newbie dating fantasy guaranteed to fail whether you're the one doing the sweeping or being swept. Seniors are too experienced to still believe in love at first sight, which only happens in the movies.""

Right, but what about just FEELING who another person is at the 1st sight? Eye expression, language (vocabulary, choice of expressions), the sound of a voice Do Help a lot to know instantly about what can be expected from a person.

""When a senior dater falls in love based on physical attraction that's actually lust at first sight, and suggests desperation"".
Right, desperation or just stupidity.

""Dinner at a romantic restaurant is not a smart first date choice because it doesn't serve either person's purposes.""

Of course, even in the times when everything moves fast, going to the restaurant, usually followed by sharing a bed (am I wrong?) can only witness the total absence of the Seriousness on Intents. It's ONLY for one-night stands.

""If you really want to get to know someone on a first date, which is the purpose of a first date anyway, chat with them over coffee for an hour. You're far more likely to ask the tough questions if you're not floating in a romantic bubble, and a second date will be easier to determine after you asked the important questions. ""

I ma sure it doesn't matter WHERE to ask tough questions.

""Sex on a first or second date isn't a realistic path to fall in love. In fact it will have the exact opposite effect. Sex too soon brings the getting to know you aspect of a relationship to a screeching halt because sex becomes the relationship's focus rather than discovering each other on a deeper level first. And the relationship typically ends a few months later when a couple begins to see each other more clearly.""

So, we are talking about online meetings? Of course, any Normal Person Before Meeting someone should learn much. . . Pretty often the process of learning is hard, frustrating, and people part before an initial meeting. There are so many paths that lead to misunderstanding, that it takes a good effort to appreciate and see the real person behind the words. 

I insist on using SKYPE as it lets people discover a lot instantly.

It's the very beginning though!

I have high standards for a man...I'm a good woman and want a good man. I'm grateful for all I have in my life and for the country in which I was born. Our chemistry includes a mutual sense of humor, lots of mental and physical stimulation - if we can laugh together, we can love together. Deep thinkers who make me laugh are a turn on.

I'm an American-born Latina, self employed, was raised well, and I am very loyal to the man I'm with. I'm told I'm sexy, smart, fun, and sweet. I have awesome kids who are grown, gone, and doing well. I want an old school man with a young spirit, the kind who has manners, who is a warm-hearted man, who has a healthy sex drive, the kind of man who can fix things, he doesn't do yoga, and he likes a good steak. I like the down to earth type who makes me laugh and has my back. Communication is a MUST. I don't like to guess what you're thinking, I try to be pretty clear and honest. I want something LTR, not here to get text pals or play games, I'm into reality and will only date a man where the possibility of falling in love is evident. I work for myself so I have the flexibility to grab my tablet and go, I love my work, but only work to live. I want us both to be a place of refuge for each other, a place of refreshing from the stresses of life.

I'm attracted to hunky white boys with strong morals and big hands.
If we have the chemistry everything will fall into place.

I'm not looking for hit and run sex or an exchange of sex for things. I know CL is a disastrous way to seek love, but I do know people who have met on this site, so I'm giving it a try. I won't respond if you are seeking casual sex so you may as well save your time (and mine). I am looking for a kind, realistic, intelligent man who is looking for the same. I am attractive, get hit on, not desperate, have self respect, expect to be treated well, and treat others well. I'm normally sexually oriented, no power games or weird kinky needs, just intimacy with the right one, libidinous. I am looking for a real connection with longevity, intimacy, friendship, time together and to see how things work out. I enjoy occasional alcohol, not an alcoholic, and don't date alcoholics, or addicts. Don't be married or involved with someone, I am not married or involved with someone, completely single. I am willing to do my part and contribute to make things work out, I enjoy sharing and turn taking socially. Looking for an equal relationship with respect and appreciation, no users.

So I'm looking for a gentleman tutor to have a singles affair. I list you there for a moment didn't I. Hear let me explain. I'm looking for an experienced kinky guy to explore my sexuality with. To try new things, to show me all the tips and tricks that you have to offer and the end result? We end up fucking each others brains out. 

Maybe it's slow and sweet, spending time exploring one another's body. Building up anticipation and need. Till it boils over in an earth shattering climax. (Yes, those exist, you know brain shutting down, body shaking, forgetting to breath, vision going white, full body rush.) Maybe it's hard and fast. The point is I want it all. 

But the affair part is nice too. My ideal situation is we get a nice hotel room. Maybe around here or maybe somewhere else make it a little get away.

Meeting up, hanging out, doing various things. Before heading to our hotel room. I'm looking for sex and I'm also looking for escape. The hotels keep it discreet, I don't have to worry about the particulars, who can host. If your roommate will hear us. Its keeps things simple. Simply you or me. We can be as loud as we want or do it as many times as we want. When we're together we're together, open and honest with one another, and when we're not together we're not. That being said, it doesn't mean we can't be friends. I want to get to know you. Like the real you. 

So a little about me. I'm 30, African American, bbw, with dark hair, skin, and eyes. I'm a really busy girl and when I'm not working family and friends take a lot of my time. I'm long for this to be with one person and a bit of a long term thing, maybe on a biweekly to weekly basis. 

Send me an email we'll chat get to know one another kinks, things we each one to try, dislikes. If we mesh we can see where we go from there.

Hi!
Please read everything before replying, thx. 
Not looking for sex...life is not all about sex... It is mostly about everything else other than sex... Not everybody can or wants to have sex.
Romantic dates don't require it... Example; a romantic dinner with wine and a walk on the beach, a romantic night out at a ballroom concert, a romantic movie... A candle light dinner at home... Etc. 
Therefore, I'm looking for an older man who wants all the fun things that a close loving relationship offers without the requirement of sex. If all you want is sex, try the Casual Encounters section. That's where the trash is.... Not here. 

About me; I am near 60 and unable to work due to aches & pains but I can walk and get around pretty good otherwise. I am hoping to find someone like me. Maybe you are older than me (I hope ). 
Maybe you are retired and live alone. 
Maybe you want someone who needs a little help, someone to spend your days/evenings with, someone to take a short walk with, shop with, see a movie with, go out to eat with. Someone like you!

This paragraph devoted to being upfront. 
It wouldn't matter to you that I don't have a job because I just can't work with this body that is beautiful but painful, or that I had a surgery last year and so now I am a transgendered female (yes I am all female and I have legal notorized proof which says I am to be considered female, a woman, therefore, I am here in w4m). I am told I look good. I know there are alot of you who are good with that because I meet you everyday wherever I go. 

I am kind of quiet & shy. But I don't mind cooking! 

If I sound like someone you would like to talk to and maybe meet, REPLY TO THIS POSTING, and please send a picture so I can also send you one. If not, just move on to the next posting. 

Thanks!

Hello, 

My name is Theresa. 

I'm posting here because I'd like to meet someone, become friends and may be lead to a relationship. To start off I will let you know this post will probably not be too seductive but hopefully someone will feel compatible and respond. I just want to throw out there I'm not desperate, a killer, psycho, a whore, a pile of yuck and looking for a sugar daddy or anything strange and out of the ordinary. 

I'm not sure where to start so I suppose I can start with things I like to do for fun and all . Well i love to hangout with my friends and family, i love to go out and dance on occasion. I absolutely <3 music and pretty much listen to anything except for classical.(i have no idea it just seems to bore me and put me to sleep). I like going on road trips and the last one i went on included going to reno on some weird adventure with a few friends. i also like going to the movies and out to dinners. oh and i also love people watching with friends because its funny to watch drunk people blabber about stupid things. last time i did that i was on bart and i watched a few drunk girls drink vodka and cranberry juice out of a water bottle while trying to hold their balance as the train was moving. i then started making bets with a friend on who i thought was gonna fall.=) 

OK on to the good stuff I suppose. Well physically I'm around 5'6-5'7. I""m not super skinny or really fat. i have some meat one me. I can also assure you that I'm not a pile of yuck once again. I have long jet black hair with some honey blonde balayage. I have brown eyes oh and a tan complexion cuz I'm filipino. geez i have nothing else to say oh yeah i know..... i have arms, legs feet and all the other normal stuff a female body should have. 

Well i don't wanna bore you any longer. So i will tell you what i'm looking for. well honestly i like/ and only date older white guys. (i know it sounds bad but i know what i like). I like for the person to be older than me, be taller than me, have some Intelligence. I don't need a mechanical engineer. But I love being able to have-deep conversations about whatever conceptual garden my random mind is running through at any given moment. oh and for the person to be honest and have a sense of humor. This is the most important of all traits because it will determine if I will get bored of you or not. I don't have much of an attention span at times, and it's your personality/ sense of humor that will keep me interested. I'am a very playful person.

I'm a busy girl, but lately I've found that I want to spend my free time with someone other than my friends. So, I'm looking for a guy that wants to take me out, spend a nice time and a romantic evening with me. Or maybe go to the beach, do something fun. I am not just looking for a hookup and I'm also not looking for fwb. I'm 19, BBW, and white. I am only interested in white and Hispanic guys. Please be 5'10+ and in shape. Those are just my preferences. I like older guys but don't have a maximum or minimum age limit. 

Please send me a picture and some general info to get a reply. You'll get the same back.

Let's have fun inside and outside the bedroom. 
I am not looking for a hook up, just sayin' for all you boys who have Blue Balls Syndrome, and I can't do the full-time thing right now, that's why ""part-time boyfriend"" label. I am open for more if we click. 
I do need a lot of sex and having to hunt all the time is not as fun as it use to be. I want someone I want to see again and again and not just for sex, but because we have fun together and we like each other's company. 

You must be a great kisser, hung, have a nice hairy chest, legs, arms.... Single and between 30-50 and local to SF. Be open-minded, smart, travelled, cultured, passionate, talented with your mouth and ready for fun. Let's explore each other's body, grab a bite, snuggle in front of a movie, cook up some dinner, hang out, go to a show and/or fuck each other silly.

I have met a few cool people here on CL but nothing lasting, seems like a lot of you guys are not really single, just sayin'. I am tired of one-night-stands, I am looking for a real connection with someone smart, fun, cute and hairy. Have your life in order, I am not looking for drama or to be your sugar mommy.

Me: 40, SWF, BBW, cute, easy going, experienced and fun. I have got my shit together, I am educated, I can hold a conversation and I'd rather talk about what to cook next, arts or politics than shoes. I love music and photography. 

Your pic will get you mine. Please send me your stats, a bit about your interests in life to get an answer. 
I am not looking for a pen-pal so please let's not waste our time.

I am a very happy, open and loving soul...I love music so much and part of my research focusses on sound in the city. So there is lots to talk about...

The last of the classybreed, a one man woman, the kind of woman whose arms you look forward to coming home to every night? If so and if you qualify, I'm yours!! 

I am a single black woman seeking likes of the same BUT A MALE. I want a real relationship. I believe a person knows when something is right and you decide to spend time to get to know a person and allow it to develop. Commitment, communication, common courtesy, desire, loyalty, respect, trust, wanting to be with one another and unconditional love is of the utmost importance in any relationship. I want a man companion who is excited and very interested in me just as I will be about. I enjoy making him my number one priority, my number one best friend, giving him my undivided attention, unconditional love and affection. Most of all, having lots and lots of fun and just enjoying together what life has to offer. If I've captured your interests please connect with me. 

Best ~

Ok, now that I have your attention, I'm one playful country gal. I do work, and I have responsibilities to myself. I'm that diamond in the rough. I've been educated, well bred and well read. I love music of many kinds but what keep's me going is country music. I love a good movie but horror is my preference. I think my favorite food is sushi, but I do love my noodles. I do love the ocean, and I try to go there often. I'm good with my hands, yeah, yeah, let the imagination wonder but by that it means, plant's, flowers, sewing, crocheting, knitting, cooking, baking. I'm good at many things and I own a set of tools and a tool box. I love car's, mostly muscle and imports. I'm quick witted and I am good with banter. I'm far from shy, and most would say non assuming but extremely gifted to rise to any challenge and win. I do have a past, but so do you. I'm a good woman, a excellent lover, a devoted mom, and a grandmother and animal lover.

I seek a single, educated, gentleman. Integrity run's high on my list. A man of his word. No, I am not expecting perfection but if he breaks a promise or date an apology and a make up for it goes a long way. A great quality is a man who can hold a conversation. A good soul, someone who won't belittle or make less of. A man who loves his family and will fight for an us and take into consideration my feelings. Someone to grow gracefully old with. Someone to fight with and make up with. Is it you? You have to want a relationship to be with me. Please no self medication, abusive drinker or smoker. I've had enough bad times to last me a lifetime. No hidden agenda's.

I've recently discovered some very interesting new desires. I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for, but I do know that I need a strong Dominant man to guide me. My desire to explore this part of me is taking over my every waking thought. Can you help me.

I'm not a doormat. I'm use to taking care of myself. I have a mind of my own and will ask questions when something doesn't make sense to me or I don't understand.

I'm looking for a Dom/Dominant man who is safe and sane, who can mold me and teach me. Race or age is not an issue.

Please tell me a little about yourself, what you expect and are into. Also please put your favorite color in the subject line so I know this is not a spammer or bot. If there is no color in the subject line I will delete the message.

Please be patient. I will be answering those with a face/body pic, and the ones that responded to ""Please tell me a little about yourself, what you expect and are into"" first.

I'm a catch. You're a catch.
We aren't perfect but we've got those magic ingredients to live a juicy life, and are open and available to share it. I definitely enjoy the journey.

I've hatched out of the time it takes to do the 'work' and get over/move on from a great but not-meant-to-be partnership (a LTR ended over a year ago), so have joyfully hopped back into the dating pool with a clear conscience, open mind, wiser heart and a yearning for anything from a coffee date, to cuddling to deep intimacy. Open to where things go organically with no road map in place. 

I have and have had incredible growthful relationships. Joyful, fun, deepening. I continue to seek a the fun and excitement that dating brings...and when something opens up to something more: awesome. We'll embark on that together.
So if you're really available and curious. And your'e seeking both magic and the fun and comfort in the mundane. I look forward to meeting you.

I don't have a long list of what is necessary, except, yes:

Thanks for reading. My idea of a perfect evening is cuddling on the couch, talking about our days, eating dinner, maybe massage each other and watch a little tv if we don't get involved with something else. I have very little interest in politics or religion.

On weekends, I like to go for a bike ride, work out, go for a day trip, play games, or do a project together. I want a man who can help me buy a used car, find solutions to tricky problems, or just know about me and my life. I like to spend time with my sweetie. 

I have a lot to give. I'm a great listener and very supportive, and I expect the same in a partner. I'm super sensual and love kissing. I work in the psychology field and consider myself a great communicator, very honest, and authentic. 

I think I have a pretty healthy lifestyle. I like to eat well, exercise, have balance. I don't drink or smoke and can't tolerate being around smokers. I can't see myself hanging out with somebody who smokes pot more than occasionally.

I'd love to find somebody to get to know who is enthusiastic, communicative, honest, easy going and has time in their life for a partner. I'm seeking somebody who is loving, smart, verbal, attentive, horny, and funny. I love manly men with a soft side.

I guess I'm on the big side, even BBW category I suppose, but I'm graceful and fit, not doughy. I have long, pretty hair, a great smile, and silky soft, responsive skin. I'm told I'm easy to be around, and I have quality friends who love me. 

If this piques your interest, send me some WORDS!! I am just stunned that people write stuff like ""pic?"" as their entire response (as if that would tempt me!!), or ""u sound kul."" LOL. If you feel me, I'd love to hear from you. Honestly, I won't even respond if you write less than a sentence.

I've been around a few blocks in this online dating world, even a few neighborhoods. I've had my share of dates at cafes, restaurants and on hiking trails. I've felt the anticipation and excitement of taking it offline after engaging exchanges that made it seem like we were simply made for one another. I've felt confused when there's been an obviously mutual online connection with someone who then suddenly disappeared. And I've had the experience, more than once, that what appears to click so well online and on the phone doesn't survive the transition into ""real life."" Have you had any of these experiences?

It's quite a process! Yet here I am, determined to stay open, optimistic and available, and most importantly, to welcome a loving relationship into my life.

With these reflections in mind, I've decided on a change of course. Rather than post a laundry list of who I am and who you're 'supposed' to be, I'm ready for something different. Common interests and values are fundamental -- no doubt about it -- but no matter what's on any of those lists; if that ineffable quality of chemistry isn't present, none of the rest matters. 

What makes that chemistry thing show up is utterly mysterious to me. Physical attraction is only part of it -- it's more of an energetic thing, of this I'm sure. Ohhh, I love the seductive sparks of an instant connection just like anyone, but I'm looking for what endures after the sparks are replaced with something deeper. 

Resonance happens, I think, not with a mouse click, but with the click that comes with presence, with being real and with taking a risk to open to another. Emotional intelligence and plenty of laughter help a lot, too!

If you're interested in and open to an easy meeting with no pressure, and you know how to listen as well as talk and can converse with curiosity, then I'd love to hear from you! Even if those sparks are not ignited between us, we can take a walk or share a beverage or a meal, enjoy one other's company and wish one another well without taking it all too terribly personally. 

I'm ready ... are you?

I've been told that I have a presence. Men take notice when I'm in the room. I am the woman laughing and bringing a smile to everyone around her. People immediately feel at ease with me. I love music, dancing, and the rich aroma of a well-aged tawny port. Feeling the warmth of the sunrays caressing my bare skin brings me pleasure.

I feel cherished when a man:
- opens the door for me
- plans the date
- calls me after a date to see if I made it home safely
- texts me just to say he's thinking of me
- brings me flowers for no reason
- holds my hand

If you can see yourself in the scenario below, I'd love to hear from you. You're the man I'm looking for! Tell me a bit about yourself and why this scenario resonates with you. Note that my man is within five years of my age. Photos are appreciated.

On my birthday, he takes me to dinner at Chez Panisse because he knows that I've never been there for dinner and always wanted to go there. It's a warm summer night and I am wearing my red dress. He is looking handsome as usual in a suit. I have a huge grin on my face as I excitedly look at the menu.

We are sitting at an intimate table in the corner of the restaurant enjoying a glass of tawny port after a delicious meal. The port is golden brown and I can smell the rich aromas waffling from a distance. The restaurant is bustling with happy people. The scents from all of the heavenly dishes around us are mingling in the air.

He has told the waiter that we are celebrating my birthday and has pre-arranged to have the staff bring creme brûlée with a lit candle, singing ""Happy Birthday"" to me. He knows that I love creme brûlée. Everyone in the restaurant joins in and sings with the staff. There is loud clapping afterwards. I haven't felt so adored since my 10th birthday party! He's taking selfies of us and I'm smiling from ear to ear.

After finishing the sweet-smelling vanilla dessert, he presents me with my birthday gift. He has a mischievous grin on his face as I open the carefully wrapped present. The wrapping is purple because he knows that's my favorite color. When I open the box, I find an iPod because he knows that I don't have an iPod for my car. I look at him wide-eyed and thank him for the thoughtful gift with a tender kiss.

He suggests that we listen to the iPod on the way home and that's when I find out that it has all of my favorite songs on it. He knows what songs to add because he knows about my list of favorite songs that I keep on my computer. He is smiling slyly feeling clever than ever. When I realize that the iPod has all of my favorite songs on it, I realize at that moment that the man sitting next to me is my soulmate. This man knows me and aims to please me. I am feeling happier and more content than I have ever felt in my life.

I go out occasionally and have many social activities, but it seems, that, either, I meet people I already know, and most of those people are couples, or I find people to whom I'm not particularly attracted. 

I'm not too surprised that I'm not finding who I'm looking for, as I haven't been looking very hard and sometimes it seems like looking for a needle in a haystack :-) 

In past good relationships, I've usually met my BF doing something I already enjoyed doing; when I wasn't really looking for someone. 
We would meet as friends and eventually grow into lovers. 

The Someone Special I'm seeking is a combination of healthy, smart, upbeat, in his late 50's to 70 years old, enthusiastic about both mental and physical activities, possessed of a witty sense of humor, a sensual kisser, graduate education and who has the emotional framework and free time to welcome getting to know each other. 

He's a SWM, a non-smoker, appreciative of spontaneous absurdity, somehow still unjaded from the trials of love and life, emotionally idealistic enough to seek a meaningful connection with a partner, independent and individualistic enough to keep his own identity, highly portable, perhaps a bit shy but ultimately warm and open, tender-hearted, but still manly, flexible in mind, supple in body, agile in schedule, a lover of words and ideas, explorative as a lover , a true male encouraging feminism, who has a luminous and contagious smiler. 

A ""man like you"" is someone not unlike me!

While it would be great to suddenly meet someone like you and hit it off immediately, I have my doubts about the Internet as a place to do it. That said, it's worth a try. So drop me a line, and let me know who, what, where - your name, age, in which city you live, height and weight, work, passions.

I am sweet, petite, thin, athletic SWF with grad degrees, can be silly and silent sometimes, always warm sometimes witty, size 4, blue-green eyes and dark curls.

Prefer a SWM, 55-70, who lives/works on the Peninsula/South Bay.

I know this is a shot in the dark, but please hear me out. I am looking for a man that can make me feel like the women in romance novels. Someone I can trust, be romantic with and surrender to and not feel guilty for doing so. 

I want a man I can be myself with, enjoy, but s very loving, considerate nurturing, sensual, loves to make love slowly and savor a woman. I want the kind of man that treasures a woman's innocence and loving nature. 

I have, like many people, have chosen the wrong ones and even those that have abused it, but I find myself longing for something that no ordinary man can fill. I know it is a tall order but my very essence longs for a real man's presence. 

I am a woman in a poly relationship, and though I love my partners, they are not on my level in this department. They have not had this experience and I want someone who knows what they are doing. 

I am not looking to change your situation or mine, I'm simply seeking to be fulfilled. I am a professional woman, a mom, I have many I wrests and am very talented in many things. I am a very sensual person and loving. 

I I want someone who talks their time, strong but quiet strength, that listens; someone who knows how to make love to you in a simple touch or look or kiss. You just know. 

I am looking for a Caucasian or Asian man starting in their 50's on up, unless you are that gifted in knowing a woman and you are at least 45. I do not like younger men and you will get no response. Please be able to host, mobile and financially stable. Please be sane, DD free, handle your own drama and know what you want. 

I am an Ebony female, Bbw, well endowed, love music, wine tasting, performances, beaches, the rain, esoteric literature, out of the ordinary box I live in; just spending time in nature and I love RVing. I love slow love making and savoring touch and time. 

Pic for pic. Serious inquiries please.

Want to meet, have an adventure and get to know one another. On Sunday, when you should probably be doing laundry or something, why not try something a little bit new. I'm looking to have some fun, and it could be a shortish date we can eat some dinner grab a glass of wine and chat for an hour or so. And maybe nothing will happen and then again maybe it will. What else are you doing anyway, what is more important that possibly opening your heart to someone. I'm a redhead blue eyes five four one hundred thirty pounds. I'm up for something kind of fun and casual. I'm sure that we can think of something. Looking for a mature guy who can hold up a conversation and wants to get to know someone who is interesting, independent and creative.

Hi,

So I've been single about 8 months now and I really miss having someone special to share things with. Im not looking to jump into a relationship or willing to settle for anyone but it would be nice to meet someone and see where things go. 

About me: Im 25, 5'6"" curvy and mixed race. Im a bit of a workaholic but like to hang with friends, go to the gym and just chill. I like reading on the beach or going hiking and am currently training for Rugged Maniac in May. I also like going to concerts at the Catalyst or Moe's Alley and air hokey on the board walk. Im pretty easy going and a good listener, I take a little while to warm up and get comfortable (or a couple of beers, lol) but when I do Im silly and like to talk about random stuff. 

About you: Around my age, probably not younger than 24 and you have similar interests. And interested in more than just a hook up. Also Im not really interested in playing games and texting forever but never actually meeting. So you should be willing to meet up for coffee or drinks fairly soon. I like to get to know people in person and see if things can work out. 

If your interested email me with a pic, no nudes please and I'll send mine. Thanks

One might think finding a real man wouldn't be so difficult.
But finding an honest, adult male between the ages of 35-55, over 5'9"", with a job, who can host from time to time, likes to go out to movies/dine out/dance/hikes, who is not married/has a gf/claims to be in an open relationship and their partner is fine with them being a cheater...
Finding an honest adult male who is as interested in pleasing his partner as he is with his partner pleasing him, someone whose main concern isn't how little effort it will take him to get the maximum out of a female...
Generally finding an adult male who is willing to treat a partner with the same decency and respect he wants to be treated with is virtually nonexistent.

I do keep hoping to find this man in or near Marin County.

What do women bring to Life aside of the Life they give to the babies? Yes, Devotion and Beauty. They are your Source of Inspiration, They are less tested by increasing hormone level; that's why usually they are better committed partners than men.
Right?
And you know that the level of civilization should be measured by its attitude to a Woman too? 
Good for you!
Then let's talk a little.

I've just turned 63 (Pisces) . Although not a Grandma yet, and I'm a nice looking youthful in mind and body woman, I know that the biggest part of my journey has been already lived. I need to make its final part full of Dignity and Beauty. 
I'm NOT an American ""gal"" (not Asian or Hispanic nor Hispanic). Guess where attractive women are educated, serious and kind... They are also responsible for their country. Yes, I'm a citizen of yours now...
I'm tired of being a plane with one wing but ready to stay alone till death if my Dignified Knight doesn't appear before. 

I've got education ( multiple degrees), built my career, raised the children and made a certain number of mistakes which I would like to avoid repeating.

It seems to me that what an Intelligent, Decent and Honest woman, looking for a partner for a final chapter of her life, needs to think of is how this man relates to her in terms of :

1)her views and beliefs ( I have a high spirit, believe in education, am opposite to feminists but can't be told what to do by anybody. I greet the wind in the face!), her attitude to politics (I'm active and passionate about what I believe in. In short, I'm an activist), the work she does ( I'm going to never retire as I love my profession and can always work part time, while having an opportunity to choose when and how much to work, and this is my way of expressing myself in life);
2) how compatible their characters are. (I'm peaceful, friendly, dignified, not materialistic and not diplomatic-just desperately sincere and unable to stand insincere, indecisive and fearful beings.) I can't be ""controlled"" by the man as I'm absolutely committed by nature. I will ask for advice myself but won't stand constant ""corrections"". To put it in a nutshell, I'm Not a Follower and Not a Leader. I can only walk by the side of my equal. An ""alpha male"" isn't my match for sure.
3) if they are compatible sexually. By this age, too many men have lost their potency while women, after having given all they should to the children and families, are still up to experiencing the richness of love life with the Men they Can Respect.

Right, it's Very Hard to Meet Such Men on Dating Sites. 

We love with our soul and body, don't we? I'm passionate and intense if in love (You know that Love Is Demanding, right?), and I want to be on fire and to have a chance to TRUST every step my partner makes. I'm a devoted and reliable friend, and I need to feel the reciprocation of the same level; otherwise, my feminine pride will push me to leaving. 

Yes, your Celebrating the Existence of Women is Welcome:-)

Accomplished, successful, very attractive Black female seeking a male for a serious, long-term, female-led relationship. For clarification, this is not for sexual fetishists or to fulfill someone's fantasy. Although I am a novice to this type of relationship, after much research and review, I have determined that it is the best fit for me. It represents the type of lifestyle that I would like to live with a like-minded individual. That is, I desire a man who receives his pleasure from providing me with love, romance, emotional support and also seeks the level of intimacy and connection that I seek. Basically, he is my best friend and is devoted to me. He is receptive to my leadership and guidance, aware that although he may have input into our decision-making process, the final decision rests with me. Although I expect that we will have a happy and healthy sex life, I would like my partner to be receptive to the POSSIBILITY of cuckolding. Types of punishment for my partner will be determined jointly as will rewards for his loyalty in ensuring my overall happiness and contentment. I have no interest in BDSM types of punishment(i.e: caning, whipping, slapping, etc.) nor will I dehumanize or demoralize my partner. Ultimately, together we will develop a relationship that works the best for us. Other characteristics that I desire in my partner is that he be between the ages of 37-55, intelligent, educated, successful in his own right and financially stable. He must have an Alpha presentation in the ""outside"" world but be submissive to me in the home. I am also a sapiosexual-I am sexually stimulated by intellect. I believe in full-disclosure; therefore, it is important that any interested parties be aware that I have had HSV Type 2 for 15 years. Because I have behaved responsibly, I have infected no one. I am receptive to any questions or concerns you may have regarding my status.

For those of you who may find this type of relationship and/or my status objectionable or offensive, I ask that you refrain from sending me vulgar and disgusting responses. Simply don't respond.

To the individual who has determined that my post required flagging, despite the multitude of dick pics and putrid requests notorious for this website, I urge you to find another outlet for your frustration.

Hi- 

I'd like to find an upbeat, positive, active male, with old fashioned manners, that enjoys going out dancing, walking, wine tasting, museums, and more.I love going out dancing, I am an not a great dancer, but I like it anyway, specially salsa and club dancing. 

I am a busy single mom- two busy teenagers. They have their studies, activities, sports, and social life, which gives me time for a significant other. 

I am 5'8'' 128 lb with long blond hair, highly educated and gainfully employed. I like to go to the gym, hiking, dancing, theater. 

I am not interested in one night stands, only in a friendship that has the potential to grow into a loving partnership. I would like to find a professional, educated man, 45 to 60, at least 5'10'' who is local, emotionally available and has the desire to have a best friend and lover.

Are you a young man looking for your older woman? Do you find the conversation much more interesting with us than it is with the young twenty-something's your age?

I don't know if i can find anyone on this service. I can only describe what i am like and what i am looking for, then hope for the best.


I am pretty special and people always remember my face, even if i don't remember theirs.
It's hard to describe why, but i am racially mixed, like to wear artful clothing and jewelry, 
have long hair (it's still dark but for 2 white hairs). 

People say i am pretty, and look a little younger than my age. I am on the feminine side.

Also, i am really fun, make you laugh a lot (i am trying my hand at stand up comEdy so you can be my audience, OK?), lovable, intelligent, educated


What i am looking for is love, trust, a relationship and friendship, hopefully, if that can be found here. Sadly, this site is so full of pornography that people seem to think that that is all it's about,and just send pictures of their genitals. Hey, don't send that to me. I am never going to answer you if you do. 

I want a genuine, loving, creative, local guy (within the bay area, not off in Fresno or Modesto or something like that....no good to make lots of global warming) who wants to have a real friend and hopefully real love. If you want to start really slowly and carefully that is good for me.


I am in very early 50s, and seek someone around 44--55 (not much out of this range please).
You must be non-smoker, no drugs or other vices (being a workaholic is a vice to me. I want someone with time to be together and have fun).

My preference is medium dark to dark skin, dark hair, not too tall and not fat.

Sorry, i don't go for blonds or really light skin and eyes. 

I am on the small side and have some leftover pounds from being a mama, but it is disappearing with all the dance classes i go to. I like the gym as well and we can go together if you like. 

You still have your hair, or most of it, NOT bald or shaved head please (yes, i have mine, and it's long, and growing). Some white hair is OK.

I have a big preference for guys who love humor, smile, treat me really well, have a good relationship with their families and don't shy away from commitment.

I don't like TV. If you really like it and watch it a lot this won't work out.
I don't even have one. I am too busy, for one, but besides that, i can't stand commercials, and frankly, i don't like to sit and watch it. To me that is just wasting life itself.

I want someone who loves to dance (my likes are cumbia, samba, Mexican music, Reggae and reggaeton are OK sZydeco at Ashkenaz is fun, La Peña sometimes has good shows, then there are places in San Jose as well) o we can enjoy that together.

KPFA 94.1 FM is on a lot at my place, and i participate in a lot of the marches and demonstrations announced there, so i want a progressive like myself, into progressive movements like Black Lives Matter (Brown Lives too), Living Wage, Stop Gentrification, Immigration Reform, and the like. 

A lot of my time goes to dance classes. I do have time on weekends and love to be together then. I love to go to street fairs, programs at Ashkenaz or La Pen~a or Mission Cultural Center, throw parties or dinners, weave (yes, i do this) and do other art-y things, try new places and things. 

I like to take photos and am trying to learn to make good video.
If you have similar interests maybe we should meet up. Please tell me about yourself and what your interests are, what you do for a living, where you live, if you have kids, etc. Please write enough so i will know if this is worth pursuing.

If you are vegetarian that is cool. I am not but don't eat any red meat, and usually avoid dairy too...but i don't eat red meat because It is not too healthy and it is not sustainable for our planet. .
I am single mom (only one kid, now a teenager) and the two of us live alone together. It would be nice to find a person that eventually will be my partner, so we can live together. I live Bay Area, not too far from San Francisco (i know, it is expensive). I am not too into the suburbs.

Please make sure you really want a friend/partner before you respond. I am pretty tired of these people who disappear after 3 or 5 emails or calls before we even meet. It makes me think they are married (if you are, or if you have a girlfriend or anything similar please DO NOT respond! Single guys only).

You have to be into long, deep conversations, good at listening and talking, value upfront verbal communication and being straightforward. I am very straightforward, and don't like silence or non verbal gestures that don't speak outright. We are not mind readers and should not have to be.

I speak Spanish as a native, use it at work and in life. 

Hey, progressives only! VOTE! I am voting Bernie Sanders and YES on legalize pot in CA.
I am volunteering with this campaign. I like political minded people and activists, not complainers or couch potatoes.

Please don't write to say ""Your ad is too long. I just lost my hard-on."" (LOL).
Dude, if you don't like to read, you are NOT the one i'm looking for! And i'm not looking for a romp in sack anyway! True love or Bust! Romp in the sack only if you are my boyfriend, period.

Looking for some lighthearted, witty banter over the phone. Get to know each other a little, flirt, and if it feels comfortable, maybe more.

I'm intelligent, sexy, educated, and cosmopolitan. Successful and confident in most areas of my life, but also reserved. Never done this, actually. I've always had but repressed a desire to be submissive to the right guy. Nothing too intense - a subtle play of power in the subtext of our conversation... a game that you ultimately win.

You're intelligent, funny, charismatic, mature, a leader in some way, with a sexy voice, 40s-50s, and ideally dominant - but in a quietly confident way. Machismo and bragging are not sexy; intelligence, humor, and confidence are sexy. I want a man who inspires my trust, who's worthy of my respect, who can quiet my fears and make me want to share my desires with him. 

In your response, show me what makes you special - your intelligence or leadership or humor, or all of the above. Be charming and bold and authentic. And if you can make me laugh out loud in your first email, you're more than halfway to my picture and phone number.

Me: (Only going by what I have been told, btw) Cute, sexy, fun, warm, caring, loving, always smiling. I can be a bit shy but that special someone can easily break me out of that! latina, early 40's

Well this is new....i have never posted on CL before but after trying the bar scene and even using dating websites, I thought...what the hell!

Simply put, I'm looking for someone who has their shit together! someone who knows who they are, knows what they like, what they don't like, and who is in the mind set to be in a relationship. Sense of humor is everything in my book, if you can make me smile or laugh the better! Someone who loves sports is a plus because trust and believe I will ditch you to watch a baseball or basketball game. 

A little about me, I'm quick-witted, sarcastic, a bit of a tomboy (but i can clean up when needed), and spontaneous. Don't expect a supermodel, there's a bit more to love with in body type but It doesn't stop me from hiking, going to the gym, or eating healthy. I'm as laid back as they come and probably one of the most non judgmental people that I know. I love my career and I have invested a lot of time and energy into my education to be where I am now.

Why am I on CL?! Good question!! I'm posting because I have a wonderful life and would like to meet a great guy to share experiences and adventures with me.

Who am I? That's also a good question, and is hard to summarize in a few sentences, but I'll do my best. I'm a 44 year old SWF who lives and works in the East Bay. I'm well-educated (Go Bears!), wicked smart, independent, honest, caring, loyal, and funny. I'm from a traditional East Coast Italian family. I'm active, athletic, and live a very clean lifestyle. I have dark hair and eyes, olive skin, and am thick and curvy (not skinny, but not plus-sized). My two young border collies keep me on my toes! I like doing many outdoor activities especially hiking, paddling, and playing softball. When inside, I watch way too much television and listen to a wide variety of music. I also like going to museums, movies, parks, concerts, sporting events, fairs, trips up and down the coast, etc. 

What am I looking for in a guy? If you think you'd make a great match for me and are interested in responding, please:
- reread my posting to make sure you are someone who can offer a ""total package"" similar to mine and who shares similar interests, etc. 
- be 40ish, tall, single, drama-free, and Caucasian or Hispanic (these are just my preferences) 
- provide a response that's informative and thoughtful, telling me about yourself and why you think we'd click (one liners and canned responses will be automatically deleted)
- put your favorite song in the subject line like I did (so I know you are real and have read my whole posting)

sometimes a house with one person feels cold. Maybe you are reading these ads on this dreary afternoon and thinking there has to be a better way, nonetheless hoping to get some glimmer of a similar person on earth with whom you might resonate. Or maybe you are thinking this afternoon would be vastly improved with a good game of Scrabble or a walk in the rain. Or...If you have been accused of being ""too sensitive,"" you are the man for me. If you have an intimate relationship with your devices, we are not a match. Soup cooking on the stove, ""Quixotic"" on a triple word, I am throwing this out to the universe, and that's a necessity too -- an openness to a spiritual way of thinking -- and hoping that just the right man, with a huge sense of humor and a very big heart, will recognize our similar natures and respond.

Hello,

Today I was reminded how time is precious and how it slips away in a blink of an eye. So here I am in search of someone to spend some time with and someone with whom I want to make some memories.

I am 41 and looking for someone similar in age. At 41, I am not looking to have kids, I do like them, so if you have them, great! I am not helpless chick who needs a man in her life to take care of her. Rather I want to find someone who is loyal, fun and someone who I actually want in my bed. Surprisingly hard to find. 

So if a few things interest you in the below list, tell me about yourself and we will go from there. 

Swimming in the bay, biking in Marin, wine tasting in Sonoma, strolling the farmers market,
Chilling on the couch, hiking Mt Tam, Cooking at home, savoring sake, dining in the city, traveling the world, enjoying the rain while watching a movie. I think you get the picture

Someone has shared this short instruction for single seniors, and I'm posting it in here with my comments and my own ideas.
Yes, I'm a Single 63 y.o. good-looking woman, young in heart and body, and I am attempting to resonate with the heart of a the Wholesome Gentleman, Who wants to be in a Committed Relationship.
Ready to read the text?

""Lots of single seniors stumble through online dating instead of dating smart.""

I'm wondering what is ""smart dating"". . .

Of course, dating a coworker whom one knows for a long time would be the best. I my case it's not possible as I'm a privately working teacher.

""Integrity, emotional intelligence, kindness, and compassion, are a few examples of qualities that might make your list, but there are many others.""

Certainly, there are the others, but those listed above are most important. 

""Physical appearance, wealth, social status, and other surface qualities are not substitutes for the meaningful, inner qualities on your list.""

Physical appearance is strongly connected to the inner beauty or ugliness, and women are no less visual than men, but no one looks for the correctness of features. Everybody Reads a Lot in the Eyes. Mine are big hazel, looking straight and smiling. You can easily read my thoughts in them. Unlike many ladies, I tell what I think and do what I tell. I risk to open up and face the pain of misunderstanding, but I'll never try to hide anything or Use Anybody.

""Love at first sight is a senior, newbie dating fantasy guaranteed to fail whether you're the one doing the sweeping or being swept. Seniors are too experienced to still believe in love at first sight, which only happens in the movies.""

Right, but what about just FEELING who another person is at the 1st sight? Eye expression, language (vocabulary, choice of expressions), the sound of a voice Do Help a lot to know instantly about what can be expected from a person. But then, definitely, it's safer to check if the impressions one got online resonate with those from initial meeting impressions. It is a must to TEST a stranger before opening up. Otherwise, the pain and disappointment are unavoidable. 

""When a senior dater falls in love based on physical attraction that's actually lust at first sight, and suggests desperation"".

Right, desperation or lack of seriousness. Or those unsophisticated seniors consciously limit their expectations to the psychical area. They just don't look for a relationship. 

""Dinner at a romantic restaurant is not a smart first date choice because it doesn't serve either person's purposes.""

Of course, even in the times of High Tech, when everything in life moves so fast, a trip to the restaurant, usually followed by sharing a bed (am I wrong?), can only witness the total absence of the Seriousness of Intents and lack of expectations. It's ONLY for one-night stands.




""If you really want to get to know someone on a first date, which is the purpose of a first date anyway, chat with them over coffee for an hour. You're far more likely to ask the tough questions if you're not floating in a romantic bubble, and a second date will be easier to determine after you asked the important questions. ""





I am sure it doesn't matter WHERE to ask tough questions. But it's much better to invite a person to join a hiking group and see how that person acts being among people. 

""Sex on a first or second date isn't a realistic path to fall in love. In fact it will have the exact opposite effect. Sex too soon brings the getting to know you aspect of a relationship to a screeching halt because sex becomes the relationship's focus rather than discovering each other on a deeper level first. And the relationship typically ends a few months later when a couple begins to see each other more clearly.""





So, we are talking about online meetings? Of course, any Normal Person Before Meeting someone should learn much. . . Pretty often the process of learning ONLINE is hard, frustrating, and people part before an initial meeting. There are so many paths that lead to misunderstanding, that it takes a good effort to appreciate and see the real person behind the words. 
Someone, who's read this post, said that a word ""sex"" had made him read and re-read the post. It's pretty funny, don't you think? People LOVE with their heart and body, but exactly this word, which doesn't always refers to LOVE makes men... read:-)

As a woman, I can tell that this is a Very Complex area. It's strongly recommended to WOMEN to check and check the man, to delay the moment of physical closeness until the level of his real attraction becomes clear.
Women are intuitive, and they are BRAVER than men when they choose a partner. They may know instantly what is going to happen. But a woman needs to exercise cautiousness not to be hurt, as a man can instinctively run away from any commitment. This road is so slippery and full of dangers ...

Sometimes several sentences dropped by a stranger online may be the discovery, the answer, which one couldn't have found for years.

While I've been trying to instruct men about INTIMACY, which is Trust, some man has put it this way:
""Men have to accept that intimacy just because they want to have sex. Women want to have Intimacy; that's why they have sex"".
This truth has just killed me totally.
In response I couldn't say anything but this:
I think that most men in their late 50s and 60s have no potency and no idea about what they need a woman for since the intimacy has been a burden for them for many years. 
Yes, it's Very Sad, Very!

On the other hand, sometimes different strangers ""warn"" women ( including me) that they want "" to have sex several times a week""...
I am sure that a normal woman would not mind being Close to her Beloved man, whom she Trusts, even Several Times a Day:-) but it seems to me that it is Not possible Not because of women... 

I personally do cherish an idea of closeness but have not found my equal- HONEST, Intelligent, Educated, Delicate, Strong and Kind man in 58-68 age range, whose all body parts can participate in Loving Deeply!

What do women bring to Life aside of the Life they give to the babies? 

Yes, Devotion and Beauty. They are your Source of Inspiration, They are less tested by increasing hormone level; that's why usually they are better committed partners than men.
Right?
And you know that the level of civilization should be measured by its attitude to a Woman too? 
Good for you!
Then let's talk a little.

I've just turned 63 (Pisces) . Although not a Grandma yet but nice looking, youthful in mind and body woman, I know that the biggest part of my journey has been already lived up. I need to make its final part full of Dignity and Beauty. 
I'm NOT an American ""gal"" (not Asian nor Hispanic). Guess where attractive women are educated, serious and kind... They are also responsible for their country. But I'm a US citizen...

I'm tired of being a plane with one wing but ready to stay alone till death if my Dignified Man doesn't appear before. 

I've got education ( multiple degrees), built my career, raised the children and made a certain number of mistakes, which I would like to avoid repeating.

It seems to me that what an Intelligent, Decent and Honest woman, looking for a partner for a final chapter of her life, needs to think of is how this man relates to her in terms of :

1) her views and beliefs ( I have a high spirit, believe in education, am opposite to feminists but can't be told what to do by anybody. I greet the wind in the face!), 2) her attitude to politics (I'm active and passionate about what I believe in. In short, I'm an activist), 3) the work she does ( I'm going to never retire as I love my teaching profession and can always work part time, while having an opportunity to choose when and how much to work, and this is my way of expressing myself in life);
4) how compatible their characters are. (I'm peaceful, friendly, dignified, not materialistic and not diplomatic-just desperately sincere and unable to stand insincere, indecisive and fearful beings.) I can't be ""controlled"" by the man as I'm absolutely committed by nature. I will ask for advice myself but won't stand constant ""corrections"". To put it in a nutshell, I'm Not a Follower and Not a Leader. I can only walk by the side of my equal. An ""alpha male"" isn't my match for sure.
5) if they are compatible sexually. By this age, too many men have lost their potency while women, after having given all they should to the children and families, are still up to experiencing the richness of love life with the Men they Can Respect and Love.

Right, it's Very Hard to Meet Such Men on Dating Sites. 

We love with our soul and body, don't we? I'm passionate and intense if in love (You know that Love Is Demanding, right?), and I want to be on fire and to have a chance to TRUST every step my partner makes. As a devoted and reliable friend, and I need to feel the reciprocation of the same level; otherwise, my feminine pride will push me to leaving. 

Yes, your Celebrating the Existence of Women is Welcome:-)

There's nothing better than spending time together with a man that's smart, creative, and a bit sexy. And one who enjoys going to farmer's market for fresh produce!

I'm 5'3, - and in shape, as I enjoy working out. I'm stable, sane, employed, and have my own home. I enjoy cultural outings, outdoor activities, and the genuine companionship of someone in a similar life situation whose interests match my own. I'm well read, politically astute, and enjoy a great conversation.

Now for the harder stuff: I'm looking to expand my social life and possibly meet someone special. A friend first that evolves and grows into something more. I think the best couples are friends as well as lovers.

I'm looking for a SWM professional (white collar) guy who is grounded, reliable, and introspective. Someone who is comfortable enough in his own skin to see the humor in life's ups and downs and can laugh at himself. Someone close to my age who lives nearby. I live in Concord (boring, I know!!)

I like to spend time hanging out in the City catching some lunch or checking out an art gallery and then a hike and out for drinks. Maybe swimming out here in the east bay, being lazy in the sun for a bit, and then going to a movie. Or maybe you teach me something totally out of my comfort zone.

I like fast cars and guys who enjoy speed. Not much beats taking a drive with the top down and the music up loud. I like going out dancing and there is something so sensual as being in the arms of a man on the dance floor.

I like people who enjoy taking a risk and going to new places and trying new items on the menu. You never know until you give it a try!

I also enjoy that connection to spirituality, whatever that means for each of us. I believe there is a greater power out there and that gives me a lot of satisfaction and peace. I'm a beginner when it comes to meditation but spending some quiet time going inward helps me deal with life's challenges.

I'm attracted to a confident man - one who is driven by the need to succeed - but who also has another side to him. A funny, silly side. And understands the work/life balance. And, who when teased, can laugh at himself a bit.

Someone, who supposes he REALLY knows much about life, has shared this short instruction for single seniors, which and I'm posting it in here with my comments and my own ideas.
Yes, I'm a Single 63 y.o. good-looking woman, young in heart and body, and I am attempting to resonate with the heart of a the Wholesome Gentleman, Who wants to be in a Committed Relationship.
Ready to read the text?

""Lots of single seniors stumble through online dating instead of dating smart.""

I'm wondering what is ""smart dating"". . .

Of course, dating a coworker whom one knows for a long time would be the best. I my case it's not possible as I'm a privately working teacher.

""Integrity, emotional intelligence, kindness, and compassion, are a few examples of qualities that might make your list, but there are many others.""

Certainly, there are the others, but those listed above are most important. 

""Physical appearance, wealth, social status, and other surface qualities are not substitutes for the meaningful, inner qualities on your list.""

Physical appearance is strongly connected to the inner beauty or ugliness, and women are no less visual than men, but no one looks for the correctness of features. Everybody Reads a Lot in the Eyes. Mine are big hazel, looking straight and smiling. You can easily read my thoughts in them. Unlike many ladies, I tell what I think and do what I tell. I risk to open up and face the pain of misunderstanding, but I'll never try to hide anything or Use Anybody.

""Love at first sight is a senior, newbie dating fantasy guaranteed to fail whether you're the one doing the sweeping or being swept. Seniors are too experienced to still believe in love at first sight, which only happens in the movies.""

Right, but what about just FEELING who another person is at the 1st sight? Eye expression, language (vocabulary, choice of expressions), the sound of a voice Do Help a lot to know instantly about what can be expected from a person. But then, definitely, it's safer to check if the impressions one got online resonate with those from initial meeting impressions. It is a must to TEST a stranger before opening up. Otherwise, the pain and disappointment are unavoidable. 

""When a senior dater falls in love based on physical attraction that's actually lust at first sight, and suggests desperation"".

Right, desperation or lack of seriousness. Or those unsophisticated seniors consciously limit their expectations to the psychical area. They just don't look for a relationship. 

""Dinner at a romantic restaurant is not a smart first date choice because it doesn't serve either person's purposes.""

Of course, even in the times of High Tech, when everything in life moves so fast, a trip to the restaurant, usually followed by sharing a bed (am I wrong?), can only witness the total absence of the Seriousness of Intents and lack of expectations. It's ONLY for one-night stands.

""If you really want to get to know someone on a first date, which is the purpose of a first date anyway, chat with them over coffee for an hour. You're far more likely to ask the tough questions if you're not floating in a romantic bubble, and a second date will be easier to determine after you asked the important questions. ""

I am sure it doesn't matter WHERE to ask tough questions. But it's much better to invite a person to join a hiking group and see how that person acts being among people. 

""Sex on a first or second date isn't a realistic path to fall in love. In fact it will have the exact opposite effect. Sex too soon brings the getting to know you aspect of a relationship to a screeching halt because sex becomes the relationship's focus rather than discovering each other on a deeper level first. And the relationship typically ends a few months later when a couple begins to see each other more clearly.""

So, we are talking about online meetings? Of course, any Normal Person Before Meeting someone should learn much. . . Pretty often the process of learning ONLINE is hard, frustrating, and people part before an initial meeting. There are so many paths that lead to misunderstanding, that it takes a good effort to appreciate and see the real person behind the words. 
Someone, who's read this post, said that a word ""sex"" had made him read and re-read the post. It's pretty funny, don't you think? People LOVE with their heart and body, but exactly this word, which doesn't always refers to LOVE makes men... read:-)

As a woman, I can tell that this is a Very Complex area. It's strongly recommended to WOMEN to check and check the man, to delay the moment of physical closeness until the level of his real attraction becomes clear.
Women are intuitive, and they are BRAVER than men when they choose a partner. They may know instantly what is going to happen. But a woman needs to exercise cautiousness not to be hurt, as a man can instinctively run away from any commitment. This road is so slippery and full of dangers ...

Last two got flagged.... LOL so i reworded some of it in case I offended CL personally.

Looking for companionship mostly.... Not sure about the monogamy thing... not sure its possible and if so for how long. People get together with intent to stay together forever and ever... in some cases by chance that may be possible.... but i think relationships change as do the people ... and as they evolve individually so might the relationship. SOOO... i just wanna see where things go with no expectations or limitations. 

Anyway. Im a tall bbw with green eyes and lots of tattoos and counting. 46 and have a career. I really dont know what else to say... to bring in my prince charming. These things take time ... not just fall in love from an ad or on a first date or a hook up.... 

Tell me about you... perhaps we can have coffee and go from there. Be avail to text if I give you my number ... it would be nice to have yours.

Dont wanna hear from guys that are named Big Long Shlong or Well Hung.... I dont care about any of the stuff as much as I do other things since all that is available alllll day anyday .... im thinking of more of the TIME and SUBSTANCE that is put into it all. ya know.

Two major requirement: Be taller than me. I am 5' 8"" and around my age ... and live locally. If you live locally... it makes it easier to do stuff after work like movies of coffee or dinner or just hang out. I am not really a phone person but its easier to build a relationship in person.

I am seeking a man who ultimately desires and is capable of lifelong companionship (and in the long-run, marriage), but who can be content starting off slowly. I'm looking for my true mate. Not interested in casual dating with multiple people. I know that it takes some time to really know if we are in love, much less compatible for the long haul.. but if you are not wanting ltr as your main goal in dating, I'm probably not the one for you. My ideal partner will be someone who loves time together and apart, who is educated, curious about life, playful, enjoys the magic in small moments, patient with my busy schedule as I'm finishing up a degree and being a mom, who can appreciate my liberal social-justice oriented values if not share them, but non-radical and non-dogmatic please! 

Since being in school and being a mom, I have spent a lot of time at home. But I love to travel, take walks, dance (though I'm not great at it) and look forward to those things when I get more time. Spiritual awareness as a priority is important to me. I'm looking for someone who is living a life of meaning and purpose, and who is financially secure. A health field would be a good match. Of utmost priority is peaceful respectful relations in relationship. If you are prone to get in arguments, have a history of anger or resentment, blame your exes for your past relationship problems, are critical, etc, we aren't a good match. My reason for being in intimate relationship is to love and accept, and enjoy the warmth and security of your love and acceptance. Other relationships in life are for other kinds of relating.. intimate relationships are for gentleness, exploration, caring, love, collaboration, and acceptance. Everyone needs a resting place, a sanctuary to come home to. May we find that in our relationship. 

If you love animals, kids, and eventually want to live somewhere beautiful, warm, with lots of nature all around, that'd be wonderful. A note: I want you for your heart and soul, and I will love your body because it is yours and I respect and love you. That's what I'd like to find in a mate. My body size and shape currently reflects my years as a very busy mom and student, as I work all day and rarely leave the house at night due to my child being with me. I look forward to when I have time to get back into good self-care and healing in that regard. But if you are looking for an un-fluffy tummy and lithe thighs etc, that's not me at this point. And, I don't want to be with someone who wants a woman for his arm.. I want to be with someone who wants a woman for his spirit. I'm not obese, but I've got some extra pounds at the moment (though I am eager to get out and reclaim my active lifestyle.) Good time to get used to it anyway, as old age will hopefully be something we experience together. :) I'm not into fetishes or one night stands etc. 

Also I want to learn a few indigenous languages.. care to learn one with me? I'd love to have a practice partner.

Today is my birthday, and I'm very grateful to be starting a new year, because the last one was rather tough. Among other things I had a major breakup about six months ago. Since then I've been taking care of myself and therefore haven't had much fun of the man variety.

All of my fun birthday treats revolve around lady oriented stuff. I have some very sweet friends, and I'm lucky to be a grown woman who gets gifts and lovely treatment on my birthday. 

The thing that's missing in my life is interaction with men who are into women. Since men now outnumber women here, this seems ridiculous.

I'm brainy but fun, feminine yet low maintenance, old enough to know myself well and still girlish. I really love men, but it's such a complicated thing dating in San Francisco these days.

I do need to find a man physically attractive and feel a connection with him. Men seem to gloss over these details. But these are essential ingredients, along with timing, location, and mutual respect at all times.

If you are roughly 30-45 years of age, single, generally considered attractive, living in San Francisco or extremely close by, able to have women over to your place, and truly enjoy extra curvy full-figured fat BBW type women, please write to me.

Tell me your age, location, height, relationship status and living situation. And attach a recent clothed photo. These are mandatory non-negotiable requirements to hear back from me.

Compassion and foresight as time eludes us is an important essence. Some are afraid, timid, and set in their ways. I seek a gentleman, a good soul and a real man. Honesty, integrity, and a sense of purpose. No, I'm not into FWB or a 3way, or casual encounter and certainly not a married man. I seek the last love of my life. I crave a mate to be one with. Conversation, communication, laughter and banter is a must. 

Latina, well educated and well bred. I'm a sweetheart and independent with a job. I have many interest in life. I have a sense of adventure but I don't share my man. I have many talents, such as cooking, baking, photography and a few others that would be disclosed later. My compassion is great, and my insight is just as good. Raised military style and have plenty of discipline. I am a mother, a sister, a great friend, an animal lover. I have a great sense of style and do love the simple things of life. I'm an outdoors gal. I clean up and impress as well. I adapt well and have an open mind. I do have a sense of style but do enjoy my jean's and t'shirts. I'm a country gal but enjoy many different venue's.

I'm not into drugs, and I'm not a cheater nor do I carry baggage. I can't be around smoker's and heavy drinkers. If you are piqued and anything resonates with you, by all mean's reply with ""My favorite question is"". Thanks for reading my post and good luck to you all.

I'm tired of spending Saturday nights with my cat, would much prefer a snuggling up with my main sqeeze. I'm looking for a gentleman who has similar values, Some of my values include compassion, integrity,honesty, humility, liberal values and of course a silly sense of humor to match my own. I realize this is a tall order but these are traits I believe I possess. I am semi-disabled so compassion is a needed characteristic in a partner. I'm looking for a true healthy relationship, guys looking for sex only need not apply. I enjoy most things others do, esp the ocean. I can not participate in sports, but do have a sensual side, that comes out when I'm with the right connection. I am also a sober person, so sobriety in a partner is a plus, but not a deal breaker.

What do women bring to Life aside of the Life they give to the babies? Yes, Devotion and Beauty. They are your Source of Inspiration, They are less tested by increasing hormone level than men; that's why usually they are better committed partners.
Right?

And you know that the level of civilization should be measured by its attitude to a Woman too? 
Hopefully, you won't think that I'm ""too complicated and challenging."" 

Then let's talk a little. But I'm complex and intelligent indeed:-)

I'm 63.... Although not a Grandma yet, and a nice looking youthful in mind and body woman, I know that the biggest part of my journey has been already lived up. I need to make its final part full of Dignity and Beauty. 

I'm NOT an American ""gal"", not Asian or Hispanic. Guess where attractive women are feminine, educated, strong and kind and CARING... They are also responsible for their country. Yes, I'm a citizen of yours now, but Ukraine is in my heart, especially now, when there is a hybrid war...

I'm tired of being a plane with one wing but ready to stay alone till death if my Dignified man doesn't appear before. 

I've got education (multiple degrees), built my career, raised the children and made a certain number of mistakes which I would like to avoid repeating.

It seems to me that what an Intelligent, Decent and Honest woman, looking for a partner for a final chapter of her life, needs to think of is how this man relates to her in terms of :

1) her views and beliefs ( I have a high spirit, believe in education, am opposite to feminists but can't be told what to do by anybody. I greet the wind in the face!), her attitude to politics (I'm active and passionate about what I believe in. In short, I'm an activist), the work she does ( I'm going to never retire as I love my profession and can always work part time, while having an opportunity to choose when and how much to work, and this is my way of expressing myself in life);

2) how compatible their characters are. (I'm peaceful, friendly, dignified, not materialistic and not diplomatic-just desperately sincere and unable to stand insincere, indecisive and fearful beings.) I can't be ""controlled"" by the man as I'm absolutely committed by nature. I will ask for advice myself but won't stand constant ""corrections"". To put it in a nutshell, I'm Not a Follower and Not a Leader. I can only walk by the side of my equal. An ""alpha male"" has nothing to do by my side.

3) if they are compatible sexually. By this age, too many men have lost their potency while women, after having given all they should to the children and families, are still up to experiencing the richness of love life with the Men they Can Respect.

Right, it's Very Hard to Meet Such Men on Dating Sites. 

We love with our soul and body, don't we? I'm passionate and intense if in love (You know that Love Is Demanding, right?), and I want to be on fire and to have a chance to TRUST every step my partner makes. I'm a devoted and reliable friend, and I need to feel the reciprocation of the same level; otherwise, my feminine pride will push me to leaving. 

It's also important that a man doesn't try to load a new partner with his baggage. Even a widowed man has to be delicate to the degree where a woman feels his PRESENCE in a moment, not in his past. Those who passed away are beloved forever as people only want to have good memories. Still, a new relationship is extremely fragile, and it can bring too much pain to the woman, who's decided to ... compete with the man's memories...

There may be better ways to find what I am looking for and I still hope this ad will work. I guess here is where I say a little about myself. 
This seems like a very long time ago. We've married for ten years and now been widowed for ten. 
I am looking for a new man and a best friend. Looks are not important, However health is a high priority. If you smoke, do drugs or other unhealthy behavior, don't respond.
I am adventurous, like to travel and try out new things. Especially exciting are new places. For example, I love to discover National Parks and care little about crowded tourist attractions. However, even when we are travelling I hope you like to be comfortable. It's not important to find the most expensive places but cleanliness is crucial. 

It would be fantastic If you are around my age (or a little younger) who likes to travel, entertains intellectual conversations, and it open to new experiences. One more thing, I own my home and I am financially stable.

Please leave a little details about yourself, age, location, ethnicity, phone, email address.

I used to think that, as an overweight woman, all I had to offer was my personality (which is pretty awesome sauce) but it turns out that I am also a sex object. Who knew? Now I can't wait to have a man use me for my brain.

I am probably most men's worst nightmare because I want a serious relationship. I don't need to walk down the aisle in a fluffy white dress, but I would like to get married at some point. I am not interested in having kids of my own, but if you have them, that is fine with me. So, I won't put any pressure on you to do these things NOW, but you have to see a commitment with someone in your future in order to get a response from me. 

I am a professional woman with a demanding career. I am ambitious and I take my work, but not myself, very seriously. I only work 40 hours a week, and I have many hobbies, so I am achieving some kind of work-life balance. I am looking for a partner who wants to make plans with me, but also wants to succeed in work and explore his interests. I will give you space, but it would be nice to know that you miss me sometimes.

If you are a mature and educated man, with a serious relationship in mind, I would love to hear from you. Sense of humor is really important to me, and I tend to be the funnier person in the relationship, but I would love for you to show me up. 

I have posted before but never seem to connect with anyone long-term. Follow through is important. I am a woman of action looking for a man of action.

I want to live, I want to give.
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
It's these expressions I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold,
And I'm getting old.

Neil Young's words capture how I feel about finding a man who -- like me -- has a heart of gold.

If you're the one I seek, you're a kind, compassionate, caring gentleman between the ages of 60 and 75 who lives close enough to me so we can play together frequently. I'm hoping you share these qualities that describe me: educated, intelligent, and articulate; energetic and engaged; a non-smoker (of tobacco) but appreciator of wine, spirits, and the herb (all in moderation); financially stable and socially progressive.

Physically, I am of average height and weight (5'4""/~138 lbs.), and considered pretty/attractive...but attraction is personal. While I appreciate lifestyle differences, I'm best matched with a man who -- like me -- is Caucasian, monogamous, and omnivorous. I am interested only in men who are legally and emotionally available -- i.e., single, divorced, or widowed, and not currently partnered.

If you would like to start a conversation, I hope you'll reply to tell me about yourself and why you think we might be a good match. Be sure to include your age and location, and attach a photo. I am happy to reciprocate if we seem well matched.

Hi there, posting this again because I'm still trying to find somebody fun! I'm just wondering where all the decent non-whacko guys have gone?? I mean, I know this is Craigslist and all, but I seriously am wondering if there are still some chivalrous, kind, and genuine guys out there. I'm really not going to write out a huge list of please have and please have nots like some of the ads on here have. That's great if you're looking for your soulmate, by tomorrow lol, but not for just finding awesome people to hang out with and see where it goes. I'm a fairly laid back California native, and I'm just looking for someone to hang out with that won't be a super stalker or wants to pick out a wedding venue on the 3rd date. I mean, that's like a 6th date conversation, maybe 7th, lol. So kidding ;-) I refuse to believe chivalry is dead and I'm sure there has to be a guy out there who wants to join me on activities similar to these: random adventures into SF, day trips to the beach or lakes/river etc, drinking a little too much wine and watching a funny movie, or just hanging out at home cooking up something amazing for dinner. Good cuddlers and amazing huggers are encouraged to apply :-) I'm the anti-chick in that I'm not looking for something super serious from the first email exchange we will have. I just want to connect with someone and find someone who enjoys my company as much as I enjoy theirs. All I ask is that you are: not a tobacco smoker, not married or otherwise romantically involved, gainfully employed, not looking for a hookup, somewhat around my age (around 24-38 but not super picky about it), taller than me is preferable, not more than 30 min away from Walnut Creek, and real. Please include a pic and change the subject to ""Partner in Crime"" to weed out spam. Please only email if you are really interested in getting to know me and hanging out.

I have high standards for a man...I'm a good woman and want a good man. I'm grateful for all I have in my life and for the country in which I was born. Our chemistry includes a mutual sense of humor, lots of mental and physical stimulation - if we can laugh together, we can love together. Deep thinkers who make me laugh are a turn on.

I'm an American-born Latina, self employed, was raised well, and I am very loyal to the man I'm with. I'm told I'm sexy, smart, fun, and sweet. I have awesome kids who are grown, gone, and doing well. I want an old school man with a young spirit, the kind who has manners, who is a warm-hearted man, who has a healthy sex drive, the kind of man who can fix things, he doesn't do yoga, and he likes a good steak. I like the down to earth type who makes me laugh and has my back. Communication is a MUST. I don't like to guess what you're thinking, I try to be pretty clear and honest. I want something LTR, not here to get text pals or play games, I'm into reality and will only date a man where the possibility of falling in love is evident. I work for myself so I have the flexibility to grab my tablet and go, I love my work, but only work to live. I want us both to be a place of refuge for each other, a place of refreshing from the stresses of life.

I'm attracted to hunky white boys with strong morals and big hands.
If we have the chemistry everything will fall into place.

Or better known as herpes.

One in five people have it. Most aren't even aware that they do. 
Some people don't know they have it.
Some people don't care they have it.
Some people don't tell they have it.

I am looking for a SBM over 5'10 that looking for a mate. No drama
Hey craigslist! Not sure if this will even work, but what the hell, why not?!

Recently I found out I was given the ""wonderful"" gift of HSV2, or the genital herpes virus. 

I'm beyond terrified to pass it on, even with condoms and other safe practices. Ideally I'd like to find someone who already has genital herpes. That way neither of us have the stress of ""the talk"" and the fear of rejection even though these days 2 in 5 people have it. 

Herpes does not run my life! (Just my sex life haha) I'm over getting rejected for something I didn't choose. This is the only way to be upfront about it. Not looking to get married tomorrow, but also not looking for a one night stand. Would like to meet someone great and live together in harmony. Want to wait up and cook my other half breakfast in bed. Read the newspaper and laugh together over coffee.


As far as age goes, I'm more than okay with an age gap. Ideally looking for someone roughly 35-50.

Likes SBM over 5'10 so I can wear my heals, with no drama!!!!

Greetings to those who risks to come to this place...

It's an interesting place with a wide range of visitors, who have a huge range of agendas.
To be honest, it's NOT a safe place. Still, it seems to me, if I'm serious enough communicating my ideas and feelings, I can draw the attention of like-minded people of an opposite gender.
I HAVE A QUESTION:
Would you agree that most women are more complicated than most men?
Let me use quotes:
""Men are direct and to the point, and they have no secret meaning behind their words or actions. Women are testers, analyzers and observers.
Biologically, inherently, women are no more ""complicated"" than men. The differences between the two are a result of the gendered characteristics we as a culture have assigned to the sexes. 
Hence the communication difficulties is a majority of heterosexual relationships. 
If you are born with a woman, you aren't raised to be forward and direct and speak your mind. You say what is right, what people want to hear, because confrontation isn't ""ladylike."" You sit in the corner and you play with your dolls and you quietly and quaintly observe the happenings around you until the day you die.
Hence the reason women are, generally speaking, fantastic ""testers, analyzers, and observers.""
If you're born a man, on the other hand, it's nearly the exact opposite. You're raised to be strong and powerful. That's what masculinity is all about. It is your JOB to speak up and speak out, to get things done correctly and quickly. That's how you become a successful provider and therefore a successful male. You play outside with your tool sets and you learn how to build fires and change tires. You get stuff done, and you do it 'til you die.
Hence the reason men are, generally speaking, more ""direct and to the point.""
And this directness, this inability to take the time to stop and think, to look, to analyze, to just observe and think about OTHERS for once--this keystone of masculine ""simplicity"" --it proves no less complications.""


So, did you like the quotes?

I'm NOT one of those women who have had time to ""sit and play with dolls"" . . . I've achieved a lot, raised educated children on my own, moved to a foreign country and survived there.

I do Not look for what 99.99% of people on dating sites come there for: ""cuddling"", ""kisses"", ""beaches""-""FUN FUN FUN."" 

No, I look for REAL things, which include commitment, sometimes the pain of misunderstanding, Real Challenge, Real Trust, Real Love.

I'm here and everywhere for Real Life! And I do have a long, long profile to send you.
What about you? What did you come to this site for?

You:

I guess in a perfect world, you would be looking for a kind and compassionate and smart woman. You might like movies and literature, keeping up with current events, laughing, avoiding the superficial. Just enjoying the beauty of the simple things in life.


You would be masculine, a little old fashioned, and you would see that while I am not very delicate, I am still a woman. I am soft, and compassionate, loving and tender.

I'm a 36yo Filipina with too much free time on her hands. Well, aside from my job, and being caretaker for my dad.

I'm looking for someone to chat with, get to know, share a few interests with; if things click between us it may turn into something more; I'm open to the idea. If not, at least we've become friends. 

I have been told I'm upbeat, hilarious, kind and loyal. I'm a bit reserved at other times, probably because I like to stay neutral. As in I always like to see and understand both sides of the issues at hand. 

I look pretty average, although my ex swears that I look cute, especially around the eyes. I dress tomboyish (because it's comfortable), but can clean up nice depending on the occasion.

I like watching anime, Asian dramas, and comedies. My tastes in music are all over the place, though my current favorites are Kpop and 90s R&B. I do appreciate jazz, since I've played saxophone as a teen. I'm a bit of a foodie, so I like checking out different cuisines/restaurants as well as trying out different recipes. Yes, I can cook. I am a trained artist (and have the BFA to prove it).

So I guess this is the part where I mention what I want in a guy friend. The ideal one would be either Asian or white, hwp, fairly good looking, under 40, share some of the same interests, and at least have their act together. They would also be kind, caring, considerate, positive, and loyal. Most importantly, they don't play games; the last time I posted this the guy who responded decided to see someone else while leading me on. Not cool.

So if you're interested please email me, and we'll see where this goes. Your pic gets mine. And to prove you're real and not a bot, put your favorite fruit in the subject line. (Mine's lychee.)

Thanks for looking. :)

About me: 

Very pretty SWF, size 4, a looker! 
Professional / advanced degrees 
Avid runner 
Yoga practitioner 
Love all things pink and purple 

My smile and eyes are my most prominent and attractive features 
I love the woods 
I love staying up late and seeing the dawn, lazy Sundays in bed with you 

I love to have fun and cut up with someone special - once a special relationship has been established 
Trying to teach myself Italian (slow process) 

A smart, quick thinking man is the ultimate turn-on for me 
I am delightful, delicious, demure, even dainty, subtle, sweet, sexy. 

The type of man I seek: 
I am seeking a successful, confident, and intelligent SWM, 56-72, who knows how to enjoy life. 
A man who will break his routine and try something new, or maybe try something new that he did not enjoy 7 years ago, 
like to learn a new language, a new dance, a new sport (i.e. - cross-country skiing). 

I am seeking a man who is looking for one woman to be his partner - a man who wants a longterm companion to engage in discovery with. 
Prefer a SWM who is well-educated (grad. degrees), sensitive and moved by nature, animals and the arts, a gentleman, kind to everyone 
(including waiters :-), 
successful in his chosen profession and he should still be excited about his professional work. 

Note - a man who dreads his work would not be a good match for me. 

Important - you must be truly single - not separated or married. Age IS important - I look very young - but I am Not attracted to young men. 
I am interested in meeting a SWM between the ages of 56-72. 

An interesting letter and your photo will turn my head and increase the chances that we meet. 
Please respond with a descriptive letter. Picture a Must for a response.

. . .just one man who is age-appropriate (60-75), close in geography (I live mid-peninsula), and similarly inclined (read on).

Neither of us is currently partnered, and we crave the steadfast companionship and deep intimacy we have experienced and expressed in past monogamous relationships. Living long has made us far wiser than we were in our youth. We acknowledge our imperfections and recognize that understanding, compassion, affection, and acceptance are essential to a lasting relationship.

We are both intelligent, articulate people, active and involved, socially and politically liberal, and financially stable. We're still healthy, energetic, and attractive, and we intend to keep ourselves that way for many years to come.

I am HWP (5'4"" tall, ~137 lbs.) and Caucasian. Raised east-coast Jewish, for the past two decades I have been an active member of a progressive religious community that includes people of all persuasions. I am omnivorous, and get along best with those similarly inclined. Semi-retired now, I continue to seek ways to contribute my experience and energy to people and projects that make a difference in the world. Among the pastimes I enjoy are music and dancing, puzzles, cooking and savoring good food and beverage, hiking and exploring (especially with my canine companion), flowers and plants, computers and the Internet, movies and some TV, home maintenance and renovation. My social and political leanings are decidedly liberal/progressive.

If you resonate with this post, I hope you'll write to tell me about yourself (age and location are essential!), what you're looking for, why you're responding. When you do, please attach a current photo; I will happily reciprocate if we seem to be a match.

Down to earth, late 30s, BBW (size 18/20), seeks a regular, heavyset or slim, masculine guy for dating or an LTR. Sorry, not looking for a FWB or ONS.


I go weak in the knees for smart, kind, funny guys. If you like watching The Nightly Show, Key & Peele, or listening to funny podcasts, you're my kind of guy.


I'm brunette, fair complexion, biracial, funny, hard working, and just getting back into the dating scene after a couple of years.


I'm working on living a healthier lifestyle and being a better person and I am looking for someone that is missing that positive person in their life that brings a smile to their face during boring office meetings.


I like regular, masculine guys that aren't into clothing labels or superficial status symbols. If that is you, and a fun date could include a horror movie and lunch or dinner or coffee, then feel free to reply.

I'm a nurse living in the sf bay area seeking a relationship with a SWM or Latino man also in the medical field, preferably a doctor or nurse in the 28 to 37 age range. I'm not seeking a serious relationship right now, but am looking for friendship and casual dating. Maybe it will turn into something more, who knows? What I'm NOT interested in is a texting relationship. I actually want to physically meet you in PERSON! A few emails or texts are fine, but I don't want to be your texting buddy. I don't know why, but I've experienced this a lot from guys on dating sites who do this. I want to actully have a cup of coffee with you or go somewhere fun!

I just want to wrap my arms around you, hug you so tightly! Haha. Love and care for you with time once our friendship has evolved into more...and all I ask in return, is for the same. :)

Seeking: First, chemistry, secondly, a loving friendship that can develop into more. No hookups, no casual sex, no fwb.

You: Geeky, quiet (but not so when you are comfortable with the one you love!), cute in your own unique loving way, slender/slim athlete/average, light eyes, white male
Me: (Only going by what I have been told, btw) Cute, sexy, fun, warm, caring, loving, always smiling. I can be a bit shy but that special someone can easily break me out of that! latina, early 40's

Someone smart said this:

""There's a difference between romance and intimacy. 
Romance is about personality, and intimacy is about character. 

Romance is about the lure of surface chemistry, charm -- your socialized self-playing with somebody else's socialized self. It's superficial stuff and not necessarily long-lasting. Intimacy is about connecting soul-to-soul, character-to-character -- sharing your real self with someone else's real self -- and that's what's necessary for a solid, long-lasting relationship"".

Well said, right? So, I'm looking for a man who understands that statement and agrees with it. 

I'm NOT looking for the cheapness of ""hooking up"", ""healthy sex"",""stress reduction"", ""comfort"", banal ""fun"", which for a great majority of people is associated with ROMANCE. 

INTIMACY is Much More Complex to Develop. And I look for a BRAVE individual who believes that it is possible, and this is what he wants.

I Am a Normal Strong and Loving Woman, who has rained the children and has been building her life without a man for many years, and who believes that it's time to eventually find her match. 

Skype helps! Yes, I do want to CHALLENGE you, a gentleman in your 60s, who has never used skype. This is the 1st test you need to pass having your open face before the camera. 

I can read well between the lines. The level of INTELLECT is something I can immediately notice, and it attracts me.

I am a Very Slavic (Ukrainian/ Belarusian) Woman. To be a Slavic woman of my generation means to be Caring, Supportive and Responsible, Well-Educated, Sensitive, Straightforward, Pretty Old-Fashioned, with a strong sense of how a decent woman should act in this ""unleashed"" world of online dating. 

I'm 63, Pisces, 5.6, average built, dark-haired, hazel-eyed, nice looking.

And, Yes, I Can Support Myself. 

As any woman, I don't like politics and even consider it to be a dirty business, but nowadays politics is everywhere, and, I think, we can't afford our attempts to stay away. I've been helping victims of the war in Ukraine, protesters against KGB in Russia. My nonprofit school, which can operate as charity, tries to help people connect and help each other. 

I am a proud mother of two beautiful, well-educated daughters, who are in their 30s, married and on their own.

I have lived in US since 2002 and am its citizen. Educator (teacher of music and languages), small school owner, very passionate about my work and children (not only my own). Those little ones refresh my heart and brain and help me stay connected to that little Ukrainian girl in me.

Do you know that ""it's tiring for children to explain everything to adults,"" and that only the adult who is capable of saving a child in his soul is worthy? 

HOW I AM DRESSED: yes, most of the time I'm dressed-up like any Slavic woman at work. But I do like to hike, to bike, and to camp,.

MUSIC: As a classically trained piano teacher, I do love the music I teach. That doesn't mean that my partner has to be in love with it. If you are frustrated that you don't like opera, I can tell you that I do not like Giants and golf:-) and will Never go with you to watch them.

I'm NOT a PARTY PERSON at all. I feel extremely bored there. 

I do love Literature, including poetry, and I teach Russian language and literature ( have a degree) 

Although I'm Open, Honest and Strong, I'm OPPOSITE to feminists. There is a good room for a man, whom I'm looking for, by my side.

I would say I am TRANSPARENT. Are you too?

And so on and on... I do have a lot to say, and I hope you too!

What do women bring to Life aside of the Life they give to the babies? 

Yes, Devotion and Beauty. They are your Source of Inspiration, They are less tested by increasing hormone level; that's why usually they are better committed partners than men.
Right?
And you know that the level of civilization should be measured by its attitude to a Woman too? 
Good for you!
Then let's talk a little.

I've just turned 63 (Pisces) . Although not a Grandma yet but nice looking, youthful in mind and body woman, I know that the biggest part of my journey has been already lived up. I need to make its final part full of Dignity and Beauty. 
I'm NOT an American ""gal"" (not Asian nor Hispanic). Guess where attractive women are educated, serious and kind... They are also responsible for their country. 

But I'm a US citizen now...

I'm tired of being a plane with one wing but ready to stay alone till death if my Dignified Man doesn't appear before. 

I've got education ( multiple degrees), built my career, raised the children and made a certain number of mistakes, which I would like to avoid repeating.

It seems to me that what an Intelligent, Decent and Honest woman, looking for a partner for a final chapter of her life, needs to think of is how this man relates to her in terms of :

1) her views and beliefs ( I have a high spirit, believe in education, am opposite to feminists but can't be told what to do by anybody. I greet the wind in the face!), 2) her attitude to politics (I'm active and passionate about what I believe in. In short, I'm an activist), 3) the work she does ( I'm going to never retire as I love my teaching profession and can always work part time, while having an opportunity to choose when and how much to work, and this is my way of expressing myself in life);
4) how compatible their characters are. (I'm peaceful, friendly, dignified, not materialistic and not diplomatic-just desperately sincere and unable to stand insincere, indecisive and fearful beings.) I can't be ""controlled"" by the man as I'm absolutely committed by nature. I will ask for advice myself but won't stand constant ""corrections"". To put it in a nutshell, I'm Not a Follower and Not a Leader. I can only walk by the side of my equal. An ""alpha male"" isn't my match for sure.
5) if they are compatible sexually. By this age, too many men have lost their potency while women, after having given all they should to the children and families, are still up to experiencing the richness of love life with the Men they Can Respect and Love.

Right, it's Very Hard to Meet Such Men on Dating Sites. 

We love with our soul and body, don't we? I'm passionate and intense if in love (You know that Love Is Demanding, right?), and I want to be on fire and to have a chance to TRUST every step my partner makes. As a devoted and reliable friend, and I need to feel the reciprocation of the same level; otherwise, my feminine pride will push me to leaving. 

Yes, your Celebrating the Existence of Women is Welcome:-)

I've been out of dating market for a couple of years, caught up with family matters, definitely my dating skills got rusted but the spirit of upcoming BD sends this vibration and I got the idea to open a profile in Match. . .and it was a very strange experience. . .it looked like that site is a community of picture/profile collectors and military men who has a very similar life story and are desperately seeking for the place to settle down. I closed my profile after second week. I have been lucky with CL in the past, so I try it again. I've read men's ads but never responded, so I really appreciate your courage to click the button Reply.
About me: a midage woman, not drop dead gorgeous any more but traces of that youth glory are still present and noticeable, well dressed and very well educated, I've never been overweight, do not follow any special diet, just healthy living and moderate exercise, Slavic blood, lived in different countries, so I carry mixed cultural habits, speak languages from different language groups, do not follow any traditions, religions but very curios to explore new cultures, rites, laws. . .SF is a good place for that, I live here for more than a decade and seems I've got everything to be the happiest one in this city and definitely I will be when meet you.. You are my BD wish and I take it seriously, do not fall from your chair laughing too loud, the process is usually more interesting than the aim itself ...I am not a romantic fool but used to hear that I wear my heart on a sleeve, I want to be more secretive but probably it's too late to get this trait so I'm vulnerable and open and doesn't matter that I look like very confident and tough. . .it's just a look. I will be very mellow with an open, giving, nurturing man and I can be very sarcastic and rude with a jerk. I'm friendly and have been told from left and right that I make people feel comfortable and relaxed, probably too friendly since my grown kids still live with me and I think it is time to make them feel less comfortable focusing on my personal life and I expect your help in this endeavor. 
How I visualize you: positive, authentic, mentally-emotionally-physically-financially balanced, expressive in what is important to him and what he wants next in his life, open-minded, curious, interested in learning new things, new people, other cultures, who is capable of loving relationships, someone who is more than himself. . .Physical attractiveness is important, for me it is an indicator of a good health and the habits to take care of yourself and overall healthy life style, so, please, be somehow attractive and not only for your mom's eyes but listen what your buddies say...I admire 6-pack abs and nicely shaped buttocks but I know already that all it fades with time and if there's nothing inside then there's no cure for it. . .so, please, be educated and at least familiar with the European map and history so you will not get surprised that Slovenia and Slovakia is not the same country. . .I am not a pro with American history and I would be delighted if you tell me about facts I do not know. . .I am not looking for a new husband; and I am definitely not looking for Gigolo, a boy-toy, I'm also not interested in one night stands. I would go for equal relationships: to come together to share our lives, to enjoy the finer things in life. . . You know that feeling, when your heart is pumping when you see the message on your phone or just hear the voice. . . these are the moments we all want to experience again and again! 
Chemistry is the key for that unique sensual connection and mutual physical attraction. As I said I can be friends with anyone but the romance is different. You might like one's photo and writings but you have to meet them, look into their eyes and be yourself with them and be liked by them. We can tell within few minutes of meeting if there is any physical chemistry between us. 
Please, live in SF that we can easily get together for spontaneous outings after work or weekends when that vibe and our time get in sync. . .I personally cannot respect cheaters, so you should be a single, divorced, widower, and not ""traveling adventurous"", bisex, trans, and other local trends, I am not interested to explore this part deeper, I have already enough info about it from media, parade and a couple of local friends. 

Many thanks for the reading to this point, I'm impressed already if you reach this point!

I'm an energetic outgoing single good black woman that work hard and can hold my own and looking for the same in a good man. I believe life is what you make it and it's twice as nice with the right partner. I do think chemistry is of the utmost importance; however honesty, integrity and loyalty are keys to a great relationship. I like doing thing inside and outside, traveling, shopping comedy; music concerts working out and plays in addition to cooking and just about anything as long as I am not harmed and at times watching TV with that special one just doing whatever.
I have kissed a few frogs and I'm ready to kiss my last frog to get to my life partner.

Light up your life by making an electrically charged connection with this 
high voltage - looks, brains, laughter - woman. 

Seeking a SM - Over 56! 

Don't be shocked that I'm open to a wide range of your possible age. But do be 
over 56 (no youngsters, please.) mature men have wit and patience, especially if they have heart-heightened 
emotions that don't require defibrillation. I'm talking about enthusiasm for life. 

-If you have a romantic spark that could light us up like a sudden bolt of lightning 
-If music sends epileptic tingles up and down your spine 
-If you can't live without a frequent volt of humor 
-If your cerebral circuits are hard wired toward brilliance 
-If your emotional self is hot wired for the eventual fireworks of well-grounded love 
-If you're yearning for a jolt of the power that invigorates your elemental connectivity, that 
shimmers in the emerging recesses of your soul, aching for the tender tingling of electric touch 

Then I'm plugged in to receive your exceptional signal. But you must be on my wavelength. 
(One of my favorite Van Morrison songs :-) 


Me - cute, feisty, thin - size 4, grad degrees plus modesty; lithe and athletic, love late night kisses, Dire Straits, Bonnard, Bach and chocolate anything. 
Caution: High-voltage female intellect emitting frequent sparks of humor and eclectic, spirited 
conversation is only electrified by high-wattage self-confidence in a man who has a shining 
soul, a spirit that magnetizes, and a magnificent tendency toward generosity, magnanimity. 

If you're my electrical equal, electrify me now. Touch me by lighting up my life with your words. 
Send a photo for the physical sparks.

We all have many layers to us. If you saw me on the street--don't deny it--you'd size me up. Since you're doing this online I'll help. I'm 5' 8"", blonde, and wear glasses. Not a will o' the wisp sort but I've got plenty of muscle and the right kind of curves. It's okay, go ahead and stare. :-)

Next you'd notice my smile and laugh...if you talked to me you'd find out I'm wry, liberal, direct, and well-educated. An outsized, friendly personality.

If you asked me out you'd notice my presence, warmth, and natural curiosity. I'd try to figure out if we're compatible by talking about some of my favorite movies (Ice Storm, Big Lebowski, Fantastic Mr. Fox), music (Bach, Miles, Monk, Richard Thompson, Sharon Jones, and much more) food (lasagna, roasted chicken), or things to do (hiking, running, window shopping). I'd have to talk about my kids (hopefully you're interested), because they are a constant driving force in everything I do. I may or may not talk about my work, which is satisfying and challenging. There would be plenty of questions asked of you...a natural, easy give & take.

If after this date you wanted to keep seeing me, you'd come to know me well and appreciate that I'm a steady, caring woman; incredibly determined with a softer inner core; a great cook; really good at making things happen. That my librarian looks belie something more sensual than you were expecting. Most important of all: that I have a pretty decent bead on life and I'm incredibly happy where I'm at, which makes me a great person to be around. I could keep going but I need to save something for later. 

How about you? What's in your layers? Do you know yourself to the core?

Looking to have steady, monogamous, heartfelt fun on the way to something lasting with someone established/educated/SINGLE, 45-55, East Bay-based. If you choose to write, please change the subject of your reply to your birth month.

Hi,

I saw an Asian man with really good hair at Northgate. He was very manly with a deep voice and a big adam's apple. Lean, well-dressed, casual, cool, and looks like he's good at physical things. Lots of charisma. Perfect features, very handsome. Older. 40's? Walking by me near the food court, talking to his male friend.

I liked what I saw but I was working very hard. That and I like to be approached.

I'm skilled beyond reason in the seductive arts, and can be as beautiful as a princess, but don't bother with my appearance if I don't have to.

You seem difficult, but so am I, so it might be hard, but I'm sure that a little water could make things right.

I don't know your nationality, but if you're Japanese, I speak a little.

I learn quick too.

You have to be sharp to figure me out, and I will try to be too.

Also, you remind me of someone I knew before.

Hi,

Im a single girl here in Santa Cruz and Im looking for someone who wants to run the Rugged Maniac with me in May, google it if you don't know what it is. It is super fun and while I want to do my best, Im not super competitive..... well sort of I am, but Im no where near fit enough to actually be competitive, lol.

Im not super fit or anything, in fact Im probably closer to a beginner when it comes to fitness. But I like to lift heavy, I currently squat 180lbs, I could probably go heavier if I had a spotter. My weakness is definitely upper body strength but Im working on it. I can run 3, 11 minute miles with a level 3 incline, not impressive but again Im working on it. 

So basically Im looking for someone who wants to train or just hang out and be fit/healthy. If you do want to train it would be great if you went to In-shape fitness in Capitola but if not no problem. Either way, we would hang out and get to know each other and in May run the race together. If things work out we could keep working out together/hanging out and see where it goes. 

So email me if you're interested in running the race with me. I've already bought my ticket, it was $80. Please only reply if you're really serious and would be willing to meet up and if things work out, buy your ticket too.
