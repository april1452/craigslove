Hello. I am a single white woman seeking a single white man, 60ish or older please. I am an educated woman with many positive attributes such as a great personality, a love of life and family and God, I have solid core values, live in a lovely community (I own my home), and generally lead a very good life. I have been alone for quite some time, so I am of the belief it is time to get out there and see if I can rustle up a good man. Is that you? My children are all grown and out of the nest and there is nothing holding me back at this point in my life. I enjoy the arts; theatre, opera, concerts, museums and plays. I have done quite a bit of traveling over the years, and I would like to plan a trip to Italy later this year. It would be nice to enjoy a travelling companion to my mother's home city and country...Rome, Italy. I enjoy board games, and can play poker pretty well, although I have yet to sit at a card table in Black Hawk or Central City. (My father was a professional poker back in the day). I have long brown hair with lots of highlights, brown eyes, red lips, red finger nails and red toe nails...lolol. I am able to dress it up, or knock around in a pair of jeans, although I prefer dressing up . I'm a retired paralegal. To keep myself busy i now work as a caregiver. Rather than bore you with all my sterling attributes, why not contact me and share yourself and who you are, your age, ethnicity, are you single and who knows? Maybe we will click. Oh, by the way, I am not hard on the eyes. Ciao baby.

Hello,

To start out I am 31 years old. I am a mother to 2 boys and share custody 50/50 with their father! I work full time and go to school part time. 

I am a fun loving woman with a sarcastic, spunky personality! I am not looking for someone to screw around with. I am looking for a friend and lets see what happens next. I am confident in my own skin, I have had 2 kids, I am not tiny but I am healthy. I am active and love to stay active. I am a woman who knows what she wants and normally go for it. I love to laugh (who doesn't), I love to enjoy a beer or a few. Love hanging out with my friends and family. My kids are my life but I love to enjoy me time also. I love to be outside, hiking, fishing, four wheeling, camping, ANYTHING really!! I am not down for drama but I am a woman after all and tend to embrace my emotions. One thing with me, you will never be guessing where you stand. I do have some ink but definitely looking to get more! Music is my outlet! I am more a country girl but I am always up for new music. I am not looking for a baby daddy, my ex husband and I get along really well. I adore his girlfriend and we are really close friends. 

What I look for in a guy? I look for someone who is into the same things I am. I am looking for a bit of a bad boy with good boy qualities... meaning I want someone who will be respectful in public and show affection but isn't afraid to own his wild side too! I don't have a certain type! I have dated all types of guys, it's about the connection. If you can make me smile and understand my spunky personality then we will get along just fine!! 

I will send you a picture once you have sent me one. 


If I sound interesting, hit me up!

My posting has been up a short while and I already have to edit... Please, I am not looking for a one night stand. Do not send dirty pics. Also, I would prefer to find someone that has weekends off so that we can do things together. 


Why do we make dating harder than it really is? Is it wrong to just grab dinner or a coffee and talk? Why is there so much pressure for it to go perfect? So, you may not be attracted to that person when you meet, but why does that mean you can't have a good evening? Two adults should be able to talk and have a good time without all the prejudice that comes along. With that being said, I am looking for someone who is mature, stable, outgoing and well rounded. I know this is Craigslist, but I know there are good men out there. It feels like we have to put warning labels on our ads these days. I should not have to say that I am looking for someone that is single. If you are not single, you should not be looking. If you have a STD, go on a STD dating site.. It seems simple, but people do not get it. 

A little about myself:

Single
I Have a career
My own place
Car
Good head on my shoulders
I am active

Things I enjoy:

Love the outdoors

Are you tired of the same game day after day? Are you tired of meeting people with no ambition?

I know I am. I understand that we all have issues and things that we deal with, but I am getting to a point
where I want to find someone normal. I am not looking to be someone's counselor or sponsor.

I tend to find the ones that have addictions, mental disorders, are married, like to play games, lie, cheat etc... How old are we? Dating again has made me feel like I was back in high school. Why has dating become and all or nothing type of thing? Why can't two adults go to dinner or have drinks without it meaning you have to get married? Just because you may not be attracted to that person does not mean you can't have a nice time with them. If you are meeting people with rejection issues then maybe try a different site.

I enjoy the nice things in life, quiet candlelight dinners, watching a movie by the fire, laying in bed just talking about our goals, dreams, desires. When was the last time you found yourself still talking as the sun came up? Those are the best nights.

Gotcha with the headline! It will be changed if I am flagged.

I enjoy many things. I like to camp, hike, go for long weekend trips to anywhere the car takes us. I like adventure and having a good time. I am an extravert with type A personality. Just getting that out there.

I am big on communication. That is the key to a successful relationship. I do not want or need drama.

I do have a career in which I am grateful for. I am just looking for a great man to share life with.

Please be no older than 50, non smoker, employed and mentally ready for a relationship.

Hello,

I'm looking for a long term relationship. A little about myself SASSY, African American female, 39, single, live alone, own car, drama free, NO KIDS, educated with a career. In my free time I love to cook, read, dine out, bowl, attend a basketball game, exercise, and just enjoy all that life has to offer. I'm interested in a single man between the ages of 35-45, who is loyal, smart, caring, independent, attractive, healthy, in decent shape, non smoker, loves to travel, and good communicator. I'm not sharing any pictures over the internet so don't ask for one. If I feel we are a match I'll send a photo via text or facetime you later. A picture isn't required at the moment but please send me a description of yourself and what you like to do for fun. 

Thanks for browsing my post

I'm looking for someone sane, stable, mature, and knows what they want out of life. Someone would like to get to know each other over a drink or coffee and do something uncommon in today's world........actually date. I'm mid 20's, attractive, active, love life, and intelligent. If you like what you have read so far, shoot me an email with what state we live in and a picture attached would be great and a bit about yourself 😊. Looking forward to hearing from you!

I have been working too much the last year. I really do enjoy what I do, and strive to be successful, but a girl can't live on work alone! I want to meet someone that I will be so excited to spend time with that I leave work at a reasonable hour and stop working on Sundays. 

Who will excite me? We all have preferences when it comes to the physical qualities. I love a tall man - 6 foot or taller and I prefer men my age or older - 45 to early 50's. When I was a teenager, I used to be told I look like Phoebe Cates. If you have no idea who she is, then you are probably too young for me. I tend to be attracted to a clean-cut, somewhat conservative look. I love when people have their own individual style, but I am just not attracted to men with lots of tattoo's or piercings. What can I say, I love a man in dress pants and a button up shirt. 

I am 45, never married and I have no children. I am 5'7"" and slender, but with some curves. These days, I get told I look like Tea Leoni. (I am the first to admit I am not a natural blonde). I don't see the resemblance, but it's a compliment so I smile and say thank you. Madame Secretary is tall, thin, smart and a great boss to her employees - why wouldn't I want to be compared to her? 

The rest is chemistry and there is no list for that. Let's see what happens...

This is Colorado and I love everything this state has to offer. Like most, I have had my share of good and bad relationships. But to give up and be alone is not something I want to do. I enjoy being in a relationship and sharing things together...I will still continue to have an optimistic attitude that there is someone out there for me. I do believe in the season, reason and lifetime, that does sound cliche, people do come in to your life (or you allow people to come in to your life) for certain things. I am not necessarily looking for a lifetime at first (but I am definitely open to it). More about...I am 5'7"" about 125lbs. Auburn hair, fair skin, green-grey eyes, freckles. I enjoy camping, fishing (YES fishing except you have to gut!!), photography, traveling this beautiful state, Glenwood Springs, anything outdoors, anything indoors, watching TV, cuddling, cooking, taking bubble baths, did I mention photography?, gardening, going antique shopping, thrift store, estate sales, buying old stuff and trying to make it new again. I am 420 friendly, and a productive member of society. I do not smoke ciggies and I do drink socially. I've been accused of driving a little faster than normal, listening to the radio a bit louder than I should, possibly listening to too much 80 music. If you send a photo I promise to return one, I am 100% real.

If you are between the age of 50-65, PLEASE be 6 ft tall or almost there, weight isn't that important, although I do expect you be active. I prefer a guy who works with his hands, more the outdoors type, someone who can fix and build things, someone who likes horses and animals. Someone who is rough on the outside but tender on the inside. A man who still has a good relationship with his family, kids are not a problem as long as there is no drama and you have time for a relationship!

Ha! Going back a few years! So are you in the Denver / Metro area?

Intelligent, an out of the box thinker, classy, youthful, outgoing, spontaneous, confident, mannered, outspoken, compassionate, loyal, direct, and optimistic with a dry sense of humor, penetrating eyes, longer tastefully greying hair, elegant to artsy to Nike with a bit of old hippie thrown in. I have been labeled as sensual, edgy, alluring, mysterious, and recently, as being ""east coast poise with noise""....all these adjectives from men, for what that's worth.

I have gained something good from every relationship I have been in. I harbor no ill will towards my past. Two kids, grown, gone, but close with me, no grandkids, though I love the ones my friends have.

I am passionate about music, (enjoy most types, especially live, but nooooo country) literature, writing and most arts. I like to cook light and fresh foods, sing, dance, read, study history, have meaningful conversations, check out architecture, see movies on the big screen, live sports, museums, libraries, old buildings, galleries, ....kinda eclectic interest wise, I guess...I am fine hanging at home watching something good on tv. I am not an ""X-treme"" outdoors type; I don't ski, scale mountains, or raft....yet....I do love being out of doors...am not a biker babe, but would enjoy riding behind you. Really enjoy checking out new eateries, especially indie ones, not into Vietnamese, Mexican, or deep fried anything.

I would love to meet an intelligent, classy guy who shares some of the same things, no longer has younger than high school kids at home, isn't married, separated, or has a more than necessarily civil relationship with an ex-wife, and is ready to start a new history with me. It is important to me that you do not smoke, and care enough about yourself to be doing the requisite nutrition/exercise/lifestyle deal that has kept you attractive.... both inside and out.

I am seeking intimacy on several levels, and some things I value most in a partner are humor, integrity, courage, and loyalty. I think how you treat and speak to and about others bespeaks volumes about you, and I really notice those things. I love dignity of presence and a kind heart. As for the ""looking for someone to complete me"" or my ""soulmate"" - no, not me. Still working on my own puzzle!

The endless email thing doesn't interest me, and texting to me is something that comes after we get comfortable with one another, not as a way of establishing a relationship. 

I would like to add something here that you may find odd, but I'm going to say it anyway. I have posted here before a couple of times last year and have also tried a couple of dating sites. Each time and place, I have been contacted by men who have sent extremely attractive photos and who each have said they are of European background, work for an oil/engineering firm based out of Texas, and are ending their employment with either a plan to move to CO or with some family member who has a home in Lakewood where the stay when they return from Europe....they won't talk on the phone and when I have pressed for a chat, they disappear. If that is you, please don't bother responding, like the military officers in Afghanistan who are widows with young teenage daughters, CL is on to your scam.

I absolutely cannot post a photo here because of some dating site nut jobs, but I would like to see yours, without sunglasses (the eyes say so much) so I can know you are a real person. 

So if you have read this far, please send a note with your photo in which I can see your handsome face and eyes and please tell me about you - the basic who what where when type things so I can have a more complete idea about you and what you are seeking. I will message back if you do and if I think we may have a niche to explore. I am from NYC and have been in Denver for almost 25 years. 

Ready to start making those first and last phone calls of the day....

Summer is headed our way. So many great things to do. Live music festivals, Red Rocks, bike riding, hiking, BBQ's, baseball, people watching, garage sales, sitting by the fire pit listening to music, camping and love under the stars (sigh), weekend road trips, motorcycle rides perhaps? The list goes on. Maybe you are feeling the same way and looking forward to it all but hoping to find someone to do all these great things with. Reach out. Take a chance. Let's meet and get to know each other.

Me?
Single, sweet, a bit sassy (but in a good way), simple (but not simple minded), real, honest.

You?
Single, sensible, sane. A man who knows what he is looking for in a good woman and is in a good place to find her, keep her and never let her go. 

Looking for friendship, romance and love with one good man. 
The perfect first date? Laughing...

Hello Gentlemans Meet the right person it is hard, I want to find a simple guy, thats spreads positive energy, the energy is contagious. When you do good things and you are happy in your life you send those good vibes out... Those good energy come right back to you. why im not expect to find a handsome outside but rotten inside? I prefer a free soul with thirsty to live . The life is Short and there are alot to learn. I want someone not only with a beauty face but with a big heart to walk together, support each other , learn from each other. As a human we have hard time. I want to cuddling someone with careless, when he feel dejected. Meet a perfect man isn't my target .Rather I m looking for someone honest, funny and clean be happy with his life. With positive attitude, and great sense of humor . I'm single Mom 46 I appreciate alot the small moments, I'm dream that one day i can be setting together on the beach kiss us deep and feeling butterfly. Happiness is a choice, not a result. Nothing outside of you will make you happy. You must choose be happy, feel great ful and then share that with the world. Of course take care of outside it is important also. Be on balance I think is the secret. I'll be happy to answer any ad. I'm Hispanic with many dreams. I love to cook and I prefer some from 35 to 50. I'm no skinny . only for serious relationship please don't waste your time if you have compromise with another woman. I love music I can conceiving the life without Music Also I'm no interesting in some to smoke or use drugs at all.

Hello everyone out there. I am newish to the area. I grew up here but haven't live here for awhile now. I didn't keep in touch with many people who still live in the valley and am not making friends at work because I work as a sub on assignment and I haven't been in any one class long enough to get to know anyone there. 
I do have a very short list of friends including my best friend who lives with me along with her 2 daughters. I don't have kids but since we live together I do have kids at home and that complicates some stuff. And afterall I'm looking for some outside of my house friends. 
Like I said I work as a substitute teacher and I aspire to making teaching a more permanent thing. Or maybe I will be a Mason. I have been enjoying the freedoms freelancing. I try to work everyday but there aren't always jobs and on those days I have plenty to distract myself with but like anyone I'd like to find someone to join me on some of these free days. 
I want to go visit Woodward Park. I've never been! It's snowy now and I don't have chains for my own car but maybe we can visit fish camp. 
My sister lives on Orange County and I drive out there often. This weekend that's where I will be celebrating my birthday! Maybe you like road trips. I love them. In the spring I'm going to Rock Fiesta in Arizona. It's a camp out and I'm not an experienced camper so, I'm nervous about maintaining a minimum amount of comfort. I would like to sleep well. 2 long days requires some good sleep. Do you like goin to rock shows? I do. It's one of my fave ways to blow my last few dollars. Sometimes it's worth living poor to end up seeing My Morning Jacket, Cafe Tacvba, Deftones, Tool or some other bands live. Let's go see a show together. 
Let's watch some tv. Winter is coming and Game of thrones comes back soon. Maybe the walking dead? 
I like going out for taco Tuesday and having some beers. The Tioga Springs beer garden is nice. I'd love to go back with someone. I've also been to Peeves Public house. They have good prices beer pints and an outdoor patio. Show me a place you like to have drinks. I'm a beer person myself but a mixed drink or some nice whiskey sometimes hits the spot. 
I guess what I'm looking for starts to sound like activity partner but it's not. I'd like to get to know you and become good friends. Maybe we click or hit it off or whatever. 
I into my 30's. I am single. Never been married. 3 exes in far distant lands. 
I like to travel and airfares are dropping right around now. Who wants to go visit Chicago because it's $150 airfare round trip? Let's go have deep dish pizza. Visit a museum or my college pub. 
I into science fiction. I enjoyed the new Star Wars very much. Can't wait for more. This summer's Star Trek is much anticipated. This is tre of probably everyone in the world but still with mentioning I think. I'd like to go see Star Wars again and I might go by myself but I'm putting the feelers out to maybe find someone to accompany me. It'll be fun. 
Having said a bunch of stuff and gone on and on I would like to now add that I am into 420. It my favorite way to relax and I like to go out that way. It's not an always thing but sometimes with other like minded people it can get to be. I still lead an active productive life. Clearly I'm not drug free and I know some of you aren't into that.
I'm ok with marijuana but not really much else. Drinking and toking. That's it.

About Me: I'm a separated single mom of 1 living in LA with a fast paced career and normal adult responsibilities but I'm still seeking a lust for life. I hope I can include someone fun and actually available (not too busy with everyday life to have fun and a steady woman) to share convo, time and see what happens. Now don't get me twisted. . .I have no preconceived expectations or plans for you, my brain isn't the headquarters of the Norman Bates Motel. Every relationship between a man & woman develops, interacts and fits together differently so I'm not invested in the notion that because you and I are chilling or talking that we HAVE to be working towards happily ever after, we may end up only sharing a walk of shame or nothing at all, it can all develop organically. Of course that's not my goal but I'm not an idiot that boxes everything into only 1 scenario.

My Type: So, we can't help what makes us say yum, right? I prefer a tall, white man (our interests align much better, I can't help that my brain made this my preference, no I will not make an exception and I'm a sucker for the light eyes), in between the ages of about 28-38, employed & has a car for cripes sake! Look, you don't have to work for a fortune 500 but on the flip side, I don't want to have to pay for your happy meal if we go out together.Must be Current or former Military or Law enforcement because I have an Ex who could be a problem and need someone who can handle themselves, or look after me should it come to it.

Me: BBW (that means a big girl boys), Mexican, black hair, brown eyes, lighter mocha colored. I like to think if you're a chunky dunker you wouldn't kick me out of bed in the morning once the lights are on.

Likes: I LOVE country music and all related country-esque past times and rock of all genres, can't forget that. I dig going off roading even if haven't done it in forever, love icky dive bars, camping, concerts, road trips, a funny DVD at home, blah blah blah you know, cool stuff not dumb crap like: Crochet, couple's anything, Pinterest, the Kardashian sluts, pottery classes, candy crush, pretentious conversations about crap that doesn't matter, small rat dogs, chick flicks, embroidered cat pillows or video games (sorry boys, I wont stop you but I'm not feeding the madness either) -- More items to come as I think of them.

Please don't flag, I am a real woman just hoping to meet someone. The last few days here in Denver have been beautiful. I hope the weekend will be the same.

I am posting in hopes to find a good guy who would ideally want a relationship. I know he is out there somewhere and know that with persistence he will show up :) I am not looking for perfect, but I am looking for ""perfect for me."" About me- I am 45 year old. I am a mom... which means I can't be as spontaneous as I would sometimes like to be. I am very honest and strive to be kind and understanding. I am very affectionate, funny, and passionate. I don't smoke and rarely drink. I am not a fan of marijuana and would prefer not to date someone who is. I am a spiritual person.... I am looking for a guy who knows how to be honest and always respectful. Someone who loves children- maybe even someone who has a child as well. I would love someone who has no problem talking about how he feels and what he thinks. Intelligent conversations can be a great turn on. I am a very affectionate person and fo better with someone who is as well. Soooo if this sounds at all interesting to you I would love to hear from you... maybe we would be ""perfect"" together.

Searching for the right man for long term, doing things together, build a family to care for one another, prefer you are a passionate, mature, and stable or an Asian culture is a big plus.

I'm 35 something, educated, employed, petite, average, loyalty, emotional capable but strong willed even though I believe in second chances, enjoy home cooked meals, conversations, outdoor activities, and some of my interests is in humanity and love animals.

My view in a good relationship pretty simple; be willing and never take your love ones for granted. Communication is the key.

Normally I wouldn't be getting on Craigslist to find love but I'm having such a hard time meeting like minded people. I am a very deep person so I expect you to be too if you are thinking about replying this post. To better explain the title of this posting, I would have to get into my beliefs which are complicated and simple at the same time. I believe that everything is one/connected. That God fragmented itself in order to experience the illusion of separation to escape the painful truth that it is all alone(and bored) as well as evolve and experience an infinite amount of things. I believe that a new age of peace and enlightenment is coming.

My goal is to meet a guy that resonates with me on most, if not all levels, and I would like to make a van into our home(traveling home). I would like to live in the woods, country or mountains. I do not like the city at all. I am vegan for spiritual, health, mental, emotional, ethical, and environmental reasons so you either need to be vegan too or respect the fact that I'm a vegan and not make jokes about me because of it. I love deep conversations and cannot stand small talk so please do not ask me if I'm working or going to school. My job or career does not define me and I know that the monetary system is a covert form of slavery. I don't want to date someone over the age of 30(I'm 21). I don't want to date someone that has kids, has been married or engaged before or still has feelings for their ex. I don't want to date someone that lies, cheats or pretends. I want to date someone that I can be my absolute self with and I want them to be their absolute self with me. If I can't fart around you, I know it will never work between us haha. I want something deeply intimate. I want to merge with someone and become one with them. There's a lot more to me than this. If you have any questions, ask me. Please respond with something interest about yourself. Make the subject of the message ""Banana butts"" so that I know that you read the whole thing.

Well beyond having that in common, tell me your idea of a great experience in finding someone here. 
If you found me you might say; 
I met a woman who laughs, is friendly and has a sexy smile when she is laughing, She seems to understand me. She looks at me like she cares. I first noticed she is very busty. On the plus size side.I like that. She seems comfortable with herself. We had good conversation, we went and had a drink, hung out, slow danced a little. 
I met her fun family. The place is nice, comfortable, everyone is friendly. This is her life. She loves and takes pride in her household role with the kids and folks she takes care of. Oh and the pets too. She works at home and makes good money. The place is neat and clean. We spend time here and also get out a couple of nights a week. Weekend getaways are in the works. 
So if I meet you will I find...
a man who is bright, confident, sensual, well mannered as need be, funny and can get silly, sensual (oh darn, did I say that already...) someone who loves life and people mostly (sarcasm is a complex thing ;p )and most of all wants to have a life enhancing relationship. That could take many forms. Maybe FWB that becomes a much deeper thing. That is ideal to me and if there is some reason that blocks that, well, you lose a few percentage points... like 100%.

I am wanting to take the time and effort to get to know someone in all aspects, not be pressured to go into a long term relationship right away, and be comfortable with eachother.
I enjoy having a conversation with someone who understands that not having the exact same interests as another person is okay. I love learning new things from other people, exploring a new territory, finding a hidden gem downtown to grab a bite, and dancing. 
I'm not asking you to be my boyfriend, or for you to have sex with me the first time we meet. If we happen to just be good friends, why is that not acceptable? If we happen to connect and want more, why not?

They both know that I still feel as something is missing from my life. Just what that is I don't know yet.

Hello. I am a single white woman seeking a single white man, 60ish or older please. I am an educated woman with many positive attributes such as a great personality, a love of life and family and God, I have solid core values, live in a lovely community (I own my home), and generally lead a very good life. I have been alone for quite some time, so I am of the belief it is time to get out there and see if I can rustle up a good man. Is that you? My children are all grown and out of the nest and there is nothing holding me back at this point in my life. I enjoy the arts; theatre, opera, concerts, museums and plays. I have done quite a bit of traveling over the years, and I would like to plan a trip to Italy. Spent twenty days in Rome ten years ago...ready to return. I am 100% Italian! The best Italian cook in North America!! I enjoy board games, and can play poker pretty well, although I have yet to sit at a card table in Black Hawk or Central City. (My father was a professional poker back in the day). I have long brown hair with lots of highlights, brown eyes, red lips, red finger nails and red toe nails...lolol. I am able to dress it up, or knock around in a pair of jeans, although I prefer dressing up if and when I go out on the town. Rather than bore you with all my sterling attributes, why not contact me and share yourself and who you are, your age, ethnicuty, are you single and who knows? Maybe we will click. Oh, by the way, I am not hard on the eyes. Thanks for taking an interest.

A little about me, I am 29 swf that is 5'4 brown hair and blue eyes. I am family oriented and not much into drinking, so bars are not my scene. (Also no 420 or other drugs) I like to go see new places, so many things to do in Colorado alone. I have a job which takes up most of my week. I am not looking for Prince Charming, I am looking for my best friend. I just want someone who wants to share their life with me and I can do the same.

This is a long shot on CL, but here goes nothing...
I'm almost 30, SWF, never been married, no kids, live alone and have a career. However, my biological clock is ticking. I'd love to be married and have a family someday. Are there any older or mature men that want the same thing? That 'old fashioned' love that comes from creating a real relationship built on communication and trust. 

I love to laugh, go on adventures, camping, hiking etc. going to concerts, comedy clubs or watching Netflix on a snowy day like today. My parents have been married for 30+ years and while it hasn't been the perfect marriage, I admire what they have. I'd like to have that some day. So is there anyone out there reading this that wants more than a one night stand or fwb?

I'm looking for a guy who is taller than me (I like to wear heels on occasion) genuine, funny, intelligent, and mature. I'm not going to lie and say I'm a Barbie doll, I'm a little heavy and have curves, so if you don't think you'd be attracted to me, then move along. I'm a beautiful woman with confidence and know what I want. 

Please put your first name in the subject line to weed out spam. Send a pic if you like, but I don't need one on your first email. Hope there is a nice guy out there!

I'm not looking for a super serious relationship, nor am I looking for someone who only wants to fuck. I'd like to meet someone who wants to do things together (including but not limited to eat meals, go to movies/concerts, explore the city, etc.). And also sex. Sex could definitely be something we do together. :) Like a friend with benefits who's interested in the friend part as well as the benefits.

I want to cook dinner for my love and take care of him in all the ways a man needs a woman to. I want to go for hikes and bike rides together. I just want a simple life in the woods.

The title really says it all. I love to go out and have fun. I like to dance in the middle of the living room and sing out loud. I like bowling, playing board games, star gazing, hiking, camping, sex, watching movies, reading, and I smile and laugh a lot. I have a good life. I am a single mom of a toddler. I work full time and go to school part time. I have my own place and car. I am disease and drug free. That includes pot. I find it more and more difficult to find someone else that does not smoke pot here. 
I am not looking for a one night stand or fwb. I guess I don't really know what I'm doing here. Lol. That all being said, I have found myself slowly falling into depression. Never having any time to meet anyone has made it difficult to make friends, let alone find someone to date. I used to be in pretty good shape, but now I need someone to help me get off the couch again. I enjoy being active when I have someone to be active with. Anyway. . . I guess its Sunday morning now. The Broncos play today. Say hi. . .or don't. Either way, have a good day :-)

Hmmm. Postings in ""men for women"" want cute (isn't cute subjective?), young (okay I get that one), and athletic, petite, HWP, and of course no BBW. So - where does this leave me? I turned 60 on Christmas (am I in the winter of my life?), so I'm not young anymore (unless maybe you are 80?). I think I passed the cute stage many years ago. And, I am not athletic, or HWP. Am I BBW? Not sure about that description, but yes I am overweight. Oh, and even though I've lived here all of my life, I have never liked skiing, and don't Ride the Rockies.

I possess a kind heart and a good sense of humor (if you appreciate sarcasm). I've come out of a divorce and thinking about being with a kind gentleman. Well, wondering if that will ever happen. Divorce recent, but the marriage died many years ago -- that old saying about beating a dead horse. I've gotten over looking for my soul mate, then again never say never. I can be a good listener - I like to hear your stories. I like to talk too -- but will only chat at half time during your football games. 

I don't care about race or have concerns about weight, or other outward appearances. I do think someone that remembers where he was when JFK was assassinated would be of the best age. I have a wonderful job (want to work there for many more years), drive a Buick, and I have a nice place to live. I don't smoke and cannot abide it. I don't imbibe alcohol - if you have a beer now and then (like during the Broncos vs. Pats game today) that's okay, but no drugs (including 420) please. I just don't like mind altering substances.

I like George Jones, Patsy Cline, and Johnny Cash. Also, Janis Joplin, Led Zeppelin, and the Rolling Stones, only to name a few. I like the blues and classical too. Going for walks with my dog is a joy (if you have an unruly dog I can help with that), and movies are fun - my favorites are The Godfather (go figure, I'm really not into violence) and Coming Home. I also like good conversation with good friends. 

If you have a mind (or not) to write to me, please put Nostalgia in the subject line.

To the young of heart.

I am looking for someone 27-45 in age. 
Race does not matter at all.
Someone ambitious about wanting to live a comfortable lifestyle. I indulge in enjoying the fruits of my labor and work very hard and have many goals in life that I am working towards. 

If you don't meet these basics, it's ok! Just don't flag me! :)

I am looking for a long term relationship that leads to marriage. I want to get married sooner than later, and believe I have a different understanding about marriage than most people. I believe it is about choice and commitment. Obviously love, chemistry, attraction, etc play into it. But if I CHOOSE my partner, day in and day out, it is much more meaningful. Even love can fade. That doesn't mean you can't get it back. But marriage is work. I am at a point where I am ready to commit myself to one person for the rest of my life and I am looking for someone who is in the same place in life. 

So about me. I am 31, I have 3 kids (open to more if life and financials are in order), and a business owner. I enjoy wine and fine dining. I am a huge music fanatic, but am pretty picky about my music. I like to hike and bike and be outside and active. I am very much into eating healthy and taking care of my body inside and out. I'm 5'6"" 130 pounds, multi-racial, dark hair, light eyes, I have some tattoos. I love romance and want to have a deep, intimate relationship with my partner. I'm a bit of a hopeless romantic.
I live a relatively normal life. It's always an adventure with 3 boys and a business, but it's pretty normal. I believe in keeping balance in everything that you do. So that keeps me sane. 

Please respond with a picture and some information about yourself. And if this ad is up, I am still looking.

I am tired of games, if you are a player click the back button and keep searching elsewhere.
If you opened this and expect to receive a picture that portraits a magazine girl, keep on searching.
At 40 with children I am far from flawless, my skin is stretched, I am curvy but not big, my butt used to be in better shape as well. I'm really just normal but absolutely NOT ugly.
I'm cynical and often told a bit too negative, but in reality I am just logical and realistic.
In reality I've been burned too many times, my guy picker has been off and I've been paying for it each and every time.
You will need to have a more positive attitude to level things out, need to be completely honest, have patience. If you got hurt coming out of a bad relationship, even better.
I am a heavy user of sarcasm, a smoker, 420 is not for me but I don't mind if you do (better than alcohol)
I am separated, not yet divorced but both my husband and I moved on going out separate ways in agreement (yes really no baggage on this part)

Hi guys. New to downtown and seeing what's out here. I'm sure there's some nice guys somewhere. I'd go into how I'm a size queen and how I like sex. But we'll save that for later. I'm more interested in a man who takes care of his mind as well as his body. One who has good convo. A gentlemen who knows how to treat a lady and isn't a complete cupcake. I like a man with a sexy vioce and you don't get that in a txt. So it would be nice if you were a phone person, but don't talk my head off. I think you get the piont. Respond w a pic and little about yourself. Change the subject line.

Im pretty open minded. Age not a biggie, however got a thing for younger. Must be legal. Open to race and body type. But do like taller; doesn't take much. Im 5'2. Would like ongoing thing if the connection is there. If that's you please respond w a pic. I will do the same. Didn't post my pics here for obvious reasons. 

I am dark skinned. Thick not fat, there's a difference. It's thick butt it's tight. If you can't haddle a little extra in the ass and curves, this ain't for you. Okay with piercings and tattoos. I have several. If you're okay with all you've read; respond. Look forward to meeting you.

P.S Be ready and willing to meet. If this is still up I'm still looking.

Not being very productive this morning, I've been sucked in CL reading both men and women dating ads. 

After sifting out the perverted ads everyone else seems to really be selling themselves as these super nice people, with ridiculous qualities they have or want in a partner. Really who says stuff like that? ""He has to be brave, kind, honest because I'm happy, peaceful and ambitious""???? 

I'll be honest alright, I smoke cigarettes and drink an entire bottle of wine after work every night. Lush/wino? Absolutely!!! I have more clothes thrown all over my bedroom floor than what's actually hanging on the rack because I change about 5 times before I actually choose something. If you are dating me, I'll bug you endlessly before walking out the house asking which outfit looks the best and get pissed off if you don't take it seriously. My makeup and hair products at all times are scattered everywhere in the bathroom, but I will bitch at you if you leave the toilet seat up. 

I spent my college years as a sorority girl, and still party with my girlfriends as if the party never stops. At one point on a good party night I will no doubt end up on the top of the table or on stage to dance, you'll be embarrassed and everyone will be looking at you to go pick me up off the damn table, carry me out of the bar and take my drunk ass home. Your reward will be crazy sloppy drunk sex with me, though at 4am I may be throwing up in the bathroom. This is okay though because I'll be happy to lose the cocktail calories. 

Speaking of calories, I don't cook dinner and hardly ever eat dinner. I drink a protein shakes instead, so never expect me to cook for you or spend time at the dinner table. I am vain vain vain vain, to the point I'll probably never have kids because the idea of ruining my girlish figure is horrifying. Most likely when I'm an old lady I'll be pumped full of Botox too!! The plan is to stay sexy, and thin at all costs! 

When we go to a concert or all day event with friends we'll end up getting into a fight in front of everyone. You'll mostly be bitching at me about flirting with other guys, ignoring you, drinking too much or telling me how you never get the chance to relax because you're always the one having to babysit me. Eventually we'll make up and PDA. Pretty much all our friends will see us as a toxic bipolar relationship. 

Social media, I will annoy the shit out of you by my addicted phone use; texting friends, hash tagging twitter and posting our couple selfies on FB. 

You always wanted a ""independent"" girl, not someone always with you every second of the day. But after we're together this idea will drive you nuts. At one point you'll be questioning your sanity when you do a drive by or check in when I randomly have the habit of going MIA on you. Sometimes I'll announce it's a GNO or girls trip weekend. You'll text and I won't reply, you'll call and I won't return your call. This annoys you because you know I'm attached to my phone. I'll stumble in before the sun comes up and you'll be furious. You'll start thinking I linked up with some dude at the bar and drilling me with questions, I'll be screaming back accusing you of being too controlling and suffocating. Some fights will get out of control with me throwing crap and being my naturally bratty self. Later we'll make up, I will use sex as a control tool to get you to stay. Then for a few weeks I'll be on my ""best behavior"", but it never lasts long. I'm caring but selfish, smart but immature. You'll see I grew up pampered and have sense of entitlement that you'll pet name me Brat for. You will admit my good qualities may be far from the Mother Theresa type but find I don't cheat, don't abuse the credit card and care about my looks, so your standards will sway a bit. 

The idea of taking me as your date to a family wedding, company picnic or holiday party will terrify you. Sure I look terrific and at first act just the lady my dear Mother raised, but you'll find yourself sweating underneath your collar as you start counting up the times I visit the open bar. Then bam it happens, I start stumbling and just called your bosses wife by a different name. I'll talk a little bit louder and start cracking totally inappropriate jokes. Absolutely no peace for you! So yup, that's me in a nutshell. Couldn't even make this shit up if I tried.

Who's up for a date now? Lol

I doubt I'll find a sane guy here but let's be an optimist.

I'm a hopeless romantic, but let's be honest love is the hardest thing to find now a days. It's like winning the lottery. I find it odd, that relationships I look up to doesn't exist anymore. I like small things... I don't want the world, or to take over the world, or even be someone's world... But I just want to face the world with someone with me, by my side. Some nights are cold, lonely and down right depressing (thoughts filling through my mind) but it would be great to have someone heart beat to listen to, to talk to, to cuddle with. I don't want sex, that is so easy. But I want a connection. Instead I want a connection, meaning, emotional raw relationship.

I'm an intellectual girl. I consider myself 50% extrovert, 50% introvert. I don't bullshit, I say what I feel. That way I won't regret it. If you don't agree, at least we both know I was being real and honest. I love raw conversations, sleepless nights, adventures, poetry, food, movies, art, I adore life. Life is beautiful. I see things in a positive light, at all times. I adore leaves, trees, the wind. I love the cold, I love chai, I love being outside with chai when it is freezing with snow falls. The smaller things in life make me happy. I go to school fulltime. I love gaining knowledge and knowing that I'm developing into a better person, daily... I love working out, going on adventures, hiking, running, anything as long as I'm with the right people or right person... I will not tolerate assholes, settlers, and negative people. Life is short to set yourself into a direction of darkness. I won't let someone sink me down. I love to live, and live to love. Leave the hate at the door. If you're scared of real, don't even message me. If you read the whole thing, message me a paragraph about yourself with a picture! Good luck. 


You should send a picture.
You should ABOUT me.
Please be COLLEGE educated or in college

Hello. I am a single white woman seeking a single white man, 60ish or older please. I am an educated woman with many positive attributes such as a great personality, a love of life and family and God, I have solid core values, live in a lovely community (I own my home), and generally lead a very good life. I have been alone for quite some time, so I am of the belief it is time to get out there and see if I can rustle up a good man. Is that you? My children are all grown and out of the nest and there is nothing holding me back at this point in my life. I enjoy the arts; theatre, opera, concerts, museums and plays. I have done quite a bit of traveling over the years, and I would like to plan a trip to Italy in 2016. I enjoy board games, and can play poker pretty well, although I have yet to sit at a card table in Black Hawk or Central City. (My father was a professional poker back in the day). I have long brown hair with lots of highlights, brown eyes, red lips, red finger nails and red toe nails...lolol. I am able to dress it up, or knock around in a pair of jeans, although I prefer dressing up (awww, when I was a little girl I dreamed of being a ""pretty lady""). Rather than bore you with all my sterling attributes, why not contact me and share yourself and who you are, your age, ethnicuty, are you single and who knows? Maybe we will click. Oh, by the way, I am not hard on the eyes. Thanks for your time, and have a great holiday!

I don't want to jump into a LTR. I like options. The more I get to know you, the more I learn in what capacity I want you in my life. I'd like you to be open to options, too. (Besides a casual/sex relationship - that's the one option I won't entertain).

About me : I'm 30 and pretty. If you're looking for more physical details then maybe we're not looking for the same thing. 

I have a good career and am pursuing a graduate degree. I have a license, car, home.

I very much dislike people who don't respect others' feelings. If you call women crazy or bitches - we won't get along.

Hey I'm brandy :) I'm 26 years old. Bigger girl I guess curvy? I work as a teacher in a classroom with young pre schoolers. I love my job and have found my calling. I am still missing that special person to enjoy my free time with. 

I enjoy traveling and escaping on the weekends, especially to the ocean. I love to cuddle up to a great book when its rainy out but also love to go camping, hiking, And enjoy the sun as much as I can.

Although my friends say I have a knack for talking my head off, they very much enjoy the banter. I'm in touch with my emotions, and normally have a unique and thoughtful view on things!

My Qualities

so here goes:
I'm physically a curvy girl, but I'm working on getting in better shape and taking better care of my body. I'm pretty much an extrovert, i love talking, laughing, and being silly. I love an adventure, especially if it involves the ocean. 

I Love...

Adventures 
Traveling
Food 
My family and friends
My pup
Ncis ,law and order, criminal minds
Reading


What I'm Looking For...

I'm looking for a gentleman at heart. Someone to share my life and adventures with. Lately I've realized that having adventures with someone is much more thrilling than having them all alone. I want someone under 38, drug and disease free, and who is happy with his life just wanted someone to spend it with!! So if you can relate to any of the above, and if you share a few qualities with me, then contact me. Looking forward to heariNg from you soon!

Hello!! This is a longshot, but here it goes. I'm looking for someone who has the same interests as I have. I enjoy camping. Movies, cooking, football, hockey, Nascar, going for a drive together, or just watching a movie at home, if any of these sound like you get back to me.

Twenty six year old brunette female seeking like minded, nerdy boyfriendish type person. I'm a single (divorced) mom. I'm a trekkie and a fan girl (so you've got your work cut out for you), love all sorts of music (even write and sing some of my own), and I'm a DVD collector. I have a culinary degree. I work full time (I adult and everything). I like dogs, and have a pit/boxer mix named Obi-Wan, though, he sadly doesn't live with me right now (I miss him). I'm quirky, I randomly burst into song, and I love coffee. Interested? Email me your photo. No dirty pictures, please! I am a lady, and expect to be treated as such! I'll send you a picture in return.Would you like for me to spice up your night? Lets go out to dinner and lets have a great time. I have went on a few dates but I felt not only something was missing but also my time being wasted. Have you ever felt that way before? Would you like to meet a woman who is exciting and that you hit it off with mutually?

""Still waters run deep. Just remember when we lie to each other. No one wins and losers weep. Reflections will show disconnection. We can lean on each other. This is all we need to know"" 

I happen to have those song lyrics stuck in my head at the moment. If you feel you can relate to them we have much to discuss. About me: I'm a crazed musician, grounded caregiver aimless wanderer and writer of lists. I am open to getting to know any genuine person and all the surface qualities while interesting and at times eye catching are just that. I am in search of a deeper connection, whatever that may be. It'seems hard to describe myself with any true objectivity so get to know me and judge for yourself. Growing up was usually seen as oart wall flower and part class clown which led me to be the introverted goofball I am today. ""Goofball"" doesn'the strike me as a word that people usually seriously type out but i fuess i just did. Anyway, Merry February! No one ever Saya that anymore. Especially not in August. I look forward to hearing from you!

I have a history in truck driving as a rider. I had a couple friends in the past that I rode with and I was in a serious relationship for a year with one. I have many friends on fb from many states, one retired, that have or are driving otr. I've been off the road a year and it's been that long since I've been in a relationship. I've been to every state and I rode fulltime 30 days to three months at a time, I've always felt that it was just like camping. I can cook on a truck and that definitely took some imagination and joining some groups for cooking otr but, it was definitely a great lifestyle most can't even think of living because it's not always easy and it is a big test on two people. I made a comment once that all couples looking to get married should have to spend at least a week or two in a semi otr and I'd bet 99% wouldn't be together afterwards.

I miss it like I miss breathing and I would like to find a man who is a trucker. I am not looking for a one time pleasure or anything of that sort. I have a good sense of humor and I always try to make the best out of every situation, I am a clean and somewhat quiet person but, I know what it means to compensate for the other in making time pass and interesting.

To be sent to Earth with no purpose only to find you waiting with no expectations, a broken wing, and a shattered soul. . ..You are my purpose, my fading star to which I am gifted so that you may return to heaven and fly once more. But how to minister to thy wounds so deep? Shall I wash them with my tears and watch you rise like a phoenix from ashes? Or shower you with dew from the gods, dry you with the threads of the universe, and mend your broken wing with pieces of my own fate woven by those fated sisters three? Oh, Dark Angel, let me minister to thy needs and cater to thy whims, for you are my eternal purpose in this dying world and dreadful existence. 
You are my song. Every verse is a new page added to my existence, to my very being. Listen to the lyre, harp, flute, and cymbals. . .. They sing of grace, tragedy great, and a rugged beauty beyond compare. Every angel, demon, and gods alike stand in awe of the truth that is you. Time has stopped to exist because every living thing weeps with you. Your tears fall and mother earth ushers them to the rivers and oceans, giving life, water, and nourishment to those who need it. The words you speak are manna to my ears, giving me life where none was. How is that you, my dark angel, have become my savior? When did the tides turn and rise to drown me in the sea of your love? Rise my warrior and take to the skies. Heaven has called and needs you once again. Take my halo from my head to wear upon your brow for there are those who seek to call you fallen and take your place in battle. This halo of mine contains my life and with it I must give all that inside me so that finally you may live. 
And I become the broken and fallen one to whom heaven has no need.

I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing here, but I'm relatively certain this isn't the way to do it. Oh well, hurts no one, costs nothing. I've realized a few things over the past year or so. First, I have a hard time with compromising. Apparently I do have a type. Or, more correctly, I have a list of attributes I can't do. And second, because of my choice of career and its location, I've essentially isolated myself from people. 2 for 2. 

I am a huge science nerd. But I've never quite fit into that world completely, because I've also got a flare for the dramatic. Love witty banter, sarcasm, laugh easily. I can be extremely intense at times. Brain doesn't shut off, often to my detriment. There is no factory reset button, I've looked. I absorb information like a Shamwow. I tend to attract similar. Never married, no kids.

Love art, music, theater, photography. Hiking, road trips anywhere, heated discussion, good whiskey. And I'm not bragging or anything, but Freddy Mercury might be my biological father.

What can one say about someone like me? I have tried to break it down and it inevitably becomes lengthy. So be prepared.

I am in my early thirties, I am short by many many standards and my body type is: I've had a kid, surgeries for health issues, and I've lost like 80 lbs. A woman's body who has endured a lot and still fancies decorating it colorful tattoos and odd style clothes and an even odder personality. A beautiful disaster. I am very sexual, however fragile, and of sexuality, I am whatever I guess. I can find either gender attractive at times. Art, music, and venturing on the unknown fuel me. I am an artist. Music is my strongest antidepressant I've found, though I admit I struggle with depression but I do take care of it. (no one's perfect bro.) The unknown can be so many things and nothing all at once. I am 420 friendly, she's my best ""buddy"". Mind expanding, blowing, giggling and watching things that normally are insignificant times are also important to me too. It's lovely to experience that with someone you love. I am educated and my mind is interesting to pick. I have many views and I enjoy learning other's views as well. Just don't try to convince me you're right over me. We are all entitled to our own opinion. I do not believe in organized religion. I have studied it, and it isn't for me. I don't want to be with someone that's hardcore anything. Just do your own thing. I do mine and that's all that is needed for me. I am a talker when I find information that is interesting, so if you are close minded, please move on. I live a lonely little life. My kid doesn't live with me but I love her more than anything. I have been truly single since November and I am so tired of the crap, the drama, the lies, the weirdness, the heartache, the tears and ache of losing that person I loved more than he deserved. I don't find being and living alone great. It's hard on me. I crave affection and love like a drug. I've been in long term relationships since I was 15 and just find it too much on my heart to be alone any longer. I am physically unable to have more children but I do enjoy kids. I raised my daughter to be a wonderful young lady and now her dad is taking a turn. 

So what do I want? Well... I have dated younger men most my life, and where am I now? Alone... why? Well, you can't force someone to be with you if you aren't their perfect love. And the men that were younger; I really gave my heart to them and they left me behind, so I am reluctant to be with anyone a lot younger than me again. It's not something I can endure right now; being abandoned again. But if you can prove you are real and can handle yourself and are mature then I will think about it. But I think I should be with an older man or same age. (I can't give you kids, would that even be fair for a younger man to give up that experience, for me? I don't think so. It would hurt my heart). But who knows. (late twenties to late forties is acceptable as long as you aren't a POS haha.) Come what may. Don't be afraid to love, my heart falls way fast and don't be scared if yours does too. I do not want someone jealous and controlling. I can tell immediately if that's the case after meeting you and I have a tendency to use colorful language to tell others what I think about that. I am sarcastic and I will make fun of you so you better just get used to it. But know if I do it a lot, then I care. I am more attracted to thinner, taller than me, white or lighter men. I know, blah, hate me, it's just my preference. My kid is half puerto rican, so if YOU have issues with race, move on. Okay, let me just sum this up since I am having issues paying attention to writing and am just singing along to music and falling over a lot bc I really love certain songs and I get over zealous swaying to the music haha, whatever. YOU: Loving, caring, not jealous, honest, taller than little me, thinner or HWP at least, open minded, love music, willing to learn about depression and how it affects a woman like me, willing to love someone that needs a strong person to hold her on her bad days; meaning you. Accepting that I have had some health issues and lots of outside and strenuous activity makes me physically ill. Not that IDW to do those things, it's that I can't really. But it's a trial and error process so have patience, I will try at least once. (But don't leave me behind, because when I do catch up, I will flick you so hard in the throat... pinky swear.) I need you to understand that my very best friend right now in the world is a straight man and yes I did date him once, but he is all I've had for a while and I will never give him up for anyone. He is there for me all the time and I love him to death. We aren't a thing but I tell him everything and we pity party ourselves being alone once in a while. (He wouldn't admit it... if you read this you do too, so shhhhhhhhhhhh-tfu lol xoxo) I want to fall in love. I want to love and be loved and not looked down upon but sought after to learn from and questioned to understand me. I do the same. I am the most giving and thoughtful person in the world. Even the person that left me in November said he had never met someone like me in that aspect. It makes him feel bad for leaving me sometimes haha. Oh well. /shrug. 

If you got through all this, congrats, you have no life, like me, and that's okay! Just kidding. Reply with a picture. If you can't or won't after one request, then just don't bother. 

Yes I am real, The Walking Dead is on tonight and if you were here watching it too and spoke while it's on, I'd kick you out lol. So if you like things like that, cool! Dr Who, Goth Music, Melodic Metal, GoT, Penny Dreadful, FaceOff, Z Nation, anything vampires, scary movies, zombies, Rob zombie movies, (and his wife is hot, whatever.) Interview with the Vampire, 28 days later, etc... some of my faves.

It seems a shame that some posters do not have the decency to allow others the same privileges they take for themselves. Blocking (prohibited tag) denies others on the basis of singular perceptions, which if you're found out will get the same response. A good hacker can find you (sic).

It might sound desperate to see a girl wanting to go from one relationship to the next, but in my mind, I've been single for years and ready to find a guy to be with.

I'm not looking to meet right away for my own safety and also not desperate to jump into any relationship.
I also have two kids so patience is key here for me.

Preferably just taking it slow and see where it takes us.

Things I'm looking for with my current situation:
Friendly conversations
Occasional lunch dates
and obviously hook up... lol
still be exclusive/committed to one another


What I look for in a guy:
- Respectable
- Responsible
- Athletic/fit: someone who is disciplined enough to take care of himself
- adventurous and outdoorsy but also laid back enough to have fun at home
- outgoing as I am more shy and quiet
- Fun and goofy
- The general: sweet, thoughtful, caring, romantic
- high sex drive.. keep up with me :P
- Ambitious
- Older than me: 28-33

A little about me:
- Shy and quiet but just as weird and awkward.. lol
- I'm all over the place right now with my life goals/career but I'm narrowing it down (so I'm also really busy right now)
- I like to be outside
- I'm short and chubby (but hopefully fit and strong soon)
- 26 years old

I really don't know what else to share haha
I'm uniquely me.. simple but complicated..haha

A man who realizes that taking care of himself is important. A man who wants to be with just one woman. A man who is truly ready for a relationship, realizing it takes time to get to know someone... truly know them.

This is an ad looking for a long term relationship. If you are looking for anything less, you should be looking under casual encounters. 

Craigslist is entertaining to say the least. Who knew that meeting someone of quality was so difficult.

I think it would be fun to find someone to share Craigslist horror stories ( I have a bunch). 

I do enjoy many different things: such as camping, going for walks, long talks, concerts, dancing, star gazing, watching movies, gardening and many other things.

I thought I'd give this a try and see where it takes me. 

A little bit about myself -- I am a very creative and compassionate person. I enjoy helping others as best as I can. I'm a great listener and very empathetic. In my free time, I love to draw, read, and write. I am hoping that one day I will be able to publish books of my own. I'm a bit of a nerd -- I love D&D and I do play video games (Primarily Xbox, and primarily RPGs). I moved to Colorado a few months ago and have fallen in love with the mountains and all the city has to offer. The Botanic Gardens has become one of my favorite haunts. I love touch -- even platonic touch. I love giving hugs, I love holding hands -- and in a more romantic setting, I love kisses, cuddling, general affection, and of course intimacy. I mention that because I know that some people prefer not to be touched or it makes them feel crowded where as I am the opposite of that. 

I like to try and be a better version of myself than I was the day before every day. I want to experience all that life has to offer. I enjoy traveling and seeing new places for that reason. I have a list of all the places I want to see in my lifetime! My body type is currently a bit above average - I say currently, because I have been striving to get healthier after watching my parents go through so many health complications, and so I've actually lost about 30lbs in the past five months alone. I only mention this because I do understand that some do like a particular body type - if I am not your type, please do not email me if this would be an issue for you. I also value uniqueness; I think everyone should be their own person without worrying what another person might think. I've had my hair all sorts of colors in the past, I have two lip piercings, and I do have one tattoo with plans of getting more. I love good tattoos and I love piercings. I love it when someone isn't afraid to be themselves. I am not religious, but I don't mind religion so long as it isn't shoved down my throat. I am happy knowing that everyone has their own unique beliefs. I do drink socially, I don't really care for smoking pot, but I have eaten a few edibles that were not bad. I don't smoke cigarettes, but I do enjoy hookah. 

I am twenty six years old and I am looking for someone between the ages of twenty two and thirty six. That number can be edged a little in either direction, but not by a great amount. I am looking for someone who is responsible -- someone who has their own place or has a place with roommates, etc. Basically, you do not live in your parent's basement, unless of course there is a good reason for it. I do know some people who did remain with their parents for longer, but for good reason. Just be a responsible adult! Haha =) I am looking for someone who is honest and trustworthy because I feel that is the basis of a relationship. I am not looking for anyone who is currently with anyone else -- I am not that person, and you should not be either. Hoping to find someone who does share some common interests with me, but opposites do attract, and I am open minded to trying new things as well! 

Your picture gets mine! Please, no nudes. I'd like to get to know you first. I am not looking for a hook up. Include some of your hobbies or a little bit about yourself -- be unique in your writing! Stand apart from the rest. Don't send me two liner emails. I actually have today and Monday off of work so we could potentially meet up and hang out somewhere.

Long shot. In the midst of superficial ads, I am not just looking for a real person. I am looking for at least an equal: educated, intelligent, attractive, self actualized and wholesome man.

I do not need saving; that means I have my life together. I appreciate style, wit, sarcasm, wine&dine, museums, theater, live music shows, nature and all its beauty, class. 

Any gentleman appreciating the same?

My only interest is a long term relationship, a family and children one day.

I'm just a 25 year old lady looking to date and eventually settle down. Yes I'm big, but I'm working on that, I wanna be a healthy fit person in the long run. I care more about having a strong, deep and emotional connection. Looks aren't as important to me, but personality is.

I'm such a sweet, nice, kind and caring person. I'm not mean spirited, I promise. I've been single for a couple years now and I'm not gonna lie I miss having someone to cuddle with, share my hopes and ambitions with and companionship. I'm the kind of girl your mom would adore, seriously! 

I love going out to bars/clubs once or twice a month, I like staying in too. I enjoy cooking, watching movies, listening to music. I don't smoke cigarettes or pot but I do enjoy hookah, I don't care if you smoke pot, I just can't stand cigarettes for a reason lol. I'm super girly and I love trying new things as well.

My posting has been up a short while and I already have to edit... Please, I am not looking for a one night stand. Do not send dirty pics. Also, I would prefer to find someone that has weekends off so that we can do things together. 


Why do we make dating harder than it really is? Is it wrong to just grab dinner or a coffee and talk? Why is there so much pressure for it to go perfect? So, you may not be attracted to that person when you meet, but why does that mean you can't have a good evening? Two adults should be able to talk and have a good time without all the prejudice that comes along. With that being said, I am looking for someone who is mature, stable, outgoing and well rounded. I know this is Craigslist, but I know there are good men out there. It feels like we have to put warning labels on our ads these days. I should not have to say that I am looking for someone that is single. If you are not single, you should not be looking. If you have a STD, go on a STD dating site.. It seems simple, but people do not get it.

I Have a career

This is an ad looking for a long term relationship. If you are looking for anything less, you should be looking under casual encounters. 

Craigslist is entertaining to say the least. Who knew that meeting someone of quality was so difficult.

So, Saturday night and I am at home watching the hockey game. At least it is something to watch. I do enjoy most sports. 

I think it would be fun to find someone to share Craigslist horror stories ( I have a bunch). 

I do enjoy many different things: such as camping, going for walks, long talks, concerts, dancing, star gazing, watching movies, gardening and many other things. 

I would like to find someone 35-50, employed, stable and ready to have a serious relationship.

My body type is currently a bit above average - I say currently, because I have been striving to get healthier after watching my parents go through so many health complications, and so I've actually lost about 30lbs in the past five months alone. I only mention this because I do understand that some do like a particular body type - if I am not your type, please do not email me if this would be an issue for you. I also value uniqueness; I think everyone should be their own person without worrying what another person might think. I've had my hair all sorts of colors in the past, I have two lip piercings, and I do have one tattoo with plans of getting more. I love good tattoos and I love piercings. I love it when someone isn't afraid to be themselves. I am not religious, but I don't mind religion so long as it isn't shoved down my throat. I am happy knowing that everyone has their own unique beliefs. I do drink socially, I don't really care for smoking pot, but I have eaten a few edibles that were not bad. I don't smoke cigarettes, but I do enjoy hookah.

I am twenty six years old and I am looking for someone between the ages of twenty two and thirty six. That number can be edged a little in either direction, but not by a great amount. I am looking for someone who is responsible -- someone who has their own place or has a place with roommates, etc. Basically, you do not live in your parent's basement, unless of course there is a good reason for it. I do know some people who did remain with their parents for longer, but for good reason. Just be a responsible adult! Haha =) I am looking for someone who is honest and trustworthy because I feel that is the basis of a relationship. I am not looking for anyone who is currently with anyone else -- I am not that person, and you should not be either. Hoping to find someone who does share some common interests with me, but opposites do attract, and I am open minded to trying new things as well!

Your picture gets mine! Please, no nudes. I'd like to get to know you first. I am not looking for a hook up. Include some of your hobbies or a little bit about yourself -- be unique in your writing! Stand apart from the rest. Don't send me two liner emails. I actually have today and Monday off of work so we could potentially meet up and hang out somewhere.

Anyone up for some witty banter during that time? Well, let's be honest, after my 3rd glass of wine and 900pm rolls around, the banter will just be me bitchy about stupidness.

About me (so you can direct your questions accordingly). I am divorced (relatively recently). I am 34. I am happy.

I am in great great great shape. I am a [solidcore] fiend. I'm tall (sorry) 5'7 and do keep it very toned. But I also love to eat out and travel. I love new experiences and trying different things. I am incredibly open minded and tolerant of everyone.

I love going to the theater and concerts and have many subscriptions. I love getting dressed up. But don't mind a night at home for some board games and wine.

Basically, if I'm going out, I like to do something a tad more adult. But if I'm staying in, it's PJs, board games and going to bed early.

If you want to know anything else, just ask. I'm pretty easy to speak with. If I don't get to your response and it is good, there's a pretty good chance I get to it tomorrow (as i'll be a zombie and my boss isn't in the office).

I am starting to get spring fever over here. I would love to find a kind man to spend my time with. 

I am a rather simple woman and the it's the simple things that make me happy. I like hanging out and getting to know each other. It does not have to be anything fancy. Maybe a drink on the patio, a movie to cuddle too, a warm fireplace? I also enjoy being outdoors. There are so many things to see and do in Colorado and it would be nice to find someone to share those times with. 

I am not into games or drama. Please save that for T.V. I have my life in order and I am just missing that special someone to share it with. 

If you would like to chat more, let's talk and see where it goes. Maybe we can get together this weekend?

First off, I am a single mom *not* looking to replace my child's father. I'm independent and don't need anyone's help to survive. I'm already doing it on my own. That said, I do have split custody so I do have free time every now and then. Every now and then being the key words so don't waste my time if you want to play games. 

Now ...what do I want? I've been single for awhile now. I've dated but nothing that has really peaked my interest. I'm looking for a man between the ages of 26-35 who has his shit together. This means he can pass a background check (I won't be doing one but this is standard to have any job), intelligent, assertive, honest, and most importantly, funny! I love someone who I can be myself with and while I'm serious about what I'm looking for, my personality is laid back. I make really stupid jokes and say things like ""that's what she said"". 

I don't want to rush into anything and will never get married again. Unless I find someone super amazing...then I'll reconsider. I don't want anymore children. I have one and that's enough for me. If you have kids, that's okay. As far as looks are concerned: I'm not attracted to heavier men. A few pounds to lose? That's fine, so do I. Race isn't an issue and neither is hair/eye color although I am a sucker for dark hair....just saying. 

Either way, reply to my post. You never know! Change the subject to ""that's what she said"" so I know you are paying attention. Replies with pictures will move to the top of the list. And please, keep your dick in your pants. No one wants to see that before they even get a chance to see your handsome face. 

Almost forgot--be single!!! 100% single. No exceptions.

I hope my post finds you well. A lot of people consider Craigslist not the best site to meet good/kind/honest people. But I want to believe in the opposite. i'm a professional and I believe my life is great. I have wonderful and supporting friends. But I don't think that my life is fulfilling. One of my friends says, ""We have body, mind and soul. Body needs food, mind needs thoughts, and soul needs another soul."" I think it is aprofound statement. My body and mind are fine, but my soul needs another soul. I am looking for a true relationship which leads to commitment and marriage. I am not in the stage to play around and waste my life.

Nature of the relationshipEdit

Sexual slavery is a consensualexchange of power by the submissive to the dominant, though the scope of the surrender of discretion may be limited and may be withdrawn at any time.

The types of activities that the sex slave may be expected to perform are usually defined in advance and sometimes spelled out in a slave contract, a document that outlines the desires, limits, and expectations of the parties. The sex slave is often expected to perform sexually, though typically many relationship-oriented dynamics are also clearly negotiated, including clothing, diet, speech restrictions, household affairs and schedules, though the details may be left to the master or mistress. Typically outlined are clear expectations of whether the couple will be monogamous or polyamorous, and if there would be permission or expectation of sexual interaction with other people. Otherwise, a sex slave may be expected to perform many of the same functions that are expected of a slave/submissive, including wearing very revealing clothes, being shared, wearing a slave collar or leash, S&M activities, or bondage.[3]

A Master & slave relationship is normally a long-term relationship, comparable in duration to 'normal relationships' whereas a Dominant - submissive relationship could be of a similar duration or shorter from a few minutes, as in a scene. Depending on their contract, a sex slave may be traded by the master, facilitated by sex club events, personals in BDSM interest magazines or internet based social networks.[4] Commonly, a slave is also said to be a collared slave, though not every slave wears a physical slave collar.

A slave who has satisfied the duration of the negotiated time of service is expected to be released, unless a new duration of service is negotiated. A slave may at any time withdraw consent to the relationship; effectively nullifying the slave relationship.

I miss the lazy nights on the couch, cuddling, watching TV after our long days at work. Your wonderful cooking!
I miss the cuddling all night while we both sleep. Your ever so genital love making!!! 
The fun and laughter we shared all the time. I dont ever remember us fighting. The most perfect 9 months of my life!!
Our weekends at the property, riding four wheelers. Sitting by the campfire. Giving you kisses on your sweaty neck and head while you cursed at replacing carpet and tile in the camper. The rides on your Harley! You still owe me!!
Our kids having fun together. Taking them to paint pottery, to Disney on Ice, to the Flea Market... Teaching your son how to make a Bow out of a stick and string...
Shooting nurf guns!! Spending time with your daughter, who was only here for part of the summer...
You scared me when you told me you loved me after being together for 8 months, I didnt think I was ready. I realized not long after that I did love you too... But it was too late... I have dated others, but its just not the same. Seems like everything I do, reminds me of you!!
Please I'd love to give it another chance.

I do want someone to smoke with tonight, I have a little bit to pitch. I'm a standard geeky punk style girl, I listen to alternative style music but adore other genres as well. I'm willing to trade a picture for a picture as well so you know I'm not someone weird. 
I adore art, and genuinely love food haha.
If you're interested don't hesitate to talk to me about maybe coming to pick me up tonight and see where it goes! :) Also, my name is Jenny.

A little about me. I'm 23 years old. I'm 5'10"" so I prefer someone taller than me.
I work full time and going to school part time. I'm a little shy at first but I open up pretty fast. 
I am a true believer in kindness. I love to meet someone who is kind as well but can stand up for themselves.

Let's be honest here. What the hell kind of nickname is that? When I watched him in his little argyle sweater priss across a stage I knew right then he was unelectable on a national level. It wasn't his stupid ass 47% comment or his taxes or any of that. People want a leader they can relate to. Who the devil could relate with him. Trump on the other hand could be my uncle or guy next door as far as relatable goes . Shame on you mittens. I think your eyes are green with envy at the Don. Trump is a good guy and manly as well as an accomplished business man known world wide. It's true, when Trump speaks people listen. We know he is not a politician and that's why we love and respect him. How many politicians can say that? We all know Trump will be our next president, any moran can see that.

Like most things, there are pros and cons to dating. Sometimes it may seem like a necessary evil on the road to finding love (and it is), but that doesn't mean you don't sometimes want to throw your hands up in the air and say, ""forget it! I'd rather be single for life."" The planning, the getting your hopes up about a new guy, the being disappointed, the feeling like there are no decent guys left in the world, we've all been there. They do say you'll find the One when you stop looking, so maybe it's time we just put that little piece of dating wisdom to the test.

1. Guys who'd rather text forever than make solid plans. What is he waiting for? Does he need a hand written invitation in order to hang out with you in person? Even worse when you take a chance and ask him out, and he still can't seem to commit to anything.

2. When you find out he already has a girlfriend. But we had such a connection, what do you mean he's not single? Why would he flirt with me like that then?!

3. When your friend meets her soul mate after being on OKCupid for literally 24 hours. How is it that you could scour that site for weeks and barely scrape together a couple dates, and she finds the Chris Pratt in the online dating rough without even having a photo up?!

4. When he invites you out and then ""forgets"" his wallet. Look, we have no problem paying for our half, but when it's clear he had no intention of paying at all, we have to consider sneaking out through the bathroom window, and leaving him to wash dishes to pay off his debt.

5. When his idea of a date is bringing his entire entourage to meet you at a bar at midnight. A date shouldn't involve him making sure his wing man has a shot with one of your friends.

6. When you think it's going well and he freaks out because you left a spare tampon in his bathroom. Or worse, when he accuses you of leaving it there, but it was actually his roommate's girlfriend.

7. The third time you break up with the same person. Somehow it seemed more productive to revive an old relationship than find someone new. You were wrong. Twice. Dating is just too much work.

8. When you can't seem to get past the first date, ever. Even when it seems like the first date was fantastic, somehow planning the second date becomes harder than trying to schedule brunch with Beyonce.

9. The unsolicited dick pic. Once second you were innocently talking about the third season of House of Cards, and the next, there's a dick on your phone.

10. Watching your friend go through a bad breakup. If you start dating someone, there's a pretty good chance that crying mess on the couch eating an entire bag of Smart Food dipped in peanut butter will be you in the foreseeable future.

11. Coffee dates. Unless you're going on dates at 9am, caffeine is ill advised. No one wants to put any effort into first dates anymore, meaning you end up drinking way more lattes than you should be, and every date becomes pretty dull and repetitive.

12. When he looks nothing like his picture. The question is, do you call him on it, or do you force a polite smile, chug that latte, and get out of there asap?

13. When he leaves you with the bill because you didn't want to hook up. This guy doesn't even pretend he forgot his wallet. He just doesn't come back from the bathroom. So that's why he chose the corner booth with no view of the door.

14. Finding out he's a racist, homophobic, pro-life, misogynistic actual crazy person. It's official, there are no nice, normal guys left. You can end the search now.

15. When staying home in your pjs is more appealing than going out. You could go on another date with this guy, or that guy, but why bother? At least your cat doesn't have uncontrollable gas or make you watch UFC. Once you realize the gloriousness of being single, there isn't much short of a millionaire who looks like David Beckham that will convince you to go on a date ever again. At least for now.

Hello,

To start out I am 31 years old. I am a mother to 2 boys and share custody 50/50 with their father! I work full time and go to school part time. 

I am a fun loving woman with a sarcastic, spunky personality! I am not looking for someone to screw around with. I am looking for a friend and lets see what happens next. I am confident in my own skin, I have had 2 kids, I am not tiny but I am healthy. I am active and love to stay active. I am a woman who knows what she wants and normally go for it. I love to laugh (who doesn't), I love to enjoy a beer or a few. Love hanging out with my friends and family. My kids are my life but I love to enjoy me time also. I love to be outside, hiking, fishing, four wheeling, camping, ANYTHING really!! I am not down for drama but I am a woman after all and tend to embrace my emotions. One thing with me, you will never be guessing where you stand. I do have some ink but definitely looking to get more! Music is my outlet! I am more a country girl but I am always up for new music. I am not looking for a baby daddy, my ex husband and I get along really well. I adore his girlfriend and we are really close friends. 

What I look for in a guy? I look for someone who is into the same things I am. I am looking for a bit of a bad boy with good boy qualities... meaning I want someone who will be respectful in public and show affection but isn't afraid to own his wild side too! I don't have a certain type! I have dated all types of guys, it's about the connection. If you can make me smile and understand my spunky personality then we will get along just fine!! 

I understand this isn't the best way of finding someone but I am a woman. I don't want to be your other woman because your wife or girlfriend just aren't doing it for you, I am a pretty amazing woman and I know what I deserve. I don't need to see your dick, or be asked nasty questions because although I can have fun I am not trashy! I am a mother, woman and want to find someone to laugh with and have fun with!! 

I will send you a picture once you have sent me one. 


If I sound interesting, hit me up!

I'm in my 30s, professionally employed, tall, BBW, fat, large, whatever you call it, no children or emotional bagged. I've had a few long term relationships and am looking for another. I know my body type isn't for everyone and am not looking to dupe anyone, so it's out there. That being said, I've been found attractive before and looking to see what's on craigslist. I've known a few people who've met some nice men here and I was successful many years ago here - we almost married - although it looks like things have changed a bit. I love my job and work too much and hope I can find someone to spend time with evenings and weekends. I enjoy hiking, camping, music, reading, cooking, traveling, and movies.

Dating is difficult, especially as you get older. I am here sincerely looking to meet someone that I can connect with. I'm over being single. It's boring and monotonous. I want someone who is genuinely looking for the same thing as I am.

I need someone who is expressive, and passionate. Someone who enjoys life and enjoys being in love. Someone romantic and exciting and fun. I want a guy who knows how to just live life, and is capable of a real conversation. I miss intimacy and romance. I miss having someone to talk to and laugh with. I miss cuddling. I want a guy who can't wait to see me...it's pretty simple really. I'm not clingy, I don't have any psycho exes, no major baggage, never been married, no kids.

I'm seeking a good looking, sweet, and INTELLIGENT guy, around my age. Please send a picture and I will be glad to send one of mine back. Also, please put ""ALIVE"" in the subject line so that I know you are a real person.

I know this is a total crap shoot but I still hold on to a thread of hope that there is someone out there who is looking for a real relationship. I'm not interested in casual sex. I AM interested in a man who is intelligent, available, attractive, passionate, and has their act together between the ages of 35 and 48. I'm looking for a man who knows the meaning of commitment and is also seeking a true partner in this journey called life. Oh, and NO MARRIED MEN!! I find intelligence sexy and I promise I can match your expectation as well.

A little about me; I describe myself with the following adjectives, as I am sure everybody else does as well; intelligent, funny, attractive (but I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder), inquisitive, spontaneous, jokester, practical, adventurer, realistic dreamer, independent, self sufficient, great co-pilot, loyal, trustworthy, passionate, loving, middle level maintenance (LOL), no drama, laid back yet take charge when necessary type of gal with a plethora of useless knowledge to back it up! I am a BBW and comfortable in my own skin and full of confidence.

Some things I enjoy are; live music, art galleries, coffee over beer, world politics and events, deep insightful conversations and sharing thoughts and ideas without judging or condemning. I enjoy spending time at home, but also enjoy spending time in the great outdoors and all the things Denver has to offer its residents. I also like movies, reading, walks in the park, traveling (whether it be to a small weekend getaway close to home or half way across the country) board games, inside jokes between friends, and all animals! I enjoy cooking for someone else but not for myself! Family is important to me, though I no longer have any. I like children and respect my elders. I will not be having children in this lifetime so hopefully you have already addressed that or you share my desire not to have children.

If any of this has sparked your interest, please don't stop now. Send me an e-mail (and it would be great if you included a pic, I will return the favor). Let me know what you're looking for and what qualities your 'partner in crime' should possess. I am looking to compliment someone, not complicate!

I am a female. I thought I would read the posts here on Craigslist to get idea's for an ad. It quickly became apparent to me that you tender souls sit down and write in one of three categories.

The first is from women that have a 'dream man'. You describe him in great detail. Handsome, great dancer, loves kids, can do everything around the house, etc. Ladies, there is only one problem with this. You created a dream, now you are advertising to fill that dream. Tell me, how is that working for you? Be honest. Fantasies are fun but I think men would prefer you approached this in a more realistic manner.

The second comes mostly from the more mature women. They are looking for something they lost. A partner lost to circumstance, chance or perhaps an unrequited love from long ago. The mission is to find a collage of the 'best of' attributes of the men that have impacted your life. Worse yet is those who lost the love of your life and are looking for a mirror image of that person. The living cannot and should not compete with ghosts.

The third group are very self focused. They lay out everything about themselves. As if the search is for a male reflection of yourself. You look at your search from only your side. There is almost zero wiggle room for the men. Again I will ask how that is working for you?

Perhaps everyone needs to remember that there's only one thing that must be present in a relationship to make it work. Compromise. Give and take. Agreeing to disagree. Accept another person into your life that is no more perfect than you are. We all have a few things we won't compromise on. Religion, smoking, drugs, etc. Perfectly reasonable and acceptable. If your list is longer than 3-4 items maybe you should re-examine what's truly important.

If we all put away our lists and look at this search in a more down to earth way we'll have a much better chance of success. Let's expand our perspectives for who is acceptable to share our lives with. After all isn't it why we are here?

Here's to each one of us finding someone that makes us happy.

**I posted this a few weeks ago. The male response was overwhelming. They would love to meet you ladies. Give them a chance.**

I'm terrible at introductions, but I've been single for a few years and I feel like it's time to put myself out there in the dating world. It's kinda scary not gonna lie, but I'm ready to settle down.

I'm not looking for anything casual, so no hook ups whatsoever. However, I'm not looking to get married next week either lol. I'm a really nice lady, I'm honest, I take loyalty and trust very seriously. I'm kindhearted, down to earth, sweet. I'm simple, but not simple minded.

I have various interests, it's never a dull moment with me. I enjoy long walks, current events, pop culture. I'm always willing to try things at least once. I love movies, going out and about, happy hours, and cooking. I also go to church every Sunday, so if you're Catholic, then great, we'd get along great. I don't mind if you're religious or not, as long as you accept my faith, we'll be fine. I don't want to change you nor am I looking to change that. 

I'm outgoing, and talkative. As I've mentioned, it's never a dull moment with me. I have a wanderlust to see most of the world and if it were up to me I'd travel all the time. I love learning, especially new cultures. I have an open mind to an extend. 

I'm wanting someone who will accept me for who I am, appreciate my imperfections, encourage me to be a better person. I'm don't expect perfection, i want something real. I'm not expecting to fall in love, but I'm not opposed to it either. If you're looking for a girl that your mom would like, then search no further because that's me ;)

If you think we'd get along, feel free to email me, your pic gets my pic. I'm so real by the way, it's sad that Peyton Manning retired :(

OK. I'm really into fixing houses and interior design. I want to meet a guy (23-50) years old who know construction well and would really enjoy working on fixers with me and falling in love over a project of our own. 
Its nice to have something in common to enjoy. 
Knowing construction inside out is important but so is your temperament . you have to be fun easygoing, roll with the punches kind of guy with a big heart, loving, romantic, drama free, carefree, down to earth guy that want to be with a super cool girl with those same qualities for the long haul.

Well I will make this pretty short and to the point.

I am 27, I am a chef by trade going to school online to change up my career path. I live out on the family ""ranch"" while I save up to buy land and start building my life . I am hoping to share my life dream with someone, but I am working hard and doing it alone if I have to I won't settle anymore.

That being said I am by no means a perfect country girl. I am plus size a bit hard headed and have a tendency of running over or scaring people away. I guess you could say I am intense and it will take the right type of person who wont shy away from my plus size personality. (My attemp at a pun sounded better in my head sorry.) 

Anyway looking for a partner but not looking to move into said partnership right away let start as friends and see where that goes. 


Want to know more respond with you favorite hobby in the tag line and we can see if I am completely hopeless or not.

I am a 33 year old single girl. I have lived in Denver for about a year now. I love adventure and I love to travel. I spent almost 2 years backpacking around 3 continents.

I've been single for awhile, dated here and there but nothing serious. At this stage in life I trust my intuition, I'm not desperate or dating just to date. I've posted before and I get a vibe in the first few emails and if I don't feel something I don't respond. I had to come up with some kind of system, either that or spend ridiculous amounts of time emailing for nothing. I also trust if we are meant to be together, we'll meet.

I've been on the path of self discovery, self love and therefore healing. No matter what it looks like, an awake life is a very different life. I appreciate emotional awareness in a partner. I still believe in the healing power of love. I haven't given up on how I look. I've been told I'm attractive and for the most part comfortable with who I am.

The dilemma is that I miss the physical part of being in a relationship (not just sex - I find the touch of a loved one very healing). And yet, I'm not satisfied being physical with just anyone. I want it all. Willing to give it all as well.

So are we compatible? Here's a glimpse of what I find appealing:

We are on our own spiritual/healing path and also want to share a spiritual connection with a partner. (I'm not a God fearing woman, that's not the God I believe in).
We are awake and self reflective.
We are fit physically; fit or working on it, affectionate, playful, health oriented but not necessarily purists and are tall (I'm 5'10).
We are creative, open minded, passionate, generous, independent and also love being in partnership.
We're mostly home bodies but enjoy getting out, have an adventurous side and a sensual side.
We live within 45 min. of each other, I want to be able to see each other without a road trip.
We find each other attractive, even hot at times.
We are both single and looking for a LTR.
We know that being compatible doesn't mean we like and dislike all the same things, but that we coexist well.

If this resonates with you and you're in my age range (give or take 10 years), tell me about yourself and let's see what the possibilities are. A picture would be nice.
Thank you.

I am looking for a Daddy, NOT for age play or Daddy/daughter or being in diapers and dressed like a 'little'. I need the nurture, guidance and accountability, yet the affection and well the only word I can think of is gentleness typically thought to go with a 'Daddy' Dominant. Though that really isn't the best word to describe what I am looking for. I do need someone who has Daddy tendencies, but also someone who likes to play a little rough too. I am not a masochist, and I am not a 'little', though I long to be Daddy's baby girl. I am not new to this 'lifestyle', however in the past I have served in a strictly D/s type dynamic. I also would like a romantic relationship with my Dominant, so I am seeking a single Dominant who is looking for the same. As I am in search of a more Daddy type Dominant please be at least 40 to 50 years old, and single. I will share a face picture with you, I will not share any pictures of myself without clothes on, nor will I respond to commands from anyone. I do not serve until I meet you, which hopefully wont be long after we share a few emails and talk on the phone over several days. If you don't have time in your life to spend on a submissive please do move on. I do not need to see my Sir every day, but at least a few times a week, and I do need to be able to communicate with him throughout the day. I am serious about this, I miss serving, and being accountable for myself to a good Man. 

Just to put it out there I am a bbw, 5'1"" and 220lbs. I am also very loyal, and once I trust you, you will have all of my heart. So I know you are real, please put how tall you are in the subject line.

I'm not looking for casual sex, so if that's you you can skip me. Also skip if you're not into bigger girls, arguing, having fun, eating good food, or general awesomeness. Lets say age matters. I want to claim it is a number but we all know it is a time. the same thing an 18 year is into, me, as a 30 year old, likely just won't be.

It is true... I am truly missing you. You know who you are.. 
It was all to good to be true.. The first relationship after my horrible divorce... 
If this is you, you know how to contact me, you know where I live....
I miss it all about you. Your hansom face, your beautiful eye, your amazing smile, your loving touch, your amazing smell..
I miss the lazy nights on the couch, cuddling, watching TV after our long days at work. Your wonderful cooking!
I miss the cuddling all night while we both sleep. Your ever so genital love making!!! 
The fun and laughter we shared all the time. I dont ever remember us fighting. The most perfect 9 months of my life!!
Our weekends at the property, riding four wheelers. Sitting by the campfire. Giving you kisses on your sweaty neck and head while you cursed at replacing carpet and tile in the camper. The rides on your Harley! You still owe me!!
Our kids having fun together. Taking them to paint pottery, to Disney on Ice, to the Flea Market... Teaching your son how to make a Bow out of a stick and string...
Shooting nurf guns!! Spending time with your daughter, who was only here for part of the summer...
You scared me when you told me you loved me after being together for 8 months, I didnt think I was ready. I realized not long after that I did love you too... But it was too late... I have dated others, but its just not the same. Seems like everything I do, reminds me of you!!
Please I'd love to give it another chance.
Your birthday is in April, yes I remember!! Mine is in May.\
You have 2 kids and I have 3.

Hello Guys,

I am looking for guy that can make me laugh and has his life together. I am the type of woman that lets a man be a man (meaning the man takes the lead). I also want to get to know you slowly (the good, bad and the ugly). Nobody can hide their true colors for long. I do not drink or smoke, and prefer to find someone that doesn't smoke either; however I do not mind some casual drinking. Most of all I love to have fun. I love going to baseball games, barbeques, flea market, and taking long walks. I am not interested in anything casual (FWB NSA), and I do not like hidden agendas. Just be real!

I don't even like going out, I wouldn't mind finding someone who would just take me to their place and put on a movie and chat, but alas I can't seem to find a man like that.
I still would like to hang out with someone tonight, I can't have people over currently due to my roomates but wouldn't mind going somewhere after talking a bit to make sure you're not like, a serial killer haha.
I do want someone to smoke with tonight, I have a little bit to pitch. I'm a standard geeky punk style girl, I listen to alternative style music but adore other genres as well. I'm willing to trade a picture for a picture as well so you know I'm not someone weird. 
I adore art, and genuinely love food haha.
If you're interested don't hesitate to talk to me about maybe coming to pick me up tonight and see where it goes! :) Also, my name is Jenny.

Let's be honest here. What the hell kind of nickname is that? When I watched him in his little argyle sweater priss across a stage I knew right then he was unelectable on a national level. It wasn't his stupid ass 47% comment or his taxes or any of that. People want a leader they can relate to. Who the devil could relate with him. Trump on the other hand could be my uncle or guy next door as far as relatable goes . Shame on you mittens. I think your eyes are green with envy at the Don. Trump is a good guy and manly as well as an accomplished business man known world wide. It's true, when Trump speaks people listen. We know he is not a politician and that's why we love and respect him. How many politicians can say that? We all know Trump will be our next president, any moran can see that.

Like most things, there are pros and cons to dating. Sometimes it may seem like a necessary evil on the road to finding love (and it is), but that doesn't mean you don't sometimes want to throw your hands up in the air and say, ""forget it! I'd rather be single for life."" The planning, the getting your hopes up about a new guy, the being disappointed, the feeling like there are no decent guys left in the world, we've all been there. They do say you'll find the One when you stop looking, so maybe it's time we just put that little piece of dating wisdom to the test.

1. Guys who'd rather text forever than make solid plans. What is he waiting for? Does he need a hand written invitation in order to hang out with you in person? Even worse when you take a chance and ask him out, and he still can't seem to commit to anything.

2. When you find out he already has a girlfriend. But we had such a connection, what do you mean he's not single? Why would he flirt with me like that then?!

3. When your friend meets her soul mate after being on OKCupid for literally 24 hours. How is it that you could scour that site for weeks and barely scrape together a couple dates, and she finds the Chris Pratt in the online dating rough without even having a photo up?!

4. When he invites you out and then ""forgets"" his wallet. Look, we have no problem paying for our half, but when it's clear he had no intention of paying at all, we have to consider sneaking out through the bathroom window, and leaving him to wash dishes to pay off his debt.

5. When his idea of a date is bringing his entire entourage to meet you at a bar at midnight. A date shouldn't involve him making sure his wing man has a shot with one of your friends.

6. When you think it's going well and he freaks out because you left a spare tampon in his bathroom. Or worse, when he accuses you of leaving it there, but it was actually his roommate's girlfriend.

7. The third time you break up with the same person. Somehow it seemed more productive to revive an old relationship than find someone new. You were wrong. Twice. Dating is just too much work.

8. When you can't seem to get past the first date, ever. Even when it seems like the first date was fantastic, somehow planning the second date becomes harder than trying to schedule brunch with Beyonce.

9. The unsolicited dick pic. Once second you were innocently talking about the third season of House of Cards, and the next, there's a dick on your phone.

10. Watching your friend go through a bad breakup. If you start dating someone, there's a pretty good chance that crying mess on the couch eating an entire bag of Smart Food dipped in peanut butter will be you in the foreseeable future.

11. Coffee dates. Unless you're going on dates at 9am, caffeine is ill advised. No one wants to put any effort into first dates anymore, meaning you end up drinking way more lattes than you should be, and every date becomes pretty dull and repetitive.

12. When he looks nothing like his picture. The question is, do you call him on it, or do you force a polite smile, chug that latte, and get out of there asap?

13. When he leaves you with the bill because you didn't want to hook up. This guy doesn't even pretend he forgot his wallet. He just doesn't come back from the bathroom. So that's why he chose the corner booth with no view of the door.

14. Finding out he's a racist, homophobic, pro-life, misogynistic actual crazy person. It's official, there are no nice, normal guys left. You can end the search now.

15. When staying home in your pjs is more appealing than going out. You could go on another date with this guy, or that guy, but why bother? At least your cat doesn't have uncontrollable gas or make you watch UFC. Once you realize the gloriousness of being single, there isn't much short of a millionaire who looks like David Beckham that will convince you to go on a date ever again. At least for now.

I'm a total foodie and I enjoy fun, creative, upscale restaurants with knock-out service. I'm fine to go Dutch; I'm not looking for a free meal. Just a nice, polite, thoughtful man to be my date. I'm thinking Osteria Marco, 1515, ChoLon, Vesta Dipping, or another fabulous restaurant.

First, for the asthetics- I'm 5'7 and enjoy wearing tall heals. I have fair skin but keep a healthy tan. I have green eyes and dyed red hair. I'm 140 pounds, hwp, and am fairly active. I have a very plump derriere and tiny cupcakes up top.

I enjoy bourbon, beer, and wine. At home, I eat mostly organic veggies. But I'm not a picky eater. When I dine out is when I indulge. Oh, and I love sweets and coffee!

Ideally, you're under 40, tall, trim/fit, and funny. You keep a polished wardrobe and have good hygiene. And you don't have to receive a cue to remember to hold the door. If the evening goes well, I would hope you're dominant and a little kinky. I enjoy playing a submissive role behind closed doors. I enjoy anal play and toys and I think coconut oil is the best lube.

If any of this makes sense, reply with an email. I have pics, but I'll share once I know you're awesome! Please no one-liners! I've expressed myself here pretty clearly. 

Yes, I'm real. I live on Parker Rd near Cherry Creek Reservoir. The donkeys won the Super Bowl and it's been the year with no winter. Anyone else feeling the Bern?

I am a 49 year old young woman here in the hopes of finding just one man who might turn out to be the one who will be my best friend, my one and only. I am a grounded, attractive, witty woman with a great job and disposition who is looking to meet someone who is stable, light hearted & mature. I have blonde hair, blue eyes. I am in good shape, considered attractive. I look forward to hearing from you - something about you, where you live, what you are looking for. Not just hi, not just send me a pic. I'm not here for one night stands or to have an affair with a married man or to be FWB. I love going to the city, the Jersey Shore, Atlantic City - for a little bit everything (not just to gamble), flea markets, movies in or out, going out to eat - doesn't have to be fancy, I love a good burger! Hopefully we can meet for a cup of coffee and see if there are sparks. There must be sparks....right? I live in Hudson County. Hopefully you are close by.
Like Lincoln, I think in the end it is not the years in our lives that count, but the life in our years ... isn't it why we are on this Russian roulette of hopes and third chances? Hoping to find a love that is long and kind, old and new. Someone who is cautious in life but not in love and friendship, and whose wisdom came out with winter.

Me: I think there is little worth in virtue and little fault in mistakes, my biggest sin is pride, I think all people should have food and shelter and access to good medical care. I don't pray. I'm loyal, a mother, a sister, a worker. I'm unattached and available, unafraid. Looking for same.

I enjoy going to movies, plays, concerts, exhibits and the like.

I am divorced and childless.

If your stats are compatible with mine and you are either divorced or widowed, I would enjoy hearing from you. I prefer someone within a few miles of Bergen County (Paramus area) so that we can meet on a whim when we feel like it.

Please tell me about yourself the same kind of things I have told you about me. AGE, MARITAL STATUS, EDUCATIONAL LEVEL and PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION are mandatory. For the recored, I am 5' and weigh 115.

I look forward to some quality replies from some quality people. A simple ""How ya doing?"" gets deleted w/o a response.

Why come to CL, land of hook-ups and people seeking pictures for mysterious and nefarious reasons, to look for men? Perhaps it's a bad idea, or maybe I am just cheap. I have tried Match, and I met several retirees who claimed to be in their 40s. I just can't invest in it.

I am a successful, educated professional who is seeking a single man. Let's face it, sex is great, but I am not looking for a FWB or hook-up. There are several thousand other posts offering that if that is your thing. 

I have a weakness for smart men, and I am a bit of a nerd myself. I am curvy, but I ran four miles today, so that doesn't mean morbidly obese. I work out six days a week, I cook, and I read.

As I sit here and ponder on what I am looking for and what I desire, I had to take time to reflect on those in which I have met on here. 

Over the past 6 months I have learned so much about myself, about dating, about who I am, who I want to be and most important, what I am looking for in a partner. 

In that time, I have loved, I have lost, I have created great memories, but most of all, I have become a stronger, better woman. 

The heartbreak was almost unbearable, but I am not looking at with any regrets. I was a scared, weak, fragile woman when I met the man that changed my life forever. He turned me into this beautiful woman, who is strong, confident, loving, and yes still a little fragile. The stars were all aligned the night we met. Little did I know that the stars would slowly fade, and in time go their separate ways. He as often questioned why he had such an impact on me. My answer to that is: He treated me like a woman, he had respect for me, and he showed me what love was all about. 

Since this man left my life, I have found it to be a struggle to find someone of quality. That is why I question if this is the right place to look. That is when I am reminded of him and all hope comes back, that there will be that one amazing man out there for me. I can't give up and waste this precious heart by not sharing it with the right person. 

With all that being said, let me tell you a little more abut myself: 

I am single, I have a professional career, I also have children, my own place, my own vehicle, and a kindred spirit. I enjoy going for walks in the evenings, long mountains drives to nowhere, outdoor concerts, a glass of wine by the fireplace, a cup of coffee on the patio, camping, watching movies, cuddling and many more things. 

I am looking for someone between 35-50, employed, independent, romantic, fun loving, outgoing, has moral, family values, and not afraid to show emotion. 

So, after reading my short story, if you are interested in getting to know me more, all I can say is that you won't regret it. Even if we don't have a physical attraction, we can have a wonderful friendship. 

I look forward to hearing from you. Have a great weekend.

So, how come it's so hard to find the one we love and want to share our life with? I think a lot has to do with the fact that the internet controls almost everything. It allows us to post but if we don't want to reply we don't have to. Or, we can reply for awhile and then just drop off the face of the earth if we want to. We can tease each other without ever seeing each other. We can lie, cheat and show each other fake pictures if we want. Or, the picture rules whether you will meet this person or not regardless if you might be compatible. Why? Because the internet allows us to. 
What has happened to good old romance, meeting in a public place, being able to laugh, be honest and respectful of each other, not expecting sex right away, and sharing a walk, movie, art gallery or museum? Why can't we get to know each other? Everything today is so now, now, now, instant gratification. I'm an old fashion woman. Maybe, because I'm older (57) is why I'm not so now, now now, I was brought up with the Ten Commandments and the golden rule. Two concepts that a lot of people just ignore today. Stop and smell the roses!
Also, why is it so hard for some people to communicate effectively? If you don't like what you see or something has pissed you off, just talk about it nicely and say what you mean. I hate liars and people who ignore the situation. Obviously, not into games.
Would love to meet a man who is honest, sophisticated, a gentlemen who has a warm heart, has his life together, smart, FUNNY, sensual, articulate, knows what he wants in life, will treat a woman with respect, love and admiration. Someone who loves animals. 
It would be nice to find my last lover, friend and companion here on Craigslist but not sure it will happen but if you don't put yourself out there you won't see if you will get what you are looking for. Right? Please put your favorite mexican food in the subject line. Please be a non-smoker of cigarettes but 420 friendly.

Hello there- 

Please only respond to this post if your MWM - 35-99 :) I appreciate your courtesy. 

I'm looking for a great guy who is my equal; companionate, sexy, funny, classy, educated, articulate motivated, opinionated and all around good person.. I'm seeking a long term affair, a friendship to build on, nothing more then we each can give. No pressure, friends/lovers type of relationship. Not just sex!! I am very open minded, but like most woman and some men , we need more then just sex- if you understand what a woman needs/wants that would be perfect! So if a hook up is all you need from this then I'm not your match. I wish you luck, I know there's someone out there for you.
Now if your still reading, I think I may want to hear from you! 

Attraction; both inner and outer is important; so if your not attracted to curvy types, full figured, big features, then I wouldn't be for you, I am just being honest- we all have our own likes. I'm attracted to the ""husband"" next door :) type! 


I am not looking to change my life as it is now, just really some enhancement, something different and new...those butterflies we miss from a long term marriage. A spark, some lust and excitement -you get the idea. 
Just a simple friendship that will benefit both of us.
Let's see if we connect! 


Thank you for considering my plight :) 
hope we find each other soon!

I am a rather simple woman and the it's the simple things that make me happy. I like hanging out and getting to know each other. It does not have to be anything fancy. Maybe a drink on the patio, a movie to cuddle too, a warm fireplace? I also enjoy being outdoors. There are so many things to see and do in Colorado and it would be nice to find someone to share those times with. 

I am not into games or drama. Please save that for T.V. I have my life in order and I am just missing that special someone to share it with.

I happen to have those song lyrics stuck in my head at the moment. If you feel you can relate to them we have much to discuss. About me: I'm a crazed musician, comedic writer/performer grounded caregiver aimless wanderer and writer of lists. I am open to getting to know any genuine person and all the surface qualities while interesting and at times eye catching are just that. I am in search of a deeper connection, whatever that may be. Open to age (but be over 20 and under 200 please),race, religion, social status etc. A genuine, fun person I'd love to know could be any combination of these. It seems hard to describe myself with any true objectivity so get to know me and judge for yourself. Growing up was usually seen as part wall flower and part class clown which led me to be the introverted goofball I am today. ""Goofball"" doesn't strike me as a word that people usually seriously type and certainly not in the context of trying to meet someone but I guess I just did. Anyway, Merry February! No one ever says that anymore. Especially not in March. I look forward to hearing from you!

I could start out by telling you lots about me - I'm shy, Not a skinny twig, a mom, I like to read, hike, camp, fish, be outdoors in this beautiful state. I could tell you I'm a bit sassy, hate drama, and that I'm looking for the real deal, that I'm in my early thirties and looking for someone older than me. I should also mention I'm an old fashioned kind of gal - I want to be married and be someone's other half. 
I'm in the north springs but wouldn't hesitate to relocate for the right guy.
It's late and I should be sleeping but instead I'm thinking about how perfect it would be to finally find my guy. If you are going to respond please don't be already in a relationship because that doesn't work for me. Don't be someone that doesn't want an affectionate loving gal either because well I am both :) And lastly - you have got to be ok with being a strong male role model to my kiddos because their dads not really in the picture. Ok that's enough for now :) get creative with the title of your post so I know you're real :)

Hello!
I'm new at the internet dating thing, so please bare with me! I'm sure hoping there's a man out there who enjoys the finer things in life! I love camping, air conditioning, Coca-Cola, beaches, reading, traveling and trivia! I have odd hobbies such as listing abandoned castles I want to visit in Europe and love a good conspiracy theory. I have a very dark sense of humor and love to joke around, so being able to laugh it off is a must!

I'm white, thin and in my mid-30's. Because I'm not getting any younger - I'm really hoping to find someone who might enjoy meeting up with our kids, cooking, wine drinking (wine tasting, blah - give me the bottle) and planning outings, like camping or even better, hot springs! I don't work out, I really mean to ... if you see me running, you should run too because something is probably chasing me, lol. 

I'm not religious, but I am spiritual - I love that line in itself. I have kids and a nice home and simply wondering if there is a man out there looking for the same? 420 Friendly, though NEVER around children.

If you snore, don't even bother responding, though snoring when drunk is acceptable =)

I'm not interested in handing out my phone number or emailing off a picture of myself - nor am I interested in a picture of your cock, lol. If you'd like to strike up a conversation and possibly meet for drinks if things go well, please drop me a line. I love to chat, debate and write so writing is usually the best way for me to get to know a person. 

Please place the words YOLO in the subject line so I know that you're a real person - there are some real freaks on CL and I'm simply not looking for anymore in my life, JK.

I realize this is in the relationship section. But before we can become bedroom partners we must meet and become friends. A meeting for me so that I can see who you are. That will tell me a lot. I don't want to do endless emails with out meeting first. Loneliness isn't fun and I've been doing it for a long while. My goal with this add is to find that special someone that wants to enjoy life and likes adventure. I am a widowed senior lady living in Roundup. The walls don't do conversation very well and the 3 cats and 2 dogs have their own language that I don't understand very well. LOL I am a clean lady and keep a clean house minus a little dog and cat hair. LOL I love to be outdoors weather permitting, fishing and hunting, yard work what ever needs attention. I also enjoy the indoors with that very special someone, cuddling, laughing, general conversation. Laughter makes for a fun day. There is no alcohol or drugs in my home and smoking is done on the porch. I own my home and 2 vehicles. They aren't much but they are mine. I am looking into selling out and moving to a warmer climate because I'm tired of fighting the cold and snow alone. It will take someone very special to change my mind. Are you that someone? If so you will need to convince me. 
In your response please put your age and a recent picture. Put Fun in the subject line so I can find it when it goes to my spam folder. No picture no reply. An informative reply will get my attention. No 1 liners. I will send a picture back. Thank you for reading this and have a wonderful day.

Howdy, CL.
I am hoping there is a young (or young at heart) man out there interested in watching the six nations games this saturday with a new friend. Any easy going, calm, but interested soul is welcome to message me. 

The games are being broadcast on BBC now, so it should not be impossible to find somewhere playing it, or even to watch at home. While I support Fado and other bars downtown playing the games I am not willing to fight my way into and out of SXSW crowds to get there. 

Along the same line, if you are hosting a big party, then sorry, I just don't have the fortitude to meet and party with your whole team. (for you active players in Austin) 

It would be super if you had interests outside of the pitch so we could talk between games, but if you got hit in the head playing a few too many times I guess I'll still be your friend...

I look forward to meeting you, and to everyone out there be safe. Saturday is a rugby day!

Not to be off-puting, but it bears re-itterating, I am just looking for a rugby watching buddy, not a f*buddy. Thanks!

***See? Not trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes. So, if fat chicks disturb the fuck out of you, go ahead and click that back button. And while I appreciate the thoughtful emails about how fat cows are dumb, lazy and can't attract a man....please know, your words have really no impact on my psyche or self-esteem...sorry to bum you guys out.***

I know there are awesome guys out there that appreciate thicker chicks. I know this because I've dated them, been in relationships with them, and was even married to one. And all the better if you dig whip sharp, intelligent, science geek sorta girls. And, well, it's not enough to just like smart girls, you have to be similarly intelligent or else we'll never get along. I'm definitely more introverted (not that you'd ever guess during conversation) and really loathe small talk, but get me on a fascinating or politically incorrect topic and I will have plenty to say. I love sci-fi/fantasy/horror books/shows. Battlestar Galactica, Game of Thrones, Helix, Z-Nation, Walking Dead. I watched a lot of PBS NOVA, Frontline, Discovery documentaries and nature programs growing up and I think that pushed me to pursue a science based career.....and the best part? I LOVE what I do....every day. 

Good stuff: I'm super cute, affectionate, giving, nurturing, intelligent but also street smart, capable, independent. Easy-going, not high maintenance, not into drama, bickering, fighting. ( I'm also not really into the fact that shit about Kim Kardashian pops up in my news feed. Seriously, when did vapid, dumb bitches suddenly become news worthy?) I'm also an excellent chef and baker of all things yummy. No kids...unless you count one awesome-sauce hound. Oh, and I'm a stickler about being on-time everywhere I go. I like weird movies, horror movies, B movies, scary movies. I also love music...and have a VERY eclectic palette. 

Bad stuff: I have a low threshold for bullshit, liars and people who make excuses. Ditto shitty people and/or dumb-asses. I frequently misplace things I need on a daily basis like my car keys and wallet. I'm not an adrenaline junkie so, no, I won't be skiing or snowboarding off the sides of mountains with you. I'd rather ramble around a forest hunting down animals and edible mushrooms than scaling snow-covered summits (OMG it's almost like I don't belong in Colorado!!!) I also have a bad habit of enjoying tickling people who are really ticklish. And...I have a potty mouth. 

Anyway, again, really only interested in chatting with guys who have their lives together, live independently, aren't riddled with drama. Brownie points if you're taller than me (Colorado is unilaterally populated with short guys...not to say I have a problem with that, when you're tall you get used to dating guys shorter than you). You should be able to hold your own in conversation, be friendly, and probably on the nerdy side yourself. I do have a 'thing' for cute white guys with dark hair and glasses are....awesome. :) Please also be close to my age...so.... let's say 29 to 40.

I'm terrible at introductions, but I've been single for a few years and I feel like it's time to put myself out there in the dating world. It's kinda scary not gonna lie, but I'm ready to settle down.

I'm not looking for anything casual, so no hook ups whatsoever. However, I'm not looking to get married next week either lol. I'm a really nice lady, I'm honest, I take loyalty and trust very seriously. I'm kindhearted, down to earth, sweet. I'm simple, but not simple minded.

I have various interests, it's never a dull moment with me. I enjoy long walks, current events, pop culture. I'm always willing to try things at least once. I love movies, going out and about, happy hours, and cooking. I also go to church every Sunday, so if you're Catholic, then great, we'd get along great. I don't mind if you're religious or not, as long as you accept my faith, we'll be fine. I don't want to change you nor am I looking to change that. 

I'm outgoing, and talkative. As I've mentioned, it's never a dull moment with me. I have a wanderlust to see most of the world and if it were up to me I'd travel all the time. I love learning, especially new cultures. I have an open mind to an extend. 

I'm wanting someone who will accept me for who I am, appreciate my imperfections, encourage me to be a better person. I'm don't expect perfection, i want something real. I'm not expecting to fall in love, but I'm not opposed to it either. If you're looking for a girl that your mom would like, then search no further because that's me ;)

If you think we'd get along, feel free to email me, your pic gets my pic. I'm so real by the way, it's sad that Peyton Manning retired :(

I've been single for awhile, dated here and there but nothing serious. At this stage in life I trust my intuition, I'm not desperate or dating just to date. I've posted before and I get a vibe in the first few emails and if I don't feel something I don't respond. I had to come up with some kind of system, either that or spend ridiculous amounts of time emailing for nothing. I also trust if we are meant to be together, we'll meet.

I've been on the path of self discovery, self love and therefore healing. No matter what it looks like, an awake life is a very different life. I appreciate emotional awareness in a partner. I still believe in the healing power of love. I haven't given up on how I look. I've been told I'm attractive and for the most part comfortable with who I am.

The dilemma is that I miss the physical part of being in a relationship (not just sex - I find the touch of a loved one very healing). And yet, I'm not satisfied being physical with just anyone. I want it all. Willing to give it all as well.

So are we compatible? Here's a glimpse of what I find appealing:

We are on our own spiritual/healing path and also want to share a spiritual connection with a partner. (I'm not a God fearing woman, that's not the God I believe in).
We are awake and self reflective.
We are fit physically; fit or working on it, affectionate, playful, health oriented but not necessarily purists and are tall (I'm 5'10).
We are creative, open minded, passionate, generous, independent and also love being in partnership.
We're mostly home bodies but enjoy getting out, have an adventurous side and a sensual side.
We live within 45 min. of each other, I want to be able to see each other without a road trip.
We find each other attractive, even hot at times.
We are both single and looking for a LTR.
We know that being compatible doesn't mean we like and dislike all the same things, but that we coexist well.

If this resonates with you and you're in my age range (give or take 10 years), tell me about yourself and let's see what the possibilities are. A picture would be nice.
Thank you.

I'm myself. I'm an opinionated, bossy, adventurous, friendly, easily excited female person. Looking for someone to hangout and spend time with. I'm a girl with many interests, none of them are the broncos, but some of them include:(CF-semi colons are sexy, use when approriate) acting like a 5 year old, parks, museums and video games.... just don't make fun of how bad I am at games though.

I'm not looking for casual sex, so if that's you you can skip me. Also skip if you're not into bigger girls, arguing, having fun, eating good food, or general awesomeness. Lets say age matters. I want to claim it is a number but we all know it is a time. the same thing an 18 year is into, me, as a 30 year old, likely just won't be. The other way, me and 40 year olds just won't vibe on the same things. I welcome people of all ages, but really I know better than to think outside of my age group. CHILDREN AT HEART TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE... sorry, my inner child got out.

If you're interested say something interesting 

Oh and to the guy who is going to send me the message calling me fat and unworthy, thank you for your criticism and your flag. But please get some help. If you need resources I have access to all kinds of mental health help. If you don't need resources... well I guess thanks for thinking me worthy of your hatred.

I am a pretty straight forward person and I am not a huge fan being coy or doing the ""mysterious, mixed signal"" stuff. With that being said, I am not looking for a partner who displays the latter. We are both adults.

I work and like to travel when I can. I am not a girly girl, so if you like high maintenance, six inche stilettos, and a pundit of make up...you are reading the wrong ad. I don't mind getting dirty or working hard. Can I dress up, yes, but I like casual as well.

I have a best friend that is a guy. You have to be ok with that. I love to read and can get pretty ""holed up"" with a good book. I also love to catch a good movie (Marvel movies are awesome). Long walks sound like bullshit, but I do love those as well.

I am one of those BBW people and I personally love the older stocky, tall men. I heard some call it the ""Dad Body"". More to love on both ends, lol. I am not really attracted to thin or overly athletic men. Consequently, I have to state that I like men with good hygiene.

Hi I'm Christine. Single no kids or pets but love both. College educated and just looking for my best friend who is tall, smart, loving and honest. I just moved back to Denver from FL. Please send a RECENT picture. I have to be attracted physically but looks only go so far if the inside is bad. I've been thru a lot in life so no crazy stress or drama. I survived a bad car wreck which is why I want to be with someone who is content and is positive in life like me. I'm very humble and enjoy peace in life. No alcoholics or illegal drug addicts. Lost two boyfriends to alcohol and can't go through that again. Thanks for reading and send me a pic and maybe if were attracted to each other we can start off as friends and go from there. :)

Hello! I already know guys either love or hate my body type, so I've attached a pic to get that out of the way so you know what you're getting into. I'm a curvy and cute lady who really wants to find a loving and lasting relationship. I love to travel, camp, ride motorcycles, go out to dinner, or make some homecooked meals for a good man who appreciates me.

I've been described by friends as a bit of a free spirit, yet very down to earth when it comes to business and my finances. I like to be very sweet and kind to those closest to me, but I also have no problems speaking up for myself and saying it like it is. I love to get out in the mountains, camp by a river, walk the shoreline, window shop, basically just get out and LIVE! I don't stay home much, and I don't even own a TV. I do attend church as well.

I honestly have everything I need in life. Except my last partner. In my mind, I picture him to be white, aged 40-55 with a bigger build, and tends to have a rugged look. (Country boy/outdoors type/ Harley Rider/hunter/you get the idea - sorry, that's my type and I stick to it. I also don't date younger guys. Even 40 is pushing it for me.)

He is SINGLE (not married, not separated, no other gf's he hasn't cut loose yet, or other strings attached), he is WILLING (past the casual hookup stage, wants a serious relationship, not still hung up on his last gf), and he is ABLE (doesn't work 24/7, doesn't have so many family obligations that you are dead last in his life, and has plans to make someone part of his life).

So, I think I've given you enough to work with. Your pic gets mine. I don't expect a lot of responses since I'm being so specific, but that's ok. I only need to find the one true guy for me.

I happen to have those song lyrics stuck in my head at the moment. If you feel you can relate to them we have much to discuss. About me: I'm a crazed musician, comedic writer/performer grounded caregiver aimless wanderer and writer of lists. I am open to getting to know any genuine person and all the surface qualities while interesting and at times eye catching are just that. I am in search of a deeper connection, whatever that may be. Open to age (but be over 20 and under 200 please),race, religion, social status etc. A genuine, fun person I'd love to know could be any combination of these. It seems hard to describe myself with any true objectivity so get to know me and judge for yourself. Growing up was usually seen as part wall flower and part class clown which led me to be the introverted goofball I am today. ""Goofball"" doesn't strike me as a word that people usually seriously type and certainly not in the context of trying to meet someone but I guess I just did. Anyway, Merry February! No one ever says that anymore. Especially not in March. I look forward to hearing from you!

I am a pretty straight forward person and I am not a huge fan being coy or doing the ""mysterious, mixed signal"" stuff. With that being said, I am not looking for a partner who displays the latter. We are both adults.

I work and like to travel when I can. I am not a girly girl, so if you like high maintenance, six inche stilettos, and a pundit of make up...you are reading the wrong ad. I don't mind getting dirty or working hard. Can I dress up, yes, but I like casual as well.

I have a best friend that is a guy. You have to be ok with that. I love to read and can get pretty ""holed up"" with a good book. I also love to catch a good movie (Marvel movies are awesome). Long walks sound like bullshit, but I do love those as well.

I am one of those BBW people and I personally love the older stocky, tall men. I heard some call it the ""Dad Body"". More to love on both ends, lol. I am not really attracted to thin or overly athletic men. Consequently, I have to state that I like men with good hygiene. I am also black.

I would love to go on, but I don't someone's eyes to cross. Change the subject to your location (preferably in North Denver) and include a pic. Some info about you wouldn't hurt.

I am pretty good with stating whether I am interested or not, but if I don't get back to you, I am not interested. Be an adult and move on gracefully.

As I sit here and ponder on what I am looking for and what I desire, I had to take time to reflect on those in which I have met on here. 

Over the past 6 months I have learned so much about myself, about dating, about who I am, who I want to be and most important, what I am looking for in a partner. 

In that time, I have loved, I have lost, I have created great memories, but most of all, I have become a stronger, better woman. 

The heartbreak was almost unbearable, but I am not looking at with any regrets. I was a scared, weak, fragile woman when I met the man that changed my life forever. He turned me into this beautiful woman, who is strong, confident, loving, and yes still a little fragile. The stars were all aligned the night we met. Little did I know that the stars would slowly fade, and in time go their separate ways. He as often questioned why he had such an impact on me. My answer to that is: He treated me like a woman, he had respect for me, and he showed me what love was all about. 

Since this man left my life, I have found it to be a struggle to find someone of quality. That is why I question if this is the right place to look. That is when I am reminded of him and all hope comes back, that there will be that one amazing man out there for me. I can't give up and waste this precious heart by not sharing it with the right person. 

With all that being said, let me tell you a little more abut myself: 

I am single, I have a professional career, I also have children, my own place, my own vehicle, and a kindred spirit. I enjoy going for walks in the evenings, long mountains drives to nowhere, outdoor concerts, a glass of wine by the fireplace, a cup of coffee on the patio, camping, watching movies, cuddling and many more things. 

I am looking for someone between 35-50, employed, independent, romantic, fun loving, outgoing, has moral, family values, and not afraid to show emotion. 

So, after reading my short story, if you are interested in getting to know me more, all I can say is that you won't regret it. Even if we don't have a physical attraction, we can have a wonderful friendship.

Hi,

About Me

I have many interests. I love football, it's freaking awesome. I make sure I keep up to date with my favorite team, the Denver Broncos! I even dabbled in fantasy football just for fun. I enjoy reading books, I like many different genres. I like watching movies- home or in the theater. I love listening to music, especially like going to concerts. Again, I like different genres. I like to explore this wonderful state but I would love to travel outside the state. ( I haven't in a couple of years) I like to cook and try out new recipes. I like taste testers! I also am a closet nerd. I like to watch action movies based on comic book characters and watch anime from time to time. I used to play video games a lot but now not so much. I do play board games with my friends once in a while but not the whole D &D business. I try to go to the gym at least 3 times a week. I like to have a good time with friends and family. Not interested in clubbing, but I don't mind going out for drinks once in a while. 

More about me, I'm Latina but please do not email me calling me your ""mamacita"" I'm tall for a Latina so I would love to talk to someone that is taller than me. Dark hair and dark eyes. On the heavy almost curvy side for now (not huge, still have a waist), but been working out and taking care of me so I have been losing weight. 

You
Between the ages I've asked for. Have similar interests like I do, and if you like most of my interests, you should be tolerant of the ones you're not into. Taller than 5'10 would be nice. I'm a sucker for dark hair, eyes, and a nice trimmed beard. You have a stable job and have a nice balance of going out and staying in. (So you don't mind going out and doing something like movies and dinner, putt putt golfing, etc but are willing to have dinner at home and cuddle on the couch and watch movies) Preferably someone that does not smoke. For the love of Pete, please do not message me if you are in a relationship, if you are truly unhappy, then end it. 

If interested, please change the subject line to your favorite food so I can weed out the spam. Don't be afraid to tell me about yourself!! Send pictures if you really want my attention.

I'm real. Yesterday Von Miller was on Dancing with the Stars and it is starting to be a nice day today... supposed to snow tomorrow. 

Hope to hear from you soon!

Are there any real old school guys out there?
Hello there,
My Name is ☆ ~ Rachel ~ ☆
I am 4'10, 190lbs, blue/green eyes, red hair but I dye my hair often, I love to be outdoors, I like to swim, go noodling, catch crawdads. I am fem but not super girly girl. I don't cry over broken nails, I dress in what makes me feel comfortable. I am 420 friendly. I have 5 tattoos and 8 piercings. A great date would be anything but the movies. I like to sit under a tree and have a picnic. I do work.

I hope to find my stud prince who is either 4'10 or taller, slim or curvy and who is looking for something real. Hoping to find the right man. I go more for personality then looks.

Not sure if I want to venture down this road. Risk of getting hurt but potentially having the time of my life.

I am posting in hopes to find a good guy who would ideally want a relationship. I know he is out there somewhere and know that with persistence he will show up :) I am not looking for perfect, but I am looking for ""perfect for me."" About me- I am 45 year old. I am a mom... which means I can't be as spontaneous as I would sometimes like to be. I am very honest and strive to be kind and understanding. I am very affectionate, funny, and passionate. I don't smoke and rarely drink. I am not a fan of marijuana and would prefer not to date someone who is. I am a spiritual person.... I am looking for a guy who knows how to be honest and always respectful. Someone who loves children- maybe even someone who has a child as well. I would love someone who has no problem talking about how he feels and what he thinks. Intelligent conversations can be a great turn on. I am a very affectionate person and fo better with someone who is as well. Soooo if this sounds at all interesting to you I would love to hear from you... maybe we would be ""perfect"" together.

I am so sick of whole dating web sites. I am mostly posting this because there is a man out there for me who is respectable and wanting the same things I am looking for. (You never know where you may find him).
A little about me, I am 30 swf that is 5'4 brown hair and blue eyes. I am family oriented and not much into drinking, so bars are not my scene. (Also no 420 or other drugs) I like to go see new places, so many things to do in Colorado alone. I have a job which takes up most of my week. I am not looking for Prince Charming, I am looking for my best friend. I just want someone who wants to share their life with me and I can do the same. 

You must be able to take care of yourself, have a job and car. I am not looking for a fwb, hook up or one night stand. please do not send me a message if that is what you are looking for.

Good Morning, 
I am starting to get spring fever over here. I would love to find a kind man to spend my time with. 

I am a rather simple woman and the it's the simple things that make me happy. I like hanging out and getting to know each other. It does not have to be anything fancy. Maybe a drink on the patio, a movie to cuddle too, a warm fireplace? I also enjoy being outdoors. There are so many things to see and do in Colorado and it would be nice to find someone to share those times with. 

I am not into games or drama. Please save that for T.V. I have my life in order and I am just missing that special someone to share it with. 

If you would like to chat more, let's talk and see where it goes. Maybe we can get together this weekend?

Beautiful, curvy, plus-size woman (smaller, round assets), intelligent, funny, adventurous, compassionate, kind, music-lover, seeking wonderful man (prefer caucasian men) between the ages of 40-55 for dating, companionship and the possibilities of more. I am 43, separated, filed for divorce, no drama, no kids, two dogs, and looking for an affectionate, kind, funny counterpart to enjoy a variety of experiences, ideally someone to date on occasion. 

Love craft beer, live music, spontaneous road trips, books and movies, anything creative, (I am a singer), passionate about people (helping professions 20+ years). Easygoing, not high-maintenance, no crazy ex's, not needy or looking to be ""fixed"" or ""rescued"". I am a big romantic at heart and need physical touch with the right chemistry like I do air to breathe...

I guess I need to be clear about what I am not looking for..... I am not seeking an affair with a married or ""attached"" man, a ""fling"", a one-night stand, or just a FWB situation. Not interested in endless texting/sexting or ""exchanging adult photos"". Please do not send me a picture of your penis as a ""hello""- I will delete it immediately (C'mon,. really????). :) :) :) Tell me about yourself, include a smiling pic and we'll go from there.

And for the record- I know ""curvy"" or ""BBW"" are buzz words you may not like, and it's okay. Move on, and good luck- no need for fat-shaming, nasty emails. 

Please include your first name and PIC and I will gladly return a pic with interest. PLEASE PUT A FAVORITE MOVIE TITLE IN THE SUBJECT LINE- All others will be deleted without opening.

First, for the asthetics- I'm 5'7 and enjoy wearing tall heals. I have fair skin but keep a healthy tan. I have green eyes and dyed red hair. I'm 140 pounds, hwp, and am fairly active. I have a very plump derriere and tiny cupcakes up top.

I enjoy bourbon, beer, and wine. At home, I eat mostly organic veggies. But I'm not a picky eater. When I dine out is when I indulge. Oh, and I love sweets and coffee!

Ideally, you're under 40, tall, trim/fit, and funny. You keep a polished wardrobe and have good hygiene. And you don't have to receive a cue to remember to hold the door. If the evening goes well, I would hope you're dominant and a little kinky. I enjoy playing a submissive role behind closed doors. I enjoy anal play and toys and I think coconut oil is the best lube.

If any of this makes sense, reply with an email. I have pics, but I'll share once I know you're awesome! Please no one-liners! I've expressed myself here pretty clearly. 

Yes, I'm real. I live on Parker Rd near Cherry Creek Reservoir. The donkeys won the Super Bowl and it's been the year with no winter. Anyone else feeling the Bern?

Hello there- 

Please only respond to this post if your MWM - 35-99 :) I appreciate your courtesy. 

I'm looking for a great guy who is my equal; companionate, sexy, funny, classy, educated, articulate motivated, opinionated and all around good person.. I'm seeking a long term affair, a friendship to build on, nothing more then we each can give. No pressure, friends/lovers type of relationship. Not just sex!! I am very open minded, but like most woman and some men , we need more then just sex- if you understand what a woman needs/wants that would be perfect! So if a hook up is all you need from this then I'm not your match. I wish you luck, I know there's someone out there for you.
Now if your still reading, I think I may want to hear from you! 

Attraction; both inner and outer is important; so if your not attracted to curvy types, full figured, big features, then I wouldn't be for you, I am just being honest- we all have our own likes. I'm attracted to the ""husband"" next door :) type! 


I am not looking to change my life as it is now, just really some enhancement, something different and new...those butterflies we miss from a long term marriage. A spark, some lust and excitement -you get the idea. 
Just a simple friendship that will benefit both of us.
Let's see if we connect! 


Thank you for considering my plight :) 
hope we find each other soon!

Hello!
I'm new at the internet dating thing, so please bare with me! I'm sure hoping there's a man out there who enjoys the finer things in life! I love camping, air conditioning, Coca-Cola, beaches, reading, traveling and trivia! I have odd hobbies such as listing abandoned castles I want to visit in Europe and love a good conspiracy theory. I have a very dark sense of humor and love to joke around, so being able to laugh it off is a must!

I'm white, thin and in my mid-30's. Because I'm not getting any younger - I'm really hoping to find someone who might enjoy meeting up with our kids, cooking, wine drinking (wine tasting, blah - give me the bottle) and planning outings, like camping or even better, hot springs! I don't work out, I really mean to ... if you see me running, you should run too because something is probably chasing me, lol. 

I'm not religious, but I am spiritual - I love that line in itself. I have kids and a nice home and simply wondering if there is a man out there looking for the same? 420 Friendly, though NEVER around children.

If you snore, don't even bother responding, though snoring when drunk is acceptable =)

I'm not interested in handing out my phone number or emailing off a picture of myself - nor am I interested in a picture of your cock, lol. If you'd like to strike up a conversation and possibly meet for drinks if things go well, please drop me a line. I love to chat, debate and write so writing is usually the best way for me to get to know a person. 

Please place the words YOLO in the subject line so I know that you're a real person - there are some real freaks on CL and I'm simply not looking for anymore in my life, JK.

I realize this is in the relationship section. But before we can become bedroom partners we must meet and become friends. A meeting for me so that I can see who you are. That will tell me a lot. I don't want to do endless emails with out meeting first. Loneliness isn't fun and I've been doing it for a long while. My goal with this add is to find that special someone that wants to enjoy life and likes adventure. I am a widowed senior lady living in Roundup. The walls don't do conversation very well and the 3 cats and 2 dogs have their own language that I don't understand very well. LOL I am a clean lady and keep a clean house minus a little dog and cat hair. LOL I love to be outdoors weather permitting, fishing and hunting, yard work what ever needs attention. I also enjoy the indoors with that very special someone, cuddling, laughing, general conversation. Laughter makes for a fun day. There is no alcohol or drugs in my home and smoking is done on the porch. I own my home and 2 vehicles. They aren't much but they are mine. I am looking into selling out and moving to a warmer climate because I'm tired of fighting the cold and snow alone. It will take someone very special to change my mind. Are you that someone? If so you will need to convince me. 
In your response please put your age and a recent picture. Put Fun in the subject line so I can find it when it goes to my spam folder. No picture no reply. An informative reply will get my attention. No 1 liners. I will send a picture back. Thank you for reading this and have a wonderful day.

Howdy, CL.
I am hoping there is a young (or young at heart) man out there interested in watching the six nations games this saturday with a new friend. Any easy going, calm, but interested soul is welcome to message me. 

The games are being broadcast on BBC now, so it should not be impossible to find somewhere playing it, or even to watch at home. While I support Fado and other bars downtown playing the games I am not willing to fight my way into and out of SXSW crowds to get there. 

Along the same line, if you are hosting a big party, then sorry, I just don't have the fortitude to meet and party with your whole team. (for you active players in Austin) 

It would be super if you had interests outside of the pitch so we could talk between games, but if you got hit in the head playing a few too many times I guess I'll still be your friend...

I look forward to meeting you, and to everyone out there be safe. Saturday is a rugby day!

Not to be off-puting, but it bears re-itterating, I am just looking for a rugby watching buddy, not a f*buddy. Thanks!

I am single, short, 33, educated, sarcastic, attractive, curvy (actual curvy, not a 0-6), and bi sexual. I have hundreds of interest that revolve around living in this amazing place. Will go into detail later.

Would like to meet someone attractive, NOT married, and definitely with a sense of humor. For a meeting and potential fun time later on if we click. No one nighters though.?
Colorado natives get bonus points.
Can't rule out fun, but meeting and talking are a must. FRIENDS with benefits would be nice. Something consistent with someone you get along with and can just hang out with. Crazy concept huh?

Going back to the bisexual part. I'm very interested in women also. Basically I'm poly, and I would need a woman in my life at some point too. Either my own gf or a shared gf. Need someone interested, and or ok with that. Please don't email me just because you think it's hot.

I cannot host, but not because I'm married/attached. If you're old enough to be my father, I wouldn't be interested.

So I'm looking for someone local that wants to toke up and chill. It would be great if that person lives in Gardner so they're on my way home from work. I do work semi late 9:30pm the latest. It would also be nice to establish a relationship of some nature. So essentially I'm not looking for just a hookup. But that could be a possibility it's not off the table. We would have to click in order for that to occur. I want someone I can talk to and relax with. It would be nice to have someone I can cuddle with on the couch and smoke with :) I'm 30 and a bbw but I'm cute! You should be around 30-50.

Being single has become like a job than anything. It is time consuming, full of let downs, feels like an interview most of the time. Why and when has it gotten this way? What happen to simple dating You know, where you have a nice dinner, talk, go for a walk afterwards, hold hands and get to know each other? We have put so many restrictions on what we want and what we will accept. If you have fun with someone, if you enjoy their company, then why not take it further and see what happens? 

My situation is a little different. I have met some ok people on here, I am just not in a position to take over and financially or mentally take care of them fully. Finances take a huge toll on relationships and if it is a struggle from the beginning, the relationship is doomed to fail. I do not mind paying for dates, but it would be nice once in a blue moon, for the man to pay. 

If you are hung up on your past, please seek help before trying to pursue a relationship. Again, unhealthy to bring all your demons into a fresh relationship. 

I am a financially sound professional female who is ready to enjoy the simple things in life. I love the outdoors, staying in, catching a movie, cooking dinner, going to outdoor concerts and many other things. I am open to adventure. I am flexible and I am willing to try anything that interests you. I am a hopeless romantic. The more romantic the better. 

I am also very sexual and I enjoy the touch of a wonderful man. 

I promise to tell you more if we click. If you are reading this on this cold Friday morning, I hope to hear from you.

We live in a world that is full of hate, that is judgmental, and selfish. We try to live a life that is only seen on television, or in fairy tales. We all have an image of who the perfect person for us would be. While we have that image we tend to shut out anyone that is less that perfect. I feel that we don't give enough chances to the ones that we are so quick to judge as not being good enough. I feel that we are sheltering ourselves from really experiencing what true love and happiness is. We tend to be caught up on looks, height, weight, one's income, that we forget to dig deeper and learn who the person really is. We are so into stereotypes that it is closing us off from the real world.

With all that being said, I am going to tell you what I am looking to find. I am looking for the person that makes me laugh, the one that leaves a permanent smile on my heart. Someone adventurous, kind, selfless, family oriented, goal oriented, open minded, out going and sincere.

I myself am very selfless, I am goal oriented, career minded, outgoing, giving, responsible, non judgmental, family oriented, and I give 100% to everything I do. I also attend church. I know that is not for everybody, so I would never force it on you.

Life is tough enough just trying to make it through, so why are we making it tougher by putting labels on everyone.

I love what I do and do what I love.

If you would like to chat and learn more about each other, send me an email and we can go from there.

*Please don't message if you ARE NOT interested in something long term. We are looking for something long term! A relationship between the 3 of us. A triad relationship. 

Here is a little bit about us and what we are looking for.

We are 31 and are looking for someone +/- 5 years from our age.

He is bisexual. So we are looking for another bi male. A male who is a little on the submissive side. Not so much sexually, just in general as we are both have pretty dominate personalities. But he would prefer a top, or at least someone who is orally bi. We have experimented a little with MMF threesomes and it was just ok. 
The woman in the relationship is more interested in developing an emotional connection/relationship with this third person. While she is very sexual, having multiple sexual partners isn't something she wants. We both want one person who we can trust and develop a relationship with. Just as if we were in a monogamous relationship. We both have a lot to offer in a relationship and have needs that need to be met as well.

We do have kids, so you must be ok with that. In the future, we would like to add this person to our household if that is something everyone is ok with when that time comes. We also have a business(s) that we run. Both kids and business are why we want to find a trustworthy, decent person. We are completely STD free and you need to be too!

About us? We are both physically very attractive. Mixed races, but different mixes. We both have hobbies. Different. She enjoys fine arts, MUSIC, (must have similar music taste!) concerts, fine dining and wine, hiking and just being active. He is somewhat of an adrenaline junkie. Anything active and fast.

She is 5'6"". About 135 pounds. Dark hair, green eyes. Very physically in shape. He is 5'6"" as well. Dark hair, dark eyes. In excellent physical shape also. We will send pictures.

Please put ""relationship"" in the subject like and include a G rated picture of yourself. Thank you!

I am looking for someone unique, wanting to have a real lady, someone who enjoys dinner by the fire or a walk by the lake. I want someone I can laugh with, cry with and be real with. Always wanted to live in a log cabin in the mountains, a stream, the beautiful sunsets. If we have to grow old, we might as well do it with class, right?
I enjoy dancing, cooking and movies that end with a tissue and an Aww. A glass of wine or a ice cream cone, an old mountain town, a walk in the park. A drive through the many winding roads through the mountains, on a clear night with the top down and counting the stars. I enjoy auctions, garage sales, and home shows. Grocery shopping late at night, so you can shop with no one around. Blue Jeans or that little black dress, heals or flats, spur of the moment decisions that take you away to a new memory that stays with you always. You only live once you know.
I would love to meet a tall, fit, white Christian male, in his 50's, that is looking to spoil me with his chivalry and time. I love to laugh and would enjoy getting to know someone first, you know, see if there is a spark. If not, friendship is always an option.
Please no nudies photos, as I will not respond. Send me a picture of yourself, a little about what you enjoy, and a town you love to visit in Colorado in the subject line.
Hope to hear from you soon. Take Care

I need to feel safe and spoiled all while being in your arms. The need to get out and about on the town and into the world, burns within me. Curling up at home and enjoying a blizzard together is wonderful too. Having more children would be great. However, I already have one. So, that is not a deal breaker. 

Love and care for me and I will do the same for you. Let's enjoy and live life. You picture will get mine or at least a ""no thank you"".

I am a pretty straight forward person and I am not a huge fan being coy or doing the ""mysterious, mixed signal"" stuff. With that being said, I am not looking for a partner who displays the latter. We are both adults.

I work and like to travel when I can. I am not a girly girl, so if you like high maintenance, six inche stilettos, and a pundit of make up...you are reading the wrong ad. I don't mind getting dirty or working hard. Can I dress up, yes, but I like casual as well.

I have a best friend that is a guy. You have to be ok with that. I love to read and can get pretty ""holed up"" with a good book. I also love to catch a good movie (Marvel movies are awesome). Long walks sound like bullshit, but I do love those as well.

I am one of those BBW people and I personally love the older stocky, tall men. I heard some call it the ""Dad Body"". More to love on both ends, lol. I am not really attracted to thin or overly athletic men. Consequently, I have to state that I like men with good hygiene. I am also black.

I would love to go on, but I don't someone's eyes to cross. Change the subject to your location (preferably in North Denver) and include a pic. Some info about you wouldn't hurt.

I am pretty good with stating whether I am interested or not, but if I don't get back to you, I am not interested. Be an adult and move on gracefully.

I believe the best relationships develop out of friendship and evolve into much more. So, let's start with friendship. No expectations; no drama. No matter how we dice it, the end result is a happy one. . ..we either have a great relationship and/or a great friendship! 

Given that a relationship is a possibility, you must be single. Truly single (rather than separated, semi-divorced, or any other option). Drugs, excessive alcohol, and smoking are absolute deal-killers for me.

I'm educated, inquisitive, and am really happy with my life. I have a love of reading, and I am beginning to explore the outdoors more. Traveling is definitely in the plans. I'm tall.

I am seeking a man and one man only who is of legal age and of any race who is comfortable with his own intelligence, sense of humor and who desires a woman who can hold her own in a conversation, yet does not dominate it.
A good listener, in other words.
I am also seeking a man that knows what he wants, knows what a lady wants and someone that is not into mental games.
A man who is open minded, intelligent, mildly irreverent, insightful and not afraid of emotional intimacy.
A man that is creative, fun in the bedroom but can also hold a conversation outside of the bedroom is highly preferred.
I'm also seeking a man who can financially assist me as I do have a very controlling husband. 
Maintaining your privacy and mine are off importance.
A man whose drug and disease free is an absolute must.
I'm not into head games.
I'm only into sexually and sensual sinister games.
I'm a one of a kind woman and a lover of life.
I have many long time friends near and far that make up my world.
I value fun, laughter and stimulating conversation.
My daily mindfulness practice continues to remind me that every moment is perfect and overflowing with joy and serenity.
I appreciate connecting with true friends.
I am compassionate and grounded and I delight in the joy that is revealed in which I express sincere appreciation and pleasure.
So, in some ways, I am not terribly particular about a friend, lover and companion.
On the other hand, I am particular in that I am basically looking for one thing, a connection.
You may call it chemistry on every level, physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual.
So in summary, I am not hard to please but at the same time I am a bit picky.
I have acquired much in my lifetime but have recently begun a quest to downsize and simplify as much as possible.

age: 34

I feel like trying to find someone these days is like filling out a job application. It's tough when you're a single mom and you want to find your forever. So here's my shot. 
I'm 33 years old. I don't know my natural hair color anymore because I get bored with it and try new colors all the time. Right now it's dark purple. I have blue eyes and I'm about 5'7"". I'm not a skinny twig and I'm ok with that - although I am working on getting into better shape. I am a mom of 3 who has little help from the dad. I have a really good job, a car, a house - just missing the other part of me.
I am looking for a man - not a boy - who is willing to take on this single mom and her kiddos. Although I'm in the springs, I would relocate for the right guy. My job is flexible like that :) I prefer a more dominant guy - I'm old fashioned that way. But dominant does not mean jerk. I want a man that will change the oil in my car (or take it to get it done), someone who mows the lawn while I'm making lunch, does the ""guy"" things while I do the ""gal"" things - a true partnership. I know I know a little old fashioned I'm just saying it should be 50-50. Ok enough rambling :) if I haven't scared you off yet hit me up. I'm not a shallow person but attraction is important so if you would please include a picture. And don't be married or dating or with someone - I'm not going into something fwb or one night standish. I love the fun stuff a lot too (I am super affectionate) but I want the whole kit and caboodle

I'm looking for lightning to strike twice. I had a great relationship with a wonderful man, but he passed away 18 months ago. I don't know if it is possible to find another wonderful man, but I think it is time to try. I miss cuddling, I miss having someone to talk to. I miss the sharing that comes with being in a committed relationship. I miss the intimacy (in all it's forms). I'm hoping there is someone out there that is looking for that too.

I'm 32 year old teacher, and I don't have any kids (just two kitties) but I want them and I have no problem if you do. I'm not looking for a one-night stand, I want something lasting that grows. 

Two things that might be deal breakers about me. I want to be honest because if these bother you, why waste my time and yours. First, I am a big girl. I am working on it, but losing a spouse is hard. Some people drink, some turn to other things, my source of solace was food. I have moved past that, and I am on my way to a much healthier (and smaller) place, but if you can't deal with someone who is larger, then please move on. Second, I live with my mother. She moved in with my husband and I because she is getting older and I didn't want her living alone. I am in no way dependent on her, but this bothers some people. We are a package deal, so if you are one of those people, please move along. I personally believe that family is supposed to take care of each other, and I am looking for someone who feels that same way.

Now for the good things. I am a nerd who loves to read and play video games. I volunteer at Comicon and I love the Zombie Crawl. I love playing games; card games, board games and especially poker. I love camping, fishing, and driving in the mountains. I love to travel, and I have a lot of places I want to see. I love the Broncos and the Rockies. I would like to get into playing softball and I plan on taking up martial arts as well. I have a lot of things to offer the right person. If you are out there, please respond back with your favorite Super Hero. I can't wait to meet you.

I met the coolest guy on CL recently, unfortunately he's been relocated to another city. He was working in town weekly, so didn't have friends/family here. Was just looking for someone to go out to dinners and hang out with. The third time we met up, he invited me to stay at his hotel for the night. We hung out in bed, watched movies and went to sleep. No kissing, no inappropriate touching, just someone to sleep next to. It was shocking to meet someone with manners who knew what platonic really meant, and I know my hope of finding the same again is not likely, but what the hell.

I'm a single woman with no kids and live in central Denver. I have a fair amount of free time right now on weekends mostly, but the busy season at work is likely starting soon. I'm independent, sarcastic, curious and pretty damn smart as well. I'm about 25 pounds above average weight for my height, but looking for someone who likes to get out for walks is good as well. The weather has been so great so far this year and I'd love someone who likes to get out Saturdays or Sunday mornings for coffee and a walk. I like live music, movies, traveling and good food and wine as well.

I know the chance of meeting Mr. Right (not sure there's such a thing) in this ad is unlikely, so I'd settle for a great friend. Please do be 40-50 years old. 39 is okay and 51 is okay, but not 27 or 56. Had to be specific as I had all the young dudes answering.

Emails that say hello, are you still looking or other one liners will NOT be answered. Please tell me something about yourself and what prompted you to answer my ad. Please send a picture as there has to be some attraction. I'm not looking to meet up immediately, would like to get to know you first.

Want to spice up your night? Missing something from the current situation you are in? Or maybe you are not in a relationship and just really need some special attention. I offer you a companion experience and/or girl friend experience. You don't even have to take me to dinner and a movie. If you want to move right in to the physical part lets do it. I am open to a lot of things, just ask. All I ask is that you leave me some roses at the end of the night, or the next morning if we decide that. Please contact me with specific details on what each one of us wants.

35, BBW, Brown hair, hazel eyes, looks innocent, but is very deviant. Do not let my body type or age deter you. I love to have fun and have a very open mind. Will be in the Denver area over the weekend and need the company. You host or I can.

I will not send you to any websites to put in CC numbers or look at my cam. I am a real person. It snowed today through much of northern Colorado and it's the middle of spring. Oh yeah, and Rockies home opener is next Friday 4/8/16.

Single BBW mid 40's East Asian (Chinese), seeks something casual, no pressure, and fun, ongoing and consistent. Seeking a fun and easy going companion to meet a few times a month for dinners, movies, events...etc. and just enjoy each other's company without the commitment and stigma of a ""relationship"", someone to have fun with IN and OUT of the bedroom.

Seeking a clean cut well established professional male, someone who might be too busy with his career and doesn't have the time to invest in a traditional relationship/GF, yet misses the companionship of one without the pressure to commit. A Caucasian or Asian male his 30's-50, DDF, non-smoker and prefer someone who resides in Manhattan alone and able to host or willing to get a hotel. I am very sexual and prefer someone who is as well to explore with. I am also open to a Businessman who frequents NYC and seek some company during his stays. 

I have found myself falling behind on certain aspects in my life and hoping to find someone who is generous and open minded to an arrangement, a helpful friend. 

If this piques you interest, please contact me with some information about you and if there is a connection we meet for a simple, low-pressure drink/coffee and see where things goes.

Having been through and in the process of going through some difficult times, I am looking to continue and move forward in a positive way. I am recently single and I would love to get to know someone who has a similar goal in mind. I'm liberal in many ways but always open to and curious about the other sides of a given argument. I am creatively inclined but just as curious about people who are curious about other things. I'm loyal to the people in my life and want to bring positive energy, fun as well as practical aspects to peoples lives and would love to meet someone committed to the same. While I'm curious about you and your life situation, I am much more interested in who you are than where you are if that makes sense. Feel free to drop me a line if you can relate to this post or if it intrigues you in any way. And feel free to ask me anything. I hope you're having a good day and staying warm. Old man winter is haunting us for sure. Haha.

I am interested in LTR with a strong, dominant, confident man between 40 & 55. You are single, emotionally available and stable. You are not going to send me a one liner or vulgar email because you're better than that.

5'4"", in good shape, aging very well because I put effort into it, so do you. Dark brown hair, dark blue eyes, professional, very selective, so are you, intelligent yet silly. I think the Ted movies are hilarious. I'm low maintenance about most things but not men. I know what I want and will not settle. 

I am an animal lover, liberal, tolerant, spiritual not religious, love the water, enjoy time with friends and many other things. 

We respect each other and understand that life is better together.

I understand that not everyone is attracted to everyone else. That's why we have preferences...because we know what we like and that is OKAY. I'm looking for a sweet gentleman (a gentleman being a man who knows how to treat a woman like a lady) who enjoys conversation, over 5' 9"", doesn't smoke, and is D/D free. Everything else is negotiable! lol

I have long dark brown hair, hazel eyes, a laid back/kind disposition, I believe wholeheartedly in monogamy and honesty (from both sides!) I am happy with my life (have job, apartment, car, etc.) but I am missing that someone fun to enjoy my happy life WITH. I want to share my happiness, and my love, with someone truly kind. Oh, back to preferences mattering....I am a bbw so if that is not for you then please don't write to me. 

Thanks for reading and I can't wait to hear from you! ~R~
