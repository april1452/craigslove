Older Southern gentleman, lifelong bachelor; I have had many beautiful girl friends over the years who all would say I have NEVER cheated on a girlfriend in my life. Moral compass. 

A little bit of a nutrition and fitness nut. I am 6'2"", the same weight 180 lbs., and body I was when I tried out for the corner at an elite college football program at age 19 (pic after football camp attached). I can out last most guys in their 30's. Girl trainers, fitness models, and nutrition nuts follow me on Pinterest and Twitter. Women my age BORE me; I would rather be alone than be with someone I have no interest in.

I have been ""Discrete Friend"" to girls 19 to 28 or at least have 4 in the past 10 years who have also become BEST FRIENDS. My latest, from when she was 19 to 22, graduated last June and teaching abroad while working on her Masters in Spanish. Our planned graduation left me with an empty heart.

I met her when she saw me giving an investment presentation. She began calling and asking questions, odd for a 19-year-old, but I was nice and patient as she called just to chat. 

I became her virtual lover. . . during the day she would text, call, email. . . like lovers do and every night for over 2 years I told her a bedtime story. 

Simply seek to be close with a girl who has not yet lost her sense of wonder and wants a man to talk to who only seeks her happiness. Tell her a bedtime story every night to assure her Sweet Dreams.

Honestly, you location doesn't really matter, it is what is inside that counts. But, I am quirky, and I am okay with that and hope you are too. I like things in common and age within 5 years. Nothing wrong with wanting someone to correspond with that has your same interests. Here are the things I would like to talk about with a penpal:

1. You are single, I am as well. I don't want to disrespect anyone involved. Around my age range, within 5 years.
2. Love of the outdoors, nothing better than being with Mother Nature and loving a ski trip, a run, a bike, a hike, a kayak, a boat, anything outside.
3. A good drink, a night by the fire with a good wine or a great beer is good.
4. A superhero outfit, you never know when you will need one.
5. A good education and a good job. This is one of the things I value in my life that is up on the top. Prob #3.
6. Enjoying the moment.
7. Random yard ornaments. Gazing balls, solar lights, bird baths, shiny things are so darn cool.
8. Random thoughts and acts of kindness, 4 out of 5 voices in my head told me to post this. 
9. A getaway car. 
10. I am not looking for a meetup. That's why I posted in strictly platonic. No pics are necessary, just a like mind.
11. Eleven is from heaven, tell me about yourself. I won't respond to a ""Hello"" especially after I spent the time to create this post.

Let me know your superhero outfit!

Hi there, =) 
I am a 23 yr old lesbian looking for friends in the area. I've been in the area for three years now. Right now I'm in the process of self improving and have decided that not being in a relationship is detrimental to the process. I just left a 2 yr relationship and was very distraught doing so but it was do to my personal failings. Thankfully we are still friends and have a ton of love for each other. Right now she is my only friend in Colorado. I think it would be healthy for me to branch out and know more people during this transition in life.

I've always had great expectations for myself and won't be happy until I feel fulfilled. I want that lust for life and hopefully I meet like minded people. 
I've lived a dangerous and unpredictable life but that's behind me (thankfully). I'm striving to be the best self I can. 
Now with that being said, I work a lot and wouldn't be around all of the time but I keep an open ear for friends and am not that far away. I'm pretty political for the most part. Stong opinions but not pushy. I'm into everything outdoors. Can't say I'm very good for shopping. Movies are OK but not usually entertaining, more of a documentary kind of girl. I'm seriously level headed so if you need a grounder, I'm your gal. Don't think I'm super bland, I've got whit to boot ;) can be a complete riot.

t has been said that the whole is more than the sum of it's parts. Synergism is what I desire in a personal relationship with a woman. I wish to be more than a stunted part of a stale entity. I see each of us as a cracking element of a synergistic event. Somewhere there is such a woman worthy of both my trust and admiration. I have dedicated my life to be such a man, capable of lending my strength and honoring that which is best between us. A man is made of many thing's, none of which can be seen at a glance.

I am incarcerated, there will be obstacles and challenges to negotiate. ""Never judge a book by it's cover,"", I'm sure you've heard that before, and what would life be like for us if we were all to scared to explore?

I am spirited, there will be adventure and excitement to endure. And I am passionate, there is hope and a high regard for matters of the heart. But tomorrow I see change, a chance to build anew. Built on spirit, intent of heart and ideals based on truth. It's only a moment of your time, email me and you will be sent ways to contact me directly.

So it seems in my experience that women only talk about wanting a decent guy. The reality is they end up with the opposite. I'm hoping that I'm wrong and I guess I will find out. I would really like to meet a woman that appreciates nice guys whether it's as friends or more. I'm 35 brown hair and eyes and 200lbs. I have a pic i will send. I play a lot of hockey so that keeps me in shape. Write me back and lets grab a drink and just have a fun night out. The worst that can happen is we each make a new friend.

I am married, so yes this is platonic. Unlike most of the females posting ads, platonic doesnt mean give me free stuff or romantic relationship at my convenience.

I just want to dance with a friend and sadly hollywoods lied to me saying all women love dancing and all straight men hate it.

Tired of going alone, and tired of drink ho's asking for drinks, its been a while but one can never be UN-tired of drink hos.

I do possess a mohawk, and I workout so Im fit. Still trying to lose those last 10lbs, but there isnt a workout for my overly inflated ego. Yeah, totally take myself seriously. :-).

Im also available for coffee houses! I like chai

Since its come to my attention that theres crazies and Im supposed to be terrified of the internet Ive taken my pics down. Also, since the female platonic ads are rife with Pic or no reply....guess I get to join ya and demand a pic before I reply. Supposedly its to know who Im talking to, but I really dont want a pic of you I just want something funny.

Hello, new CL bestie!! I'm new to the 30's (just turned last month) and am looking for a kick-ass girl to get to know. I'm huge into music and would be awesome to find someone to attend some local shows with. Not your typical Coloradan, as in I don't get down with the 420 and I would mind if you do! Just not anything I care to partake in, and would appreciate the same. As far as drinking goes, have at it! Haha 

I love watching Netflix and chillin on the weekends, even a lot during the week. Going out ALL. THE. TIME. is just overrated and SO expensive. I like home-cooked dinner and watching tv, or just having great conversation and then grabbing some dessert and walking afterwards. I work a M-F job that I love and that allows me to have tons of fun (just bought a new car!!). 

Would be great to find a cute girl to go hang out and just have fun with. I'm all for if you're a healthy eater, as I would love to get in a little better shape (I mean, me being 'fat' is 6', 200 and running 3-4 miles a day! Haha) I'm an advocate of working out, but really don't care if you do. Would love someone that can go grab Mickie D's with me for dinner on a random Wednesday night! All in all, just looking for a fun girl that would enjoy the company of a fun guy! :) Someone that can and will talk about anything, from sex to movies to the idiocy of politics and religion (and if you're a fan of those, I'm very respectful and will value your opinions! :), and everything in between!!

Ask away with any questions you have, and please be a good conversationalist; nothing kills a friendship boner quicker than poor communication skills. Haha And I would like if you sent a photo, as I will do so in return. I hope you enjoyed my random novel, and have a great day! :D

I'm not looking for people who dwell in drama or are always out of weed and just looking to get smoked up, although if you're out... Help is never far away ;) 

I'm also always looking for more shatter smokers... let me know, give me a call or text and you have a new friend to smoke with...

I'm posting this ad in the hopes of finding some new couples to spend time with, who aren't flaky and have the ability to commit to making plans ahead of time without always canceling at the last minute! I'm sure if you're taking the time to read this ad, you probably have friends like this - the kind who always complain about how they're bored and want to do stuff, but as soon as you propose doing something they're ""busy"" or ""can't go."" As you get older you realize you don't have the time or energy to constantly be the only side of the relationship putting in effort when it comes to spending time together. Therefore, if you are also a couple that wants to make new friends that are actually up for DOING things, let's talk! My husband and I live outside of Colorado Springs, but coming from the East Coast where it takes an hour to drive 15 miles on most days, driving doesn't bother either of us. Plus I figure that everyone here drives into the mountains throughout the year, so what's the difference in a one hour drive between the Springs and Denver suburbs if you have friends you want to spend time with?

One of the biggest reasons we moved to Colorado was to be able to enjoy the outdoors, so we want to meet other people who like to be outside and want to go hiking or visit new places on a semi-regular basis. We try to go hiking every weekend (though it's more low key now that it's colder), and I have a whole list of places I want to go in/around Colorado Springs and the rest of the state. Last summer we did a lot of hiking up off 70, climbed Quandary Peak and made our way out towards Aspen. We want to get down to the Sand Dunes and spend some time in Crested Butte this summer to see the wildflowers.

We have an awesome dog so if you like animals that's a plus. We adopted her over the summer and she loves trails, so she usually comes with us when we go hiking - unless of course it's somewhere dogs aren't allowed, we don't just bring her to be tools. Finding a couple with a dog that also wants to get out and explore would be great, but you don't have to have a dog as long as you don't hate them or something. 

My husband loves football, video/computer games (what dude doesn't?) and is in the process of getting his Masters degree. We both have hard science degrees, love to travel and do not smoke (anything). We don't have kids, and are looking for people in the same boat. 

If anything about this sounds familiar to you, feel free to shoot me an email so we can chat some more! I really hope there are some people out there who are in the same boat - there is too much cool stuff to do around here to sit inside and not get out and see it!

What if working out and proper nutrition was more than just a Means to
lose weight and get into shape?

What if it was a catalyst to shifting your life?

In my years as a trainer I have noticed one amazing thing about
purposeful movement and good nutrition. It gives people to confidence
to do amazing things with their lives!

People step up into better engagement in their jobs, relationships, in their lives!
Of course a healthier body shows up along for the ride, but are you ready to really shift your life?

How about a complementary exploratory session to see what is possible?

Mid-thirties man looking for friends. Someone to exercise with, hike with, grab a beer and talk about our week, other casual stuff not presently at the forefront of my mind. 

I'm in a happy relationship, just don't have many friends. Prefer women over men because they actually listen when you talk and don't tend to let their egos get in the way of an honest conversation.

Addendum. Strictly platonic people ! Google it if you don't know what that means. I get plenty of attention and affection and I don't need a cuddle buddy. I'm lolling for friends to chill with, grab a beer, whatever is in the realm of platonic, nothing more. Jesus Christ!

Hi there. My name is Rob. I used to live in Denver several years ago and now I'm returning for a visit from 3/8 to 3/13. I live in Ohio currently and just can't seem to find a woman here who I like. I would like to meet a white woman in Denver for some fun and travel in CO. I am extremely attracted to both red heads and women with dark features. But if you don't fit into that category, please don't worry about it. I am pretty flexible with age. I would say anywhere from 25 - 43 is fine. I am really NOT into women with kids though. However, if I met the right woman, I'd like to have kids with her one day. 

I would really like someone to connect with more than anything else. I'm a good guy with a little bit of a wild streak, fun, articulate, and will talk about anything under the sun with you. I like to hike, fish, go white water rafting, go to the breweries, and have a very strong interest in holistic and metaphysical things. But at the same time I am also very grounded. I just got a new job in the IT field that I am starting right after I return home. In the meantime, this is my time for fun and adventure! And I would love to hang out with someone fun, who is kind, warm, caring, affectionate, grounded and who I can relate to and talk with easily.

I have tickets for the Blackhawks vs Avalanche hockey game on new years eve and I'm looking for a date. The game is at 6 pm, we'll get a good buzz going at the game and then continue drinking and partying downtown. 

I like to have a good time so don't be a Debbie downer. I'm 28, 5'11, muscular build, clean cut not into 420 tonight but have no problem with it. I have my friend M and great bars afterwards.

Do you have a desire to feel more at ease with life, no matter what is going on?

Having your Bars run can do just that. There are 32 points on your head that correspond to things like; healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named.

They store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything.

For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called ""money.""

Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it, clearing the space for new awareness to come in.

The creative possibilities for your life begin to open up!

It's been said that at worst a Bars session will feel like a great massage. At best, it will change your life!

That title is right to the point. I'm a Denver native, but it's time for some new faces. I figured I'd give this a try, maybe there are some other cool people looking for the same thing. I'm really looking for people who like going out drinking, to rock shows, and smoking/dabbing until they pass out. Not about the conservative gun loving types.

Hello! 

I am looking to find some people more my speed. I don't have too many friends because I have and older soul and it is hard to befriend girls my age. We just have different goals I think. I am looking for someone to make crafts with, read books, get coffee, shop, and maybe take walks/hikes or exercise classes. 

A little about me ; 31 yrs old, never married but i have a bf. I have a 12 yr old son (full custody) I don't smoke or do drugs. I do drink occasionally. Getting together to craft and drink a bottle of wine sounds Amazing to me!!!! I have a dog. I like to read, watch movies, hang out with my son. Right now I am deeply into learning different things to sew. I'm new so learning to not break my machine! Other crafts im learning is making stained glass, glass etching, mosaics, candles, painting wooden projects. Those are just what I have in my closet right now. Mainly just sewing at the moment. I would love to find someone similar in interest. I dont care your age race or occupation. I am looking for a genuine friend to spend time with, learn from and help learn.

I'm a very honest person and am looking for the same. I'm very open minded on things. I like to go out, enjoy the weather, love movies, playing golf, tennis, pool among many other things. I've became somewhat of a foodie and like to try and enjoy fine dining. I'm 420 friendly, rarely drink.

First off..a message to the guys who will send me an email. I'm not interested!!! I don't have problems finding men in real life. And since you'll ask anyway I'll save you the time. I'm 34f . 


So hoping to find a PIC or BFF. So I'm new to the area and def need some girl time. I am looking for a friend or friends that love to go out and enjoy life. Preferably love to go dancing, shopping, clubbing, bar hopping. Basically living it up as young 20's year olds. 

I prefer that you're single because from past experience it just isn't the same when going out with a girl in a relationship. I need somebody that will watch my back as I watch hers. 

Somebody that is non judgemental. Somebody that if I leave with a guy at the bar/club will be calling me up the next day to see how great it was and not judging me by giving me a hard time. 

I love to dress to impress. I wear a lot of halter tops that tend to show cleavage. I also wear leggings a lot that make the booty stick out lol. So if you don't want to be around that we probably won't get along. Would be awesome if you're on the same page so I'm not alone lol

I listen to mostly hip hop and rap r n b. Prefer stuff with a good beat and can dance too.

I smoke and drink. I do like 420 but not a big deal if you're not into it BUT I do smoke cigs. 

Please when responding lemme know your favorite stores to shop in, music taste, types of guys you're into. And anything else you're into.

I don't know exactly what I'm looking for. Maybe just a fresh new connection outside of my little circle. The truth is I don't get out much anymore to meet anyone. I work a full time career with a very demanding schedule. I have two kids and I make enough to thankfully support my wife being a stay at home mother. I'm 29 years old and bored sick. I'm so tired of the monotonous same old same old. I'm not looking for love, my wife fulfills me in that aspect. Hence the strictly platonic posting. I'm looking for someone like me. Maybe a new best friend. Someone that intrigues me. I'm not easily impressed but maybe you can impress me? As for me, I'm one of those ""intellectual"" types. Not really geeky although I could nerd out on a few things. I speak very open and honestly which some people find a little blunt. Yes I can be blunt. Brutal. But very honest.

So, I really need some perspective right now. My dating life has been strange lately. I don't do online dating, won't date girls from work and pretty much only hang out in my neighborhood. I also try not to mess around with girls in my neighborhood. I do meet girls, usually randoms that are I meet somewhere out in my neighborhood. That is usually either a straight hookup or very short term. 
Well, I met this girl last week at my regular bar recently. I had never seen her in there and she is one of those girls you would notice but she claims she goes in there and does live around there. We hit off but it was just great conversation. She showed up a few days later and actually told me she wanted to run into me and was surprised I didn't ask for her number last time. Again, it was a great time. She has a complicated life. She works and has a young child. So, from what she told me, she is very hesitant when it comes to guys. We made a plan for a proper date and have been texting daily ever since. 
So, this morning I responded to the last text she sent last night. I fell asleep early and it seemed like she was seeing if I was out or at home. I didn't get a response so just asked if she was having a busy day. She text back saying yes and it hasn't been a great day. I was consoling and said I wish I could meet her but I'm not off for a couple of hours. She said she had something to tell me. That's never good. She said she went out last night, to that neighborhood bar and ended up hooking up with someone. She feels horrible about it because that's not her and she really likes me. She just had a rough day at work and things went further than she wanted with drinking and that guy. She also said she understands if I don't want to talk to her anymore because I probably know the guy. 
So, I don't know what to think. I have my history. I was with someone for a random hookup the week before I met her but I think that situation is different. Considering we kissed, I'm imagining ""hooking up"" meant they had sex. She's been very clear about me having to be patient with her and I was willing. From our talks, I think she is finally over things with her ex and wanting to date someone. I liked the way she has been with me, really like her and we connect well. It's bad enough that her actions contradict what she has told me but even worse that I probably know the guy. I'm glad she was honest though. I guess that counts for something. 
So, please share some advice or thoughts with me. It's difficult because of how I mentioned my dating life is and I do honestly feel we had a great connection. Is there a way to get over this?

I figured I'd give this a try since I've had surprisingly amazing luck on Craigslist before so here goes nothing:

I'm a 25 yo female looking for female friends on Craigslist. I know it's kind of a weird concept, but I've been in CO for 3 years for graduate school and now that that's done, most of my friends have moved away and I find myself in serious need of a female friend.

About me: I'm 25, in a serious relationship, have a cat and work a full time 8-5 M-F job. I'm open minded, friendly, trustworthy, a good listener, 420 friendly and I drink occasionally (nothing sloppy though lol). I like reading, traveling, watching TV and movies, going out to new bars and restaurants, and music (going to live shows, listening to music on my iPhone, etc). I'm also starting to get into more outdoorsy things like fishing, camping, hiking, etc too.

What I'm looking for in a friend: Someone with similar personality traits who would like to do similar things. I would love someone to go out with on the weekends, or just chill low-key. Someone who's into doing some girly stuff would also be a plus. I like getting my nails and hair done every once in awhile and some company would be nice since my b/f has no interest in doing those things with me (surprise, surprise haha). Some who is an animal lover (or at least tolerant of animals) would also be a plus since I have a super friendly cat that'll want nothing more than to love the hell outta you. 

So if you've read this and think we'd be a fit as friends email me and attach a picture and we'll see what happens!

Obviously with the exposure given by media and gotten by celebrity, the idea of exposing one's leg or breast is still something participated in throughout society.

However, what about the every-day-person who is also ready, willing and able to participate in such activities? The possibilities are significantly less apparent! For those who enjoy a bit of the ""risqué"", there is the fine art of ""flashing"". It happens every Friday on Craigslist, right?

Hello,

I'm a 32 year guy who has had a weird last few years, taking me out of my element, and putting me in a position of being more introverted than my normal self (I can explain all of this in detail in person). As I come out of this period in my life, I'm finding my social skills to be a little rusty, and I want to find someone to talk to, especially about dating. I haven't had any problems with dating, per se, but I feel I'm not seeing the results I'd like to lately, and would love to get some outside perspective.

A little about me: I own a small business, very physically active, love gardening & cooking, and overall a caring, open, and passionate person. Additionally, I live in Boulder. The reason I'm posting in the Denver group is because it's more active than the Boulder group, and feel I'll find more diverse perspectives here. Meeting in Denver would be easiest for me, though I meet in other areas that are conveniently accessed with public transportation, or via bicycle. 

On a final note: I've been told I'm a very good listener, and this wouldn't be a one-way street. If you need to talk about anything in your life, I'd love to listen and help.

Settling in town, don't have that big a circle of friends and thought this wouldn't hurt. I have been told to be quite attractive, fun, and intelligent (know the difference between their, there and they're lol).

In my 20's, tall, come from a diverse background, Handsome and in great shape, high sex drive and just really enjoy the company of an attractive female. 

No specific type on my end, just be in shape, fun to talk to and good company. Fair enough?
I know there's gotta be normal people on here who are looking for the same lol, I'm sure I'm not the only one.

Also, I realized I'm not exactly sure what I'm wanting so keeping an open mind. I hope you would too... If we just end up being good friends, I'm happy with that. FWB? Sure. maybe something more or something less....

And then move to meeting when the time feels right. Do you want that kind of relationship back again? I do. So let's give it a try.

I am married, and it's fine if you are too. Basically, we're roommates, and I know for certain she's had some outside relationships. I can't really change things right now, so my thought is why not make someone happy, and find fulfillment and excitement outside, as long as nobody gets hurt?

Having been involved in athletics and personal training for 30+ years,
I've achieved a lot of my personal targets around athletics and my body.
I've been stuck on the couch and shifted back into movement all the while thinking I don't have the time to exercise or eat right.

I've learned what really created the shifts for me to be able to achieve these targets I had for myself. It isn't the work or effort I put into it, it wasn't forcing discipline or faking that having patience was fine. It was a shift in how I was choosing to think. How I think about the target itself and how I think about the journey vs the end goal.

I can show you this, build a plan for you around your exercise, nutrition and the mindfulness habits to support and get you to your targets!

Would you be interested in a complimentary 30 minute discovery session to see what is possible for you, and if we can build this plan together to achieve your targets?

Do you have a desire to feel more at ease with life, no matter what is going on?

Having your Bars run can do just that. There are 32 points on your head that correspond to things like; healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named.

They store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything.

For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called ""money.""

Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it, clearing the space for new awareness to come in.

The creative possibilities for your life begin to open up!

It's been said that at worst a Bars session will feel like a great massage. At best, it will change your life!

Are you interested in seeing what a 60 or 90 minute Bars session can do for you?

I am a single dad with two kids would love to find a fun woman who also has kids to meet up with once in a while to let the kids play....and maybe we can get to know each other. I have a very busy job and life so finding time to date is almost impossible. But on the weekends I love to get the kids out to do fun things. I thought it might be nice to find someone in a similar situation to rendezvous with once in a while......maybe meet at the park...let the kids run around and be crazy.....and we get to talk and see if there is a connection. I'm not looking to jump into anything more than a friendship.....just want to put that out there upfront. About me....attractive, great shape, educated with a wonderful career. If you are interested, email me!

I just want to be honest from the beginning ,I'm looking for friends to help me explore Colorado. I moved here two months ago from California , I do have a wife in California. She's not sure she wants to move out here. I don't have any kids. I'm not looking for any drama, stress, or issues. Just want to go out to restaurants movies outdoors I want to get to know the good local spots to just enjoy and relax . Also would like to find some workout buddies. I go to the lakeshores gym. I do work a lot but my evenings are free. I haven't done this before so I'm kind of skeptical. Respond with comments a pic, just be real. I just don't have time for games or dishonesty. I'm not looking to meet right away.

Recently moved to a different part of town than I was in, and I have no friends out here at all. Looking to change that. I don't really care what your age is, or what your sex is, or your race, but I should let you know a little bit about myself so you know what type of person I am

I'm a musician, gamer, and stoner, and those go in interchangeable order. I also smoke cigarettes and cigars, so if that is not cool with you, tough luck. I've been playing guitar for 5 years and would love someone to jam with, or at least appreciate music with. I'm also mostly a pc gamer, but love playing Project M and am down to play other games (I don't have many myself, but if you do that's cool) Movies are great, walks in the park, just goofing off in general. I might seem opinionated or pretty radical, so if you are a conservative/ultra Christian we might not hit it off, unless we can keep that stuff under the table. I'm also pretty sarcastic and deadpan, so be prepared for me to say off color things that I don't mean at all. 

I guess I'd just like someone to hang out with, and if you're the right girl, maybe it can go further. Who knows. 

As a last note, it would be better to hang out with people closer to my age, as it would be easier to identify and relate to, but I'm not prejudiced. 

Also if it matters to you, I'm a white male, brunet hair, grey eyes.

I made a friend through Craigslist, and it was nerve wracking, perhaps embarrassing to think I'd needed to use the internet to find anyone to talk to. I've got a good personality, am fun, not a nut or a druggie and I even have all my teeth. But there I was, and he and I had made a connection, became friends and had big hopes for the future. 

But in time, he fell ill and passed away and I miss him terribly. I miss the random texts and his sense of humor. A lot has happened since then, and I find myself in a new town where everyone seems so very busy.

I'm not really expecting any replies and I don't expect to find what I had before (that wouldn't be fair to future friends), but I would like to move on. I'd love to have someone to text. 

That being said if you like heavy metal, odd things that are a little dark or macabre, art, film, the unusual, I'm for you. I'm open-minded, strange, and an artist. I love long conversations, but also cozy shared silence, falling asleep to a horror movie, going for walks in the rain in the summer, laying in the grass in a park in the middle of the night, laughs over pizza and playstation, people watching while sharing tea. I need a muse and a gentleman, but perhaps also an oddball, not someone who NEEDS me, but WANTS me. There's a difference. 

Anyway, friends or lovers, it doesn't matter. I'm happy with platonic, and believe that's where it should begin. **I'm not judgemental (I can handle most circumstance, I understand that shit happens), but please don't contact me if you're married. Be divorced, or working on a divorce for crap's sake. I'm no one's side woman. Pics will happen if we connect, and no, I don't want to see your dick.

Hey guys!

I for some reason admire and value a well shaped mans body either fit/thin to muscles. I honestly have no sexual desires toward men, but love to make people happy and I get aomehing out of giving someone a massage. I'd be down for one in return but it's not required. Looking for someone under 34 over 21. No charge, yeah dudes, this is NSA and free. And I'm freaking normal. All I ask is that you are cleaned up and are willing to share a few pictures. Available periodically throughout the weekend so just hit me up and be patient for a response.

It takes all kinds of people to make the world go 'round. 
And we are a couple that chose to embrace those that 
are a little different, who's ideas of a good time venture 
outside the normal parameters set by society, and we are
seeking out those that are like us in this aspect.

Male, female, couples, it doesn't matter! Good people
are good people no matter what, and that's what we are 
looking for. Good, honest, down to earth people who 
still have morals and place value on being decent.

Dinner, movie night, drinks, game night,hot tub-ing, 
parties, day trips to try something new, or just sitting 
around smoking a bowl and hanging out. It doesn't 
have to be crazy, and it doesn't have to be super mellow.
As long as we have good people around us that's what 
matters, that's what makes or breaks the experiences.....

Weather you like the green to slow down and mellow out,
the clear to get spun and go fast, or the white to just 
go a little crazy for the night, we don't care, and we don't judge.
We believe that everything is good in moderation, everything 
can be used to enhance your experience and your life. 

Send us a message, tell us a little about yourself,
your interests and your dislikes, tell us about the things
that make you, well you. We will respond to you, and if it seems
that this could be a friendship that enhances all our lives, we 
can progress like we should. 

We are NOT looking for hook ups ( though we can always hook you
up with your favorite party favors) We are NOT looking for pnp 
(although we are not opposed to it either. We are of a ""what happens
is what happens"" mindset.) We truly are just looking to add some
more good people to our lives, and we can't wait to meet you!!!!

Hi, I don't know your situation or your reason for checking out these ads. Maybe you are bored and just get a kick out of how corny, rude, silly, nasty most of them are. Maybe you just need to leave reality behind for a bit. Well hopefully here's one you might consider answering. Like you I'm not here looking for love or drugs or used undies or naked pictures. I'm here hoping there's someone out there who's not looking to change their situation but is missing the excitement of someone new. A reason to look at your phone. Maybe you've been married a long time and the thrill is gone, maybe your husband hangs out with his friends more than you like. What ever the reason (I can give you mine) if you'd like to e mail a bit with someone new. Some one you would have never met (or maybe you will, who knows) then give it a try. If we don't click nothing lost. Hope to hear from you.

So hello, age 43 female here. I've been Salsa dancing for 10 years. Everything from performing, competing and teaching. Unfortunately, the last couple of years, a back injury has kept me off the dance floor. Needless to say, I am having withdrawal symptoms. Currently I have, available to me, an awesome dance studio located in Brighton. If you have the time and dedication to come to Brighton I am looking for a ""Practice Partner"". My last practice partner was awesome and always gave me a challenge and his energy!! But he has since moved away from the area. Although I love beginners, I am looking for someone who I would NOT need to teach, but instead someone who already knows their basics and turns. Someone who we can BOTH challenge each other with new moves and an awesome healthy connection. You may already know me from the dance scene or it's possible we may have danced at one time or another. No no romantic or dating intentions, strictly dancing. Dance is my pill, my addiction and my stress reliever at the end of a long and difficult day at the office.

Let's do this!!

I don't really know the best words to use to give the best depiction of me so I'll just throw out some that others have used to describe me. Loving and Caring are maybe a top two. I love people and I love good hearted people. Nice Guy is another. I am always happy and smiling and in good spirits for the most part. I always consider others because I care for people. Now, I just feel like I will be alone again since I am moving to a new city. I am single and I only wish I could find my match partner to build a life with. I want to be able to come home and lay next to and cuddle what could be a platonic friend or there could be more but most importantly I hope I can meet someone in Denver that will make me feel at home and I can hang with when I am free. I love Camping, I want to learn how to shot a gun and a Bow and arrow, I speak a second language, Mandarin. I have lived in China for 6 years. I love group conversation and talking with intellectuals. I want to start this Journey in Denver ready to explore new people and explore a new city. I have some great friends here in Atlanta but I guess I have never had a best friend. I grew up spending a lot of time alone and I guess I want company more now. I've been told I need to put myself out there so this is me trying. 

Best,

I'm in my early 30's, and fully admit to loving my dogs way too much! I have lived here for 2.5 years now, and while I have some great lady friends, none of them have dogs. I spend a lot of time hiking in the mountains, going to dog parks, exploring new open spaces, etc. with my pups, and I'd love to get a group of similarly-minded outdoorsy animal lovers together and regularly go to new places with our dogs. I will happily share more about them and myself if I hear from you, but they are both in the 2-5 yr age range and are very active breeds that love either on or off-leash walks/hikes of anywhere from 3-13 miles.

If you are looking for some new girlfriends to hit the trails and parks with, please send me an email with a little bit about yourself and your pup/s. I'd love to get a small group of us together regularly if enough people are interested, so the more the merrier =) Or if just one awesome lady replies, that's fine too.

Whether you live in Denver, Boulder, or somewhere between, if you are looking for a close group of girl friends that share your enthusiasm for dogs and the outdoors, please send me an email =)

Do you have a desire to feel more at ease with life, no matter what is going on?

Having your Bars run can do just that. There are 32 points on your head that correspond to things like; healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named.

They store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything.

For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called ""money.""

Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it, clearing the space for new awareness to come in.

The creative possibilities for your life begin to open up!

It's been said that at worst a Bars session will feel like a great massage. At best, it will change your life!

Why do I want to meet you?

I want to meet because making that new connection is so intense and exciting and yes even awkward but still delicious. 

I want to meet because when our gazes meet I feel a ferocious rush of possibility. For me to try and deny my attraction and seem unaffected is pointless. My cells all scream. I am reeling. And I want to show you how I feel.

I want to meet because another soul has never had your particular eyes, your shade of skin, tone of voice, your unique scent. No one has ever had your energy and no one ever will and I want to drink it up. 

I want to meet because life is short and I don't want to leave this place someday regretting that I did not reach out to you. I don't want to wonder 'What if I had just been honest about how I feel? Would we have done our dance? Left our mark? Would we have added our play and our joy to the mix?'

I want to meet because there are hidden parts to me. One so tender that wants to show tenderness. One so primal and untamed it wants to make that known to you as well. One so sensual that wants to a awaken your senses. One that thirsts and wants to be intoxicated by your scents and your sounds and your tastes.

I want to meet because I'll admit it: a part of me craves the power to have you in the palm of my hand...quivering, shivering, aching, sweating, longing for bliss, spasming and begging for release. And I would like to grant it.

I want to meet because I'm tired of seeing you without speaking out, without reaching out, without touching, without embracing, without feeling your warmth for a time.

I want to meet even though yes I already have a life and do not want to walk away and destroy it. Still though, life is complicated and this fire inside of me to feel passion and romance won't burn out. The curiosity inside for the unfamiliar and the exotic won't be denied.

I'm about to be evicted, any day now my utilities will be shut off. 
I spent the last of what I had (except for $0.28) to fix my car. It worked.
Then I tried to go to work, which used up the last of the fuel in it. Normally I would have gotten paid tonight, right after working, but it's being postponed. The end result is that I won't be able to refuel until I get paid, which means I will miss a few days of work. This sets me back horribly because I need to make up last month's rent, next month's, utilities, and feed myself.
I know the Craigslist community as a whole seems to hate begging, and seems to eagerly take down any post even hinting at it, but I need help. I figure this help could come in one of two ways; The first would be transportation to work, which would be enough. The second would be the means for me to get myself to work. 
I would be working downtown, and it's not a long trip. The problem is, that I'd have to be there at 5:30 am. I know I'm not the only person who has to get up that early, so if you would be heading downtown anyway I'd love to hitch a ride. 
In the same way, some fuel or funds for fuel would also be immensely helpful.
So, finally, I am begging the CL community (see what I did there?) to take it easy on the flagging, and in return I will pull this abomination of a post down once I've figured something out. Also, nothing contained in this post is prohibited or against the terms of use. You'd have to be a dick, and likely a stupid one also, to flag. 
I need to keep working. If anyone has any lucrative ideas or jobs, I'd be open to it also.

I moved to the Denver area a few months ago and have spent much of that time alone, which isn't good for me, but I find it tiring to introduce myself to people over and over again only to find that they bore me. But don't despair--if you're reading this, you're probably not boring, even if you think you are. Anywho, that brings me here, again, in search of a friend. 

I am looking for a friendship of some sort, whether it's through texting or email or an occasional real-life meet for coffee or walk somewhere or anything, really. I can be difficult to get to know, and difficult to have as a friend, but may-haps I'm worth it. I'm not looking for a relationship outside of the bounds of a friend.

I would say I like deep conversations, but I'm not sure how deep. I like to walk without a destination in mind, often to look at houses. I like to sit on park benches and stare at trees while absorbing the sunlight. I recently took up painting. If I'm particularly bored, I like to knit scarves. I like to read, though I'm not as voracious as I once was. I like to cook and bake, and I sometimes like to vacuum, but only because I don't have much furniture. 

So if this interests you, I await your reply.

I'm a senior in college and have decided on my senior project. What I would like to do is photograph average, everyday women to try and prove everyone is beautiful on the outside.

Last semester I watched a video in class about how people use photoshop to create unrealistic pictures of women for advertising. I already knew everyone does this, but the outrage and hurt from the women in my class really stuck with me. This is for them, and for everyone else, who has ever felt ashamed of themselves.

What I'd like to do is find as many women as I can, all age ranges, all body types, all skin tones, and photograph them. With the right lense, lighting, angle, background, etc, I can prove anyone can be a model.

I would like to do fully clothed, partially clothed, and semi nude, that choice is totally up to you. I can also make sure your face is obscured. And of course, you will get a copy of every picture I take.

If you'd like a free photo shoot, to feel like a goddess, to help me complete my project and to give those fake models a big middle finger, I'd love to talk to you. Thank you.

I've lost motivation to change myself and eventually I'll probably just accept the failure that I am. 

I'm 225 lbs. I gained the weight back I worked so hard to lose. Despite having a gym membership and funds for healthy food, I lack the drive to make changes. 

I compare myself to others and come up inadequate. 

I have nothing to show for myself. 

I feel guilty for 98% of every action I do. Slept through my alarm? Yep, I'm a failure. Didn't stick to my diet? I should give up. I find myself lusting after someone? That's gross and shameful. 

If I could sleep all day, I would. I'm not living. 

How do I become the person I want to be? The size, shape, persona, of my dream self? I lack the determination of change, though I desire it so much. 

If I keep going this route, I'm going to hate myself even more.

Please help

Hi and thanks for reading. I am looking for a new friend to chat with primarily in the evenings about life, movies, friends or whatever is on your mind. My work, and life in general means I have little time to hang out with the few friends I have in town, and they aren't too keen chatting online. My hope is that we can develop a great friendship.

I live in the cross creek/traditions/adonea area, and it would be great if you also live here so at least we have something in common to talk about to get the ball rolling. I am married, but we have such different schedules we barely have time to talk. 

Hope to speak with you soon

In the header put your fav metal band or any genre of music but it'd be cool to find someone who has similar music tastes. I listen to bands like Bathory, Electric Wizard, Carach Angren, and Watain.

Craigslist is loaded with postings from lonely people, and there are many (especially guys) who are looking for a FWB situation. This generally means that they are looking for casual sex, no commitments. It is pretty shallow and superficial. Unfortunately, it also is a good indicator of how sad things have become: people in unsatisfying relationships, who have found that being with ONE PERSON does not meet all their needs.

I am also in one of those relationships. These things get complicated, and there are numerous reasons not to end it. In my case, children, a genuine caring and love (you can love someone but not BE IN LOVE), certain needs and dependencies your mate may have, and even practical things like financial. This is not a case of verbal or physical abuse, massive infidelity, or general incompatibility. Sometimes you fall out of love, and over many years lose all the spark... you function almost simply as room mates.

So, what are the benefits I am looking for?? In this case, having an emotional connection. Having an attraction where you feel appreciated, noticed, valued; being able to share intimate things, someone with whom a deep friendship can develop. Sometimes, there is a physical chemistry as well, and even the excitement of that feeling is worth a great deal, even if you agree not to pursue it. Not sure if I can go there, but maybe. 

Having these feelings, and the specialness of a close friend, with whom you can share most anything... maybe even finding a touch of that soul mate that you lack.

So this is what I seek. 

A bit about me: I turn 58 soon, retired, fit and decent looking; high energy, creative, witty, intelligent and well-educated, a voracious reader, good writer, musical, good cook and a foodie. I like to talk over strong coffee or a glass of wine. I like long walks on a warm, calm day (does the wind EVERY stop here?). I want us to be mutually interested in each other, our gifts, our life stories... and have similar needs: we both are in relationships but want more. Obviously, discretion is a must.

First of all, let me start out by trying to make a positive and refreshing statement for a post that you would find on craigslist. I am very respectful and capable of NOT being a ""creepy"" guy. You know the ""creepy"" type, the guy that makes you feel uncomfortable because of a comment or unwelcome physical contact. My name is Paul. I'm 28 years old. I'm looking for someone to chat with and get comfortable talking to. I'd like to find some friends to get to know and hang out with at some point. I just moved here from New Jersey. I have three roommates who are cool as hell to go out and have fun with and can hang with the best of them. They are the types of chick's anyone can get along with. Having said that, I am a very social person and am driving myself bananas. There are times where I am all alone and I wish I had more options on people to hang out with. So I've decided to post this message to find a friend. I have a kayak and bicycle. I love to fish but I always put them back cause killing then seems too cruel. Want someone to laugh with and hang with and learn about and just bond with. I hope to hear from someone. Once again this is not for sex, this is just me looking for friends to eventually meet and have a blast with. I don't care what race you are, what your sexual preferences are or how you choose to identify yourself either. Everyone is welcome. I didn't demonstrate it in this post, (because i thought it more important to bring the reader of this post to the conclusion that I'm actually trustworthy and deserving of a chance at friendship) but I'm very sarcastic and love to bust people's chops.

So this is way unconventional but my wife signed me up for bags and gifts thing. And I need to have a launch party. This stuff is mostly designed for women but there a handful of things us guys could find very useful. Also you can buy the girly things for your women or potential women. No one thinks I'm going to have a successful party. I wanna kill it and I thought what better place to do it then a strip club. There will be prizes, drink tickets and hot women. We are doing this to help our son who is autistic get a therapy dog. The dog costs 12k $ so this will prob just be a small part. So I figured why not come out do a good deed and get to see sexy women. Hit me back for more details.

Hello everyone. I'm just going to tell you a story. I was on a road trip and riding in the passenger seat of my brother's car when a semi truck ran right into the passenger side going about 40 mile per hour. I don't remember the accident at all. They had to cut me out of the car with the jaws of life. I just remember waking up and the doctors telling me that they can't treat me at the hospital and they can either transport me to Wichita or Denver. Since I'm from Colorado and my family lives in the Springs I of course chose Denver. 
My femur was broken in two places and I had fractured my pelvis in multiple locations and I had an ureatheral tear. (which is the scariest injury to me!) They put a metal rod in my leg that night. I have to relearn how to walk all over again, but I know that through hard work, determination and faith I will heal up in the next six to eight weeks.
And that is why I am posting this. My family can only visit once a week, if that, and I normally can handle being alone but I find myself getting kind of lonely in this hospital room. I'm looking for a smart woman who can hold a good conversation to come and visit me during the day. 
I am a 29 year old white male with a full beard. I like the outdoors, camping, riding my mountain bike. I love to travel! In fact, I'm going to start working on my dream of being able to travel and make a living at the same time. After this accident I'm going to start living my dream! 
So if you are interested in meeting a nice guy who stands up for his convictions in a non-threatening environment like a hospital room, than email me and maybe we can eat lunch together. You don't need to buy me lunch I'm not a bum, I'll order both of us some good ole hospital food from room service, lol. I'm a smart ass so if you don't like sarcasm you wouldn't like conversations with me. After a couple of emails I'll tell you what hospital I'm at and the room number. I would also like to talk to you first as well,
So yeah ladies, I would like to meet new people and see where it goes, I like making new friends and that's all I'm really looking for. Meeting a person unique enough for me to date would be very rare, but hey, you never know. Thanks

I am looking a woman (40-60) who is in a marriage like mine that has lost intimacy and romance. Mostly looking for others to talk and relate to, not necessarily for sex. Who knows... maybe we can help each other figure out what the hell to do about it... or maybe we can just vent to each other... or...

I am interesting, good looking, very successful (well, except for maybe in my marriage?!?). I like to eat, cook, drink wine, talk, walk, read, write, bike, play the guitar, sing, and grow my own herbs for pesto!

If this might be you, I am in Central Denver. This will be very casual, with no strings and no expectations, (except maybe for a good ear, and hopefully a desire to talk over good coffee, wine, or on a walk!)

Hello. So, I am just laying here, a little lost and lonely. I am married, going on 10 years now, and things are slowly going away. First the attention left, than the affection and intimacy left, now all communication has gone. I was getting used to the lack of intimacy and affection, but not being able to talk is getting really hard and lonely. I enjoy talking about everything and anything, so it is now taking at toll. Wondering if there is someone else out there in a similar situation. Looking for a friend and not to change anyone's situation. Looking forward toh hearing from you.

Hello. I am a married man looking for a friend, married or not, to be able to talk to about everything and anything. Although I am married, I am also lonely at times. It would be nice to find a someone in a similar situation. I miss the talking, the texting to just say hi, playful banter and fun. Not looking to change my situation or yours, just looking for a friend to make me feel warm and fuzzy. I also have kik if that is easier, buddhaman1369.

Hello; Was just looking with no expectations, really...But, hey...no gain, no pain. Right? lol

Looking to meet single or divorced male ONLY. Pls no married or attached, or separated. Not interested. Looking for someone who is young at heart, with no baggage, or hang ups. 

Ideally, I am attracted to Caucasian men, a bit younger, hard working, and proud, with intelligence and wits.

The very reason for this ad is to find a clean cut type guy with old fashioned values and standards. May be north west has it? Here on the east coast, or N.E. we have none. Nobody to date. I gave up.

I am in central MA, two hours from Boston. I am divorced, professional, young at heart and looks female. I am in my fifties, but not shabby at all...much younger guys ask me out, if you can believe it.
I have pictures to prove it...lol

But, later, please! No pressure. And, I wont pressure you. I can assure you, I am real, I am sane, a I am clean cut, down to earth, low maintenance woman. But, I am also independent, and free spirited.

Can be feisty and direct. I don't shy a way from confrontations or a debate. Not needy at all.

Ideally, I want to find that special guy for friendship and communication first. If we click, and connect, and all goes well...I don't mind to visit. Distance should not be an issue. Agree?

I enjoy nature, hiking, gardening, walks, culture, music, travel, reading, and much more...

So, there...didn't want to make it long...but, don't want to waste my time or yours either.

I guess, I am looking for someone who is on the same wave length.

Anyhow...that's it from me. Be looking forward to hearing from you!

One thing I hate when I receive one line emails with no substance at all. 

I delete. End of story.

Otherwise, be happy to hear from you!

Thanks.

I don't know what to say, or even why I am here, or what I am looking for. I met the girl of my dreams 14 years ago. I married her after meeting only a few times, I was young and dumb and in love... adopted her 8 month old baby and took him on as my own with no hesitancy. I spent 14 years making sure she knew she was the love of my life. I opened doors, courted her, made her breakfast every morning, found different ways to show my love, flowers randomly every month, etc. etc. etc. We had our ups and downs, and both had our bad habbits but I thought we were happy overall. She said she was. Until one day she left her computer open and I caught a message.... she was about to meet up to screw some other guy she barely knew.....yeah so my world was flipped upside down. I spent years making her feel loved (always felt un appreciated by her) and here some guy was able to almost just walk right in ( she claims nothing happened) i'll never know. so I don't know where I am now. I have 3 kids, I can't turn their life upside down. No one knows that she did this, they all think shes so perfect (I am not about to destroy her reputation with anyone including our kids) but I just don't see the point of trying, and going out of my way to make her feel special. this guy was engaged (nice guys always finish last apparently) so I guess im looking for someone to talk to who can relate or likes to be treated like the center of someone's world once in a while. if you are still reading hit me up. I am 35, have a great career I love camping, shooting, hiking, working out and just about everything.

I can only speak for myself, but I assume I am not alone. 

Women complain that there are no decent guys; that all men want are FWBs or one-nighters, or when a request for a pic is sent, a shot of a man's weiner comes back.

I am an older guy, 50, but still look youngish. All my dark hair, all my teeth, 5'11"", a hint of my young Army officer body remains. 

I met a woman online last week, she said she was European and wanted a nice relationship. I emailed. She thanked me for my mature response. We chatted that first night and she asked if we could meet right away. I couldn't, but figured she was spontaneous.

I made a date for the next Sunday night but had a major project come up and had to postpone. She lives downtown, I said I had an appt downtown Tuesday and maybe we could meet then.

Tuesday noon, I text her and offer to meet her for a light lunch and maybe a glass of wine. On me. Her response:

""What an inconsiderate asshole you are! I just woke up.""

Just woke up? What are you, a dopesmoking teen?

I was taken aback, tried to calm her down, then out of left field, she texts; ""All you Colorado men just want sex, you want to try to fuck me!""

I had a NO TIME made any reference to sex, hooking up, or anything but decent chatting. 

I was very disappointed as I was looking to meet someone for movies, cooking, driving into the mountains, general fun and companionship. One need not discuss sex, if you like each other the sex will happen naturally. 

When I spontaneously meet women, they like me. But I can never wrangle those meets into a date. 

Honestly, I'm beginning to think all women are nuts.

My boyfriend and I just moved here from Florida. I love it here so far, but I know about two people outside of work. All we need now are some like minded individuals to geek out together. 

STOP NOW if you are looking for anything other than friendship. I do not want naughty photos. Not looking for a hookup or anything of the kind. If you are planning on emailing me asking for 'noods' please just forget this post or I exist. Ok now that that is covered back to the actual post lol

We have pets so would prefer if you weren't allergic as we are always covered in pet hair of all kinds.

We are BIG time gamers. I collect consoles, but my boyfriend is a PC gamer. Also love us some boardgames! Would be great to meet someone who loves boardgames, so we could set up game nights. We do not play your typical boardgames though. No monopoly! Warning: he is a sore winner/loser. Don't play with us if you can't handle A LOT of shit talking and competition.

I am a crafter. Mainly I cross stitch for my Etsy shop. I am learning to knit and crochet. I sew, but it is mostly liners for my chinchilla cage lol. I want to try more hobbies, and have a shopping buddy for the craft shop. Be prepared to spend hours in there if we go. 

I bake! Food is a passion. I love to bake and cook. I eat meat, but I don't care if you don't. 

As for reading, films, and such. I love scifi! I read mainly science fiction. I watch The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Girls, Once Upon a Time, Bojack Horseman, The 100, Orange is the New Black, etc. I love Battlestar Galactica and Firefly. I will watch almost any movie or show except I HATE ALL THINGS TWILIGHT AND FIFTY SHADES. Favourite movies: Star Wars, Stardust, Hitchhiker's Guide. I love anime! And I am Studio Ghibli obsessed! 

Please never use the words: Bae, Turnt, Thot, or Fleek. They are not real words. I don't mind if your spelling sucks or even grammar. Use all the short hand typing your want or we can have a conversation in emojis lol just not those words.

I work part time so I have A LOT of free time.

I curse like a sailor. If swearing bothers you I can try to watch my language, but you have been warned. My favourite word is the 'F word' which I say countless times throughout the day. 

I have a few disorders I try not to let get in the way of my day. If you were understanding when I have 'bad days' or 'episodes' that would be super! I have anxiety, depression, OCD, and mild agoraphobia.

My boyfriend and I are crazy immature. So, we would prefer friends in the 21-30 age bracket. Unless you are also immature then 'age ain't nothing but a number.' We do not have kids. I do not mind kids they just aren't for me. I lack the maternal instinct (no it will not come with time and I will not change my mind so please don't say this to me). I am crazy awkward around children. So, if you have kids I don't mind just don't be offended when I get weird around them because I really have no idea how to act. 

I do not care what your sexual orientation, skin colour, religion, or political stand is (unless you're a trump supporter. If you are again forget I exist). But if that stuff matters to you here are my stances on them: I am bi, white, agnostic (raised baptist), independent (Sanders supporter), pro-choice, etc.

-- Educated (bachelor's degree or above)
-- Too much of a grammar/literacy nerd to engage in a lot of abbreviating
-- Somewhat brainy (interested in books, current events, art, etc.)
-- At least minimally interested in sports (playing and watching)
-- Flirty, but in a mature, compelling way
-- Level-headed and non-stalkery
-- Interested in periodic emailing throughout the day

Bonus points for the following:

-- Love NPR
-- Enjoy coffee/tea

Hi, 

I am couple months out of a long relationship, and find myself with no female friends. I am missing that part of my life. I am not looking for a hook up or a fwb situation, just a laid back down to earth woman who wants to go out and enjoy the state we live in. 

I am an awesome person with a kick ass personality, down to earth, understanding, philosophical, enjoy good banter, going out, eating at random spots around town, or hitting up a random bar or show. I am always up for something fun. Most importantly I am not a douche. And if you must know I am definitely easy on the eyes. I can keep up in a conversation, and have tons of useless information in my head haha.

You and I are here for the same reason. Like me, you are married, but the thrill is gone and passion is dead. Like me, you are lonely and want to meet someone new. You're probably nervous -I know that I am. You tell yourself that you're only looking for a friend. But deep inside, you know that you are really looking for a lover. Maybe you're not looking for a physical affair, but you're definitely looking for more than just friendship. I am too.

Let's chat and see what happens. Have a beautiful day!

Maybe you've thought about moving to the PNW, or maybe you're just bored and want a new friend to exchange emails with. Whatever the case may be, I'm available for email or chat.

Due to my working a night shift, I pretty much have to resort to trying to meet people online. I have tried to post locally and haven't had very much luck. My theory is that due to living in such an ""IT guy"" concentrated region, there is huge competition when it comes to meeting women online. Or maybe I'm just not doing it right? Who knows. I've tried OkCupid and that seems even worse.

A little about me...

Being that I live in Seattle, you may have me somewhat figured out. I smoke weed, I drink coffee, I work in technology, and I'm progressive. I have LGBT friends and family. So, we may not mesh well if you're religious or conservative, though I'm open for debating stuff if that's your thing.

I work in IT for a popular retail company. As I mentioned, I work a night shift which leaves me fairly isolated, however I only work 3-4 nights a week, so that's nice because it allows me time to work on music and do other productive things like play video games and watch movies. I like working nights, being awake at night. It's peaceful and sort of like a whole different world. I do stay up until around noon, so it's not like I don't get to see daylight ever, but this schedule does not seem conducive to making new friends.

I play and record guitar, bass, synths, drums, and vocals. I don't have a band right now, but I'm hoping to put one together soon, and I'm hoping that playing my music live will help with meeting people. My music is sort of indie rock with some electronica. My musical tastes range from jazz like Ella Fitzgerald and Miles Davis, to bands like Tool and Radiohead. I was raised on The Beatles, Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Abba, classic rock. One of my favorite 'contemporary' bands is Pinback.

I like getting out and about when I can. There are so many great, beautiful places around Seattle to explore, hike, go camping, etc. I also enjoy traveling when I get the chance. I have been to Canada and Scotland and I'd like to visit many more places, take your pick.

I'm getting back into shape and I feel pretty good about it. I have a home gym where I work out about every other day. I'm also eating healthier; lots of vegetables and fewer carbs/sugar. I'm growing my own garden this year, too, so I'm excited about that.

So, yeah, that's a little about me, now how about you? Feel free to ask me anything, too. I look forward to hearing from you (ʘ‿ʘ)

I do not mind to hike solo but the place I go to is does get a bit steep towards the top, so I figure I should try to find someone who shares my interest of hiking and is not afraid of heights. I dont mind going to other trails too, but there is one spot I love going to that some would say is only for hard core hikers. I actually bought trekking poles and other stuff specifically because of that trail. I am in my late 30s, adventurous, divorced, content, fun, easy going and have no expectations for anything.

One of the things I miss about a significant other is going to brunch on Sunday morning. The few girlfriends I have either go to church or have boyfriends and don't get out much anymore.

I love Snooze, but don't like to wait an hour for breakfast. Maybe you have a smaller, less crowded favorite breakfast place. I enjoy good coffee, conversation and meeting new people. There has to be someone else out there looking for something similar.

I'm 40 something, don't do drama, won't stand you up and can talk about a wide range of topics as long as it isn't sports. Although I do have an opinion on Peyton Manning given the recent news that's come out. Now I've probably lost most of Denver, but that's okay. I'm interested in quality, not quantity. Please be willing to meet somewhere in Denver, I live in the city and am not much for the suburbs.

So my work is taking a few of us out and everyone is bringing their wives and girlfriends. My ex fiancé decided she needed to ""find herself"" a few weeks ago so here I am trying to find someone fun to take to this work party. Nothing crazy but we're going bowling. Free food and as many drinks as you want. I don't want to be the only guy there alone. So if your fun and open to hanging out and getting drunk with a bunch of people you've never met so I can avoid explaining why I'm there alone, that'd be sweet. Really just looking for someone who wants to have a good time. Don't get sloppy drunk though, that shit ain't cute and my boss is gonna be there. Haha if you can handle that. Shoot me an email. Pictures are cool too.

This hurts me. Does it hurt you too?

I sent you to Tacoma, WA for help with your cancer. You wanted to go there and only there so I bought you the bus ticket and three days worth of food for the road. I would have gone with you but legal restrictions at the time prevented me from leaving. Plus, your a marine, you love your independence. Even if I was free you would have asked me to stay and I would have been compliant. So, I gave you my number, the bus ticket and the food, we said goodbye, and we went our separate ways.

I have placed ads seeking romance and love, and yes, I received tons of responses but not one sincere encounter. Lolol. It's sad and comical at the same time. So here is my desire. Want to hang out, play cards, go to the movies, cook with each other, see a play, go out for cocktails, play Farmvile together, tell jokes to eachother, talk until late in the night, cry on eachothers' shoulder if necessary? I am a lovely woman with a magnificently huge and loving heart. Been up the Street and back more then a few times so during my travels I have learned that friendship is necessary before the romance begins. Why not??? 100% Italian, successful, well-read,kind, great humorous soul, love of music and the fine arts. Don't ask me if I want to get laid, and please don't flash your penis at me... Lolol... You will not be disappointed. Ciao baby.

Mature couple looking for friendship and fun and also same room sex, maybe touching each other if all agree. ..PS female is straight. we live in the SE area of aurora around iliff & tower. Its been a while since we've met anyone that we can really call a real friend and now we are finally beginning to look. we are fairly active and fit especially in the summer but winter time is hard. A few of our interests are going out to dinner, watching movies and games can usually be a lot of fun. We like fires and hot tubs, and shooting pool. Brad loves to ski and jane would like to learn. this sounds terrible so far but in the warmer months...Apr.-Oct. we belong to a pvt lake 60 mi E of aurora where we spend a good share of our time up there. we have a 21 ft boat and a 5th wheel and are really looking for our friends to come up and join us. so I guess we're looking for people that enjoy boating as we spend our time wakeboarding,waterskiing, wakesurfing, tubing you name it! In the evening a fire or just watch movies and it's nice taking the boat out at night as well. we are looking for fun outgoing respectful couples that just want to have fun and hopefully end up with a true friendship. we are not drinkers..we do smoke but plan on quiting soon and brad will smoke weed once in a while for medical reasons. we are young at heart,mind, body and retired, with a lot of free time. so if this stupid add interests you please give us a shout out. you have nothing to lose and maybe we will end up with a good friendship. Any age is fine..it's only a number and please send us a pic or two so we can see who were talking with. Maybe we can talk and meet in time to watch the super bowl together?Have a great day..peace out..PS as far as the hot tub suits are optional,how ever if you were uncomfortable without one we would wear one not to be offensive.

Hi there, 


I am a 37 year old white male. I have a couple groupon movie tix, popcorn and drinks for the Elvis Theater off Hampden. I live in SE Aurora. I just have to use these tix before they expire. As far as tomorrow, since it's so nice outside, maybe we could either go to Manitou Springs and do The Incline or hike in Golden or somewhere. I am merely just looking for company for one or both. No expectations, just plenty of laughter and a good workout!!! I have a pretty hectic work schedule and spaced out that I bought the tix on groupon, lol.

I am looking for a friend to add to my life. Working all the time, doesn't really allow me to get out and make friends. I am engaged to a great man and have been in a relationship for almost 6 years. We have a 4 yr old son as well. I do not smoke or do drugs. I do drink on occasion. We moved here from FL almost 2 years ago and love it here. I do have a membership to a 24HR Fitness gym and would love a partner to go with. I go to the one at Arapahoe and S Parker Rd. I would like someone that we can grow and be friends and IF it all falls into place, we can be more than friends. I am a very girly girl and would like the same. I am a 39 year old caucasian. I am not judgmental and expect the same. I am in an interracial relationship and see all people the same and expect the same. I am about 185 pounds and need to lose quite a bit of weight and looking for that friend that we could motivate each other. I am very romantic and gentle, soft and nurturing. I am not looking for a man, any ""butch"" or anything like that, as I am happily in a relationship with a man. And yes, he may start off by just watching us play, but will join in at some point. Hopefully making this a perfect poly relationship at some point. So with that being said, you MUST be bisexual. I would love someone to go out and have coffee, take a walk, sit and chat and watch football and more. If you have kids that is great. If not, that is fine too, but you MUST accept that I do and he is my world. If you have any interest, please send pic with intro about yourself. 

Not looking to just photo swap and/or endless emailing. Will want to voice verify or even video verify soon after chatting.

I am looking for a best friend. A guy or a girl, doesn't matter to me. The only thing that matters is that you have a good heart, be non judgmental, be tolerant of others (have no hate for color or orientation), have a love of animals. I don't eat anything from animals and try to keep a cruelty free, green home. Someone with a similar frame of mind would be great. I am kind of an introvert and ISTP/INTJ on the MB personality type, which makes it a little hard to be outgoing to find friends. I am better texting but I'm not into all the abbreviations. I know lol and brb but that's about all I care to know or use. I just want to have a friend that has my back, and will know what to say to make me laugh or calm me down. I don't have kids and don't want any. If you have kids that's cool, its just not my thing. Please feel free to ask questions to get to know me.

I've done one these before with no success, but I'm all about second chances and I'm gonna give this another try because why not. I've got nothing to lose, but only hope to gain a friendship.

So I'm just gonna put this out there and say that I'm seeking a legitimate friendship. I don't want a hook up or a relationship. While we don't have to meet, I'm okay with a pen pal type of thing. 

I'm super nice, I get along with almost anyone. I'm kind, sweet, and totally down to earth. I love almost all types of music, love movies. My idea of fun involves going out or staying in being lazy. I like deep conversations, long walks, cooking, exploring new interests. I'd like to take up something artsy like pottery or painting. I'm not artistically inclined at all, but I'm intrigued. Pop culture and current events are topics that I'm interested. I'm a walking contradiction at times, but I make up for it with my awesomeness, haha. I can be funny and corny jokes is one of my favorite things.

Hi. My name is Kalia, I'm 23, and I have agoraphobia.

What that means, practically, is that I have a hard time leaving my home. It makes it pretty difficult to meet people, as you can probably guess.

Commonly asked questions: No, I don't work. Yes, I get my groceries delivered. No, staying at home is not ""relaxing and fun"". Yes, it's very lonely. No, I didn't make a decision to live this way, I have a condition that requires it. Yes, I'm working very hard towards my recovery.

I'm looking for a friend. Someone who will like me and spend time with me in spite of my limitations. I have trouble leaving my home, but otherwise I'm a normal person. I like action movies and comedy specials. I'm a huge nerd. I love comic books and superheroes, as well as magic and fantasy. I play a lot of video games, especially RPGs like Skyrim and Fallout. I read fanfiction. I'm into Game of Thrones and Harry Potter, Arrow and The Flash. My favorite cartoon is Steven Universe.

I want to meet someone who will bring over blankets and pillows for a movie marathon, or help me try a new recipe for the first time, or go for long walks around the neighborhood.

I have a lot of free time on my hands, and I'd like to spend some of it with a new friend.

Hi,

I am seeking someone fun who likes to be outdoors and participate in outdoor activities. This is platonic. Can include lunch or breakfast before or after or beers. I am just a busy guy who is wanting someone fun to do outdoor activities with and make friends with.

You should like to do one or all of the following activities. I am in very good physical shape and like to push myself and keep active and fit.

-Road cycling (more paved trails than roads)
-Mtn biking (light to moderate intensity)
-Running and jogging on paved trails, open space trails and at Wash Park
-Indoor spinning and fitness
-Racquetball
-Hiking
-Skiing
-Working out a Red Rocks

I'd prefer someone in their late 20's or 30's, or early 40's just so we might have something in common. I like people who are on time when we agree to go do something and have a good attitude about the activity.

Please send some basic info if you reply and what you like to do outside for fun.

Thanks

I don't usually find myself in town on Friday nights very often. I guess this is a rare exception. With that being said, I've been wanting to try out Bellwether on Colfax near my house. I've been there during the day, but I've never tried their whiskey/coffee in the evenings. Its definitely a hipster type place although I am certainly not a hipster myself. I still like the set up and wouldn't mind exchanging stories over a whiskey/coffee with a like minded woman tonight.

34, smart, funny, successful, fit, compassionate and courteous. Curious as well as educated about, and, on any number of subjects.

I am looking for a best friend. A guy or a girl, doesn't matter to me. The only thing that matters is that you have a good heart, be non judgmental, be tolerant of others (have no hate for color or orientation), have a love of animals. I don't eat anything from animals and try to keep a cruelty free, green home. Someone with a similar frame of mind would be great. I am kind of an introvert and ISTP/INTJ on the MB personality type, which makes it a little hard to be outgoing to find friends. I am better texting but I'm not into all the abbreviations. I know lol and brb but that's about all I care to know or use. I just want to have a friend that has my back, and will know what to say to make me laugh or calm me down. I don't have kids and don't want any. If you have kids that's cool, its just not my thing. Please feel free to ask questions to get to know me.

Hey everyone! 

I am an attached female, living with my partner and our two pups. He is very into gaming, board games and video games, and I am very into art of all forms. We share a love for Doctor Who, Adventure Time, A Perfect Circle and music like it, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and weird hats. We are both individually very quirky (Gemini and Aquarian). He is completely sober and always has been, so while I don't drink or smoke around him, I do drink and smoke (420) on occasion. It is important for him to not have those substances used around him. I am 22, and he is 30. 

When I bought my 3 day passes for Comic Con in June, I realized that we are at a point where we don't have any friends close enough to go to con with, or to share a hotel room or anything like that, as we did last year. So, I'm reaching out, looking for some great people to get to know, who might be interested in going to DCC with us and getting to know us. We both really crave having good friends in our lives.

Next, I want to mention that I am straight and in a relationship at this time - Though I could care less if you're gay, straight, bi, or what not. Now let's get to the general parts of this posting! 

About Me: 25, male, white, blond, blue eyes, et cetera. I drink on occasion, do edibles (cannabis) occasionally as well but nothing harder - Please don't do anything harder and don't be a heavy smoker (cigarettes, can't stand the smell personally). 

My Hobbies: I'm a Systems Engineer/Administrator, so technology on the whole is my passion and career. I also do enjoy gaming, mainly FPS, racing or sports games. Sports wise, I'll watch just about anything but I am particularly into NBA. I'm also trying to get a little more active, such as making more trips up to the mountains to go hiking and going out to play basketball/sports. Plus getting out to dog parks (when the puppy is old enough and in better health) and other dog friendly events/items.

What I'm searching for and why: I don't believe in having a lot of 'friends' who I barely know and barely know me. I'd rather have a 'best friend' or a couple of really close friends. Due to moving a lot growing up and just moving out here soon, I don't really have any out here. I've stopped being in denial, as my 'best friend' was always making me pick up the tab and would flake out on hanging out at last minute (without even letting me know, just silence). I'm not saying I want to not pick up tabs or anything like it, I just don't want to get stuck in a friendship that's 1 sided and not a true friendship.

Well, hopefully after I laid all this out there - There's some of you who read this that will reply and we'll hit it off. If not, then I hope you find whatever it is you're on here looking for.

Next, I want to mention that I am straight and in a relationship at this time - Though I could care less if you're gay, straight, bi, or what not. Now let's get to the general parts of this posting! 

About Me: 25, male, white, blond, blue eyes, et cetera. I drink on occasion, do edibles (cannabis) occasionally as well but nothing harder - Please don't do anything harder and don't be a heavy smoker (cigarettes, can't stand the smell personally). 

My Hobbies: I'm a Systems Engineer/Administrator, so technology on the whole is my passion and career. I also do enjoy gaming, mainly FPS, racing or sports games. Sports wise, I'll watch just about anything but I am particularly into NBA. I'm also trying to get a little more active, such as making more trips up to the mountains to go hiking and going out to play basketball/sports. Plus getting out to dog parks (when the puppy is old enough and in better health) and other dog friendly events/items.

What I'm searching for and why: I don't believe in having a lot of 'friends' who I barely know and barely know me. I'd rather have a 'best friend' or a couple of really close friends. Due to moving a lot growing up and just moving out here soon, I don't really have any out here. I've stopped being in denial, as my 'best friend' was always making me pick up the tab and would flake out on hanging out at last minute (without even letting me know, just silence). I'm not saying I want to not pick up tabs or anything like it, I just don't want to get stuck in a friendship that's 1 sided and not a true friendship.

Well, hopefully after I laid all this out there - There's some of you who read this that will reply and we'll hit it off. If not, then I hope you find whatever it is you're on here looking for.

Iam looking to move to Denver, And wanted to get some information from you on where to live, I'm a 29 white gay male, I will not have a car and will be using public transportation to get around. I will be moving from new Orleans, La as soon as I can get a job transfer. So I guess I would need to move around May of 2016. I want to stay under 900.00amonth bills payed. I would be working in downtown at a hotel.
I do not know anyone there yet, So I guess I would like my own place like a studio space or even a good roommate, I do want to make friends.

Ok never tried this before so here it goes.

I'm Mike, a fun laid back chill guy to be around. Just recently moved back to Denver and looking to meet make new friends. I get along with everyone so really doesn't matter who you are I'm sure will click.

My hobbies consist of going to the movies, out with friends, playing pool/ bowling. I love taking random strolls around town. Traveling and exploring. Trying new restaurants and places. I'm pretty much up for trying anything at least once (NOT DRUGS THOUGH!!!) and yes that includes 420.

Ok, now that's out of the way. You can often see me at car shows, walking around the mall, downtown or pretty much checking out some place I recently heard about. I'm always keeping an ear out for upcoming events. Summer is my favorite time of the year just love the outdoors, but I do enjoy the winter to point. Sorry not a huge fan of the cold...which is funny because I'm a born and raised native here in Colorado.

Here little bit more. . ..

Books: MAGS (Car, Computer, Comic, Geek, Music, etc..) History Books, LOTR, The Hobbit, Mystery Thrillers, pretty much anything really.

Movies: Comedy, Action, Disney/Pixar, Historical.

Music: Mostly Alternative Rock, EDM, Trance, and a little Rap/R&B. (I HATE HEAVY METAL!!!!)

Shows: F1 Racing, Top Gear (BBC), Game of Throwns, Person of Interest, Pawn Stars.

Movies: I LOVE MOVIES. I love cuddling up at home and watching a movies, love going to the theaters to.

Foods: Sea foods, Italian, Asian Cuisines, Indian, My own cooking!!!!. I love trying new restaurants.

P.S. Don't ask me who my favorite artist/bands, actors/actress are. I really don't make it a point to remember there names. Just the names of songs and movies.

What if? What if you had a really down to earth guy in your world who legitimately took time to hear you when he listened to you? One who didn't try to solve your problems, but who took time to cherish the way you work through them? He was honorable to your needs without being a burden. He got you stoned and played you a band you never heard before?

And what if, when this cool ass dude recognized how hot you were, let you watch him fantasize about how awesome you are while you watched?

Never any ""crossing-of-the-lines"". Totally platonic, just with a rebellious disdain for whatever the difference is between rubbing my shoulder or my throbbing cock in front of you. One is definitely more interesting to watch, you can't deny that!

Human beings need touch, we all need to be held, and no one should be denied from receiving such wonderful medicine.

I am a 30 year old male who lives in Arvada CO. I have brown hair, blue eyes, and a teddy bear build. I am offering my sweet loving touch to you. I offer one-on-one, non-sexual, cuddling, and touching. This includes spooning, holding, hair caressing, hand holding, and talking/therapy if you want that too. I am a great listener. I really do care and want to support YOU. I am easy to talk to, non-judgmental, open minded, and extremely nurturing. We don't have to talk either, could be strictly cuddling.

We all need this type of touch therapy. We can discuss what you're comfortable with (some people may just want me to play with their hair and listen to them). Together we will create safe boundaries before we touch. I also offer massage and cranial sacral work for an additional fee. Imagine getting a wonderful massage and then being held by the person who just massaged you.

I do this work because I love it, because I believe in it. I have seen the power that loving, nonsexual touch and connection has to heal and transform lives. Let me be a reflection to you, to shine back your own perfect light. I want to make this world a better place and that starts with YOU.

$40 for a 60 minute snuggle session with me. I can come to your space or you can come to mine depending on your preference.

If you are interested send me some information about yourself and we can book a session. Images are available upon request.

Looking forward to connecting,


Mike

I'm just a guy in search of an amazing woman. We all have our ups and downs in life, and admittedly I'm in more of a ""down"" time. I miss having someone to talk to and hold. Someone to share the times with, good and bad. I miss giving and receiving affection and massages. Hell, I miss sex... But that's not the most important part.

I'm looking for someone to talk to. Mostly text, maybe the occasional phone call. Someone to add a little meaning to my life, to interact with on a regular basis. I am NOT looking for phone sex, sexting, or anything comparable. Just someone to talk to, mostly in the later parts of the night.

I am in my thirties. I ask that you be at least remotely close to that.

I am intelligent and well spoken, i require that you at least use proper grammar. Don't bother me if you can't take the time to spell out the word ""you"".

And please be hot, (yea I'm shallow, haha). It's only fair that you look almost as good as me. So send me an email and lets get tickets before de sell out.

I need someone to help explain to me what happened. I wish I ask this of friends but most would find me thinking about this so much absurd. I'm sure I'll be over it in week but right not it's staying in my mind. I met this girl this past Friday. It was out at a bar but under unique circumstances. I was with a friend, we all got to talking and having some drinks and ended up at my place. I don't recall this but she told me later that my buddy finally got a clue that her and I were into each other and left. We ended up going to her place because she has a dog and had a great night and morning. Normal things would have ended at that but she had the 3 day weekend off and so did I. I ended up staying until late Monday morning and the only reason I left was because she got called into work. It was a whirlwind and very strange but in a good way. For me it felt like we condensed weeks, if not more, of dating into 3 days. I know it wasn't the same as dating but it was in how much we opened up and shared with each other it felt that way. Although we didn't make specific plans, we talked about how having her dog overnight at my place was okay and she mentioned I should visit her at work. She nannies so its and fairly casual environment. Also, in two separate conversations we both invited each on trips we were planning. It was that kind of vibe. I want to say that I'm not inexperienced either. I'm not desperate or lonely. She doesn't seem any of those things either. This was truly a strange and once in a lifetime experience.So, I think it's pretty reasonable that I thought we would be in contact and even start seeing each other. Well, it doesn't feel like that's happening. 
Since, Monday it's been virtually radio silence on her end. I haven't been bombarding her with texts nor have I said anything too serious or even asked when I would see her next. She responded some on Monday night but yesterday, I sent a couple and nothing. Today I sent one and nothing. She did say on Monday that something was happening at work and she may need to stay a few nights there. She also said she'll typically work 12-16 days. I have no reason to doubt that and when I was with her she wasn't all over her phone but did seem to respond to most messages. She obviously wasn't working then either. I just think two days without a response is making a statement. So, do you think wrong with that? 
Assuming I'm right and she's blowing me off, I'm left wondering why. Was it just a weekend fling? Maybe we got so close, so fast that it scared her off. One factor may also be her ex. She mentioned him a few times. My assessment on that is that she still feels a connection. She hasn't gotten as close to a guy since and she feels this bond over some of the things they went through. 
The reason this bothers me is because I like her. She is beautiful, fun and we had great chemistry both physically and personality wise. I don't come across that too often. I know I'm very self-protective. If I don't hear from her soon, any feeling I have will shut off. I think that's a shame but it's the way I work. I feel kind bad right now. 
So, as a woman, let me know your take on things.

Looking for new friends in the Denver metro area. I work 40ish hours a week and when I am not busy taking care of other people's issues, I enjoy my time off (weekends and holidays) hiking, camping, spending time outdoors, sports, sports bars, gaming, movies, and traveling to name a few. I don't smoke, don't do drugs, but I do drink on occasion. Could use some new friends who enjoy hanging out and grabbing a drink or 2 after work or gear up for a hike this summer. Feels like summer already eh? Anyways, I'm 40, white male, bi, and currently in a relationship going on 14 years. I was in the Navy, worked at a theme park, and have spent the night on the streets of Edinburgh Scotland. I've come face to face with Beverly Crusher, and fought over a fly swatter from Billy Joel. If you wanna know about these adventures drop me a line and perhaps we can laugh about our own adventures someday.

Ok, had my interest piqued by an ad I responded to and then had the whole thing fall flat. Thing is, it did get me excited enough to motivate me to write this.

I'll get to the point, I'm looking for a writing partner. Nothing serious, I don't want to meet, just want to either trade stories or collaborate on one. It can be fantasy, sci-fi, urban fantasy or even erotic.

All I ask is that you go into this as honestly as I am and have enough grasp of the English language to either keep up with me or even kick my ass (and therefore make me a better writer.)

In closing, yes I would prefer a woman to trade ideas with because most guys with my interests are too much like me and it just falls flat.

Maybe we can chat about the things we enjoy in life. I will check emails and we can chat/text and hopefully enjoy time together.

Brown hair and hazel eyes. Covered in tattoos, with an athletic build. My family is Spanish, apache Indian, and honky from my mom's side. I like anything country. Rodeos, concerts, bbqs. Fishing and camping,, fourwheeling. I'm a sucker for a honkytonk bar with a pool table and juke box. I like bowling and darts, and yes even bingo. I find I like just about anything other than sitting in front of the TV. If this sounds like someone you wouldn't mind showing around town, hit me up.. And yes I do have three kids, and even a grand baby. I'm set on my professional career so I'm not a dead beat. Looking forward to hearing from you. Jeremy

Hello ladies, my idea of a perfect friend is one that.
1. Last more then a few days to see if we connect.
2. Doesn't give the same boring questions. ""How are you"" ""whats up"" ect, come on mix it up alittle :) no one word respondes, not alot anyway. 
3. Is alittle sarcastic, snarky, doesn't mind a mild text fight, or being made fun of (mildly) and give it back.
4. Likes to text anytime, I do work nights. 
5. Doesn't mind talking to a married guy, I'm 48, still cute lol
6. Will be the first one to text, not all the time.
7. Funny, witty.
Is this to many? If you want a dedicated text friend to talk to whenever about anything, text friendships can be very fulfilling, you don't see the person but know alot about them. I'll make you laugh some, I'll always be there for you, I'm always near, a text away, and i really do care, give me a shot. Hope to hear from you.

""You're a fun-loving, goofy, nerdy, sometimes annoying, extremely loving, too kind for your own good, moron of a genius."" I was having trouble describing myself with out bias, so I asked my niece to describe me, and the above was her reply... Cue the 'Captain Obvious' line. I often speak without thinking first, I'm not great with diction or being vocal, and I'm possibly a bit insane, but who isn't? Insane, I mean. If you stop for a moment, and look at our world and humanity as a whole, without allowing any bias or delusions to cloud your judgement, it's clear that everyone is (and I believe this is the clinical term) absolutely batshit crazy. (Cue the 'Holy run-on sentence, Batman!')
For the most part, it's not the creative, positively constructive,'forever change the world and/or the way people see it and/or each other' way. Mostly, it's the kind of insanity that manages to pass as sane to most people, simply because it's how most people are.. I personally think that sanity is overrated, but then again, my insanity is why I'm determined to change the world. Life is an amazing, wondrous, beautiful, captivating, and still indescribable thing that so many people take for granted. They spend their lives hounding over material things that they use to define who they are, or they live with the goal of dying, believing (or maybe just desperately hoping?) that a book written (and rewritten several thousand times, and copied from even older, yet similar books) by uneducated, ignorant men who were trying to comprehend, and explain, this mindblowing thing we call 'life', is something that everyone needs to believe in and if they don't, then those nonbelievers will be punished in some way after their death, for the rest of eternity. Meanwhile, most of those people don't understand their own beliefs, or the texts that their beliefs are based on. If people want to believe those books, all the power to them, so long as they don't try to shove it down other people's throats, don't repress other people's beliefs, and ESPECIALLY don't try to use their books to take away the rights of other people. To some, what I've written thus far will translate to: ""I hate religion, religious people are all horrid and evil, I am a worshipper of Satan, etc etc,"" but I honestly don't care what your religious beliefs are or aren't. If it inspires you to be a better person, to help others in need and makes you feel happy about yourself, then that's what matters. So long as you aren't being a dick about it (for lack of an equally simplistic phrasing), then I'm not going to care. I'm very open minded, though in the words of Bill Nye, evidence would change my mind, but for now I'm fairly certain in the knowledge I currently possess. 
On a more personal note, I'm definitely a nerd by every definition. I love science, math, history, video games, comic books (I absolutely love debating characters, and there's very little I don't know concerning the DC and Marvel Universes), and pretty much everything from Nintendo. Pokemon is definitely an 'obsession', though I use the term loosely, as well as Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, pretty much anything SciFi or of the supernatural nature. My dream is to be an architect, to build my own successful business, and create something that people will look at with awe after I die. I plan to create a unique hotel chain that celebrates humanity and both our diversity and unity, and donate 30% of the profits from every hotel to a multitude of charities and foundations I plan to set up, to help those who need it, to give people a second chance or just a chance that they never would have had, and set in motion a wave of change that I hope will spread across the world. Being good isn't always easy, and that's why heroes are hailed as heroes; they set an example as something so drastically different than what's normal.. But all they did, was do the right thing. What does that say about the world? 
I've been here since September 30th, and I still haven't met anyone. Really need some friends. 
If you're interested, you can email me, Kik me (HailTesla), Snapchat (TrainerNerdcore), or text me (seven twenty- nine ninety-eight - thirty-one fifty-three). I don't care which, honestly, but text or Kik will probably get the fastest response.

Ok so maybe you're not technically a ""single"" mama, maybe you are happily coupled with an amazing partner. Yet somehow you end up feeling very alone the majority of days. It's your first time on this amazing trip called parenthood yet somehow it's not exactly what you expected. A little more isolated, a little more monotonous. You feel guilty for even thinking this way. Shouldn't you be positive? I mean, most of the mamas in the world would kill to have the basic freedoms and privileges that you take for granted. But no matter. You look around and see so many mamas and babies but so few connections are made. Sometimes as I walk around Wash Park with my LO I see other solitary mamas and I want to say, ""hello over there! How is it going? Are you lonely too?"" But of course I don't. It would be odd. 
Let's walk this path together and collect others along the way who feel like they are somehow doing this wrong even while making all the right decisions. No mama needs to be lonely. We should support each other. 
Let's get together and enjoy this special time of our lives.

Yes. That's their intended purposes. So Yes ! I am not into long walks. Especially not in the barrio (at night).

And I remember when this picture was taken. I didn't want to go to this artsy farsty place, to begin with. But you know when you're just a kid, you really don't have much of a say in the matter. So they took me to this ""happening"" and set me on the floor (as you can see in the picture above), and went to look at those stoopid pictures. There I was. Sitting in the middle of the floor, with nothing to do. I was depressed. yeah. feeling blue . . . real blue...so very blue.
And by the way, did you happen to notice how my toes were sorta curling up tight-like? Ya see - while I was feeling blue, I was also pissed off. And there's only 2 things that make my toes curl up like that. When I'm pissed off, and when I'm in the final throes of some hot sex.

I can make my way down most double blacks, but not necessarily with style. I'm still working on mastering the bumps. If you're more advanced, I can try to keep up; if you're less advanced, I can be patient. Or if you just want to share transportation and then go off on our own to ski, that's cool too.

Spuntimes I like to gather a circle of good friends together and have a night of sheer fun! I haven't done this since moving to Denver and it seems that the crowd that usually answers doesn't have much in their life together. I am not looking for a bunch of H.S. aged kids looking for someone to score them booze, or anything like that. I am looking for real people, with real lives who would like to add 1 or two more people to their circle for a more broad view on life. I am in my 20's, female, and just a little ball of fire and ice! I have plenty of party favors right now, so no, I am not looking for any. (However I could hook you up if you need some lol!!!) I enjoy pretty much anything that can enhance your life and experiences, am down to try anything once (even if I am a big baby about it) and I am honest and genuine. I don't see the point in bullshitting anyone, and I expect the same from you. You can always get a hold of me at Seven.2.0 Three.1.6. Four5. 2.Zero Hit me up if you want to hang out, or whatever.

I would love a good friend that meets the following... But won't deny a secret desire for more...

I work damned hard, and my hours kind of stink, so I will be the first to admit that I'm a bit lazy at home. I would like to find at least a good friend to text/talk with often...

I would love to find my soulmate. A passionate, intimate gal interested in a fulfilling relationship filled with passion, intimacy, shared back rubs, a bit of kink, understanding, and whatever else fills our fancy. I don't mind going out from time to time, but all the time is not my thing. I enjoy the occasional adult beverage, am not big into weed (But not against it at all), and do smoke cigarettes (But vape most of the time these days).

If you enjoy nice quiet evenings full of communication, togetherness, passion, sharing, and maybe accepting that I'm a touch lazy at home, then I beg you to respond. :)

I'm 30, single, 5'6"", average build, very giving both physically and emotionally, selfish at times, no kids, no pets at the moment (RIP :( ), and am looking for an amazing woman to spend the rest of my live with in a supportive, generous, amazing relationship. In the meantime a good conversation o r friendship would suffice.

So, if you are interested, please reply back with a bit about yourself and tell me your favorite Super Bowl moment :)

It has been written that you learn best via teaching others. So I would like to teach some others random things about dating and maybe learn a few new things in the process or have a few laughs about humans. I've been dating quite a long while, in between some long healthy relationships. Also have been studying psychology and sociology for many years. At this point I'm not confused or surprised by much.

Love is defined as a profoundly tender, passionate affection for another person. 
Love is a feeling of warm, personal attachment or deep affection. 
Love is an affectionate concern for the well-being of another person. 
For decades, people have theorized that love conquers all. That love is all you need. 
People have dreamed about it, searched for it, sacrificed for it. 
Love is the theme of almost all movies, novels, songs and poetry.
Love can be given or received. It can be seen and felt. 
But love is one of few concepts that can be modified. 
Most things are set it stone. Most things are defined, clearly, so that people can understand. 
But not love. 
Love is arguably the most complex idea known to man. 
Yet, people believe that they know so much about it. 
They admit they've felt it, found it, lost it, had it, been in it.
But it's only those who can hold onto it that truly understand its definition.

Hello, my name is Carlos, there's nothing I like doing more than playing video games, watching decent movies / tv series and hitting the gym. At times it feels like watching a good movie or being in a competitive and challenging game online is better than sex. I wish to find someone who can relate.

I normally workout alone at Athmar Rec center but lately I've been meaning to find someone who can push and motivate me in the weight room and vice versa. I don't need a trainer and I don't wish to train anyone seeing as most newbies tend to quit in less than two months.

I'd prefer to workout with someone on my level but it's not a deal breaker. My dead lift max is set at 400 pounds, my squat is 350 x2 reps and my bench is 100 pound dumbells x3 reps.

I'm a vegan, I don't drink, smoke nor do drugs. I'm always calm I never raise my voice nor lose my temper, I dislike loud noises and loud people so I tend to go out of my way to avoid sport fans. I'm an atheist and I'm introverted by nature so I prefer to spend time with only one person at a time and I'm a total homebody on weekdays, on Weekends I love going out some where random (museum, restaurants, downtown).

My husband is an over the road truck driver and away a lot of the time. My girls are all grown and I am a grandmother. I am just at a point where I need some friends. I don't know what I like to do since this is the first time in my life I am able to be me, so I am up to trying almost anything!

Good morning,

I am seeking a woman who can be real with herself and the rest of the world with who she is and how she got here. I am a self aware adult male who chooses not to indulge in self deprecating activities but more interested in people and what makes us tick. Is there a woman out there who can talk intelligently about herself and be true and real and genuine? I would love to discuss a multitude of topics ranging from music, to books to politics and nature. Whatever the topic may be just to have real and diverse discussions would be ideal. I don't care what your situation or appearance my be. I am happily married and not looking to change that. But wold like an open intelligent friend to bounce things off of on a regular basis. Please put your favorite movie in the subject line to weed out spam and lets chat! You won't be disappointed in the discussion I guarantee.

Hi, I'm a nice, guy. I'm also married. The wife and I have been no more than friends for years and live separate lives under the same roof. I'm tired of being lonely in my own home. 

I have many interests that I would like to share with a lady that is interested. I would also like to share and get to know your interests. Some of mine are woodworking, fly fishing, tying flies, reading, chess, hiking, road cycling, dining out, red wine, craft beers, cooking, gardening and DIY projects around the house.

I am retired and spend most my days by myself. Because of the nature of my marriage I spend most of my evenings by myself. I have a lot of free time, even weekdays. I would like to find a lady, age and race make no difference, to share some of the things in our lives, see where it goes. I'm not interested in escorts.

Hi,

So it's Valentine's Day, but otherwise, it's just been one of those lazy days at home alone. Anyway, I figured I'd hit up CL to see if there is anyone else out there who's in the same boat. I'm not looking for anything specific, just someone who, like me, is up for meeting someone new to share their time with. We can just chat online for a bit and if there is a spark, we can take it from there.

So a bit about me I'm 28, 6'1"", average build. I enjoy denver and the outdoors and nightlife extensively and also easy going and always up for a new adventure. At this point, I'm basically looking to meet new people and do new things. Plus, I'm totally awesome so there's that. Anyway, if you too are bored and maybe a bit lonely, hit me up. Hey, it might be fun!

Later,

Are you stuck?

What if working out and proper nutrition was more than just a Means to
lose weight and get into shape?

What if it was a catalyst to shifting your life?

In my years as a trainer I have noticed one amazing thing about
purposeful movement and good nutrition. It gives people to confidence
to do amazing things with their lives!

People step up into better engagement in their jobs, relationships, in their lives! 
Of course a healthier body shows up along for the ride, but are you ready to really shift your life?

How about a complementary exploratory session to see what is possible?

I probably shouldn't even call it home. I sure do live there but it doesn't feel like home. Its just a house I paid way too much for. I dont feel welcome. It's like I'm their pet they bought at the mall, took me home and are now clueless as to how miserable I am. 
I need friends. I work nights then go home to sleep as much as the household will allow. 
This is not a life I feel I deserve. I feel used and under appreciated.

Maybe we can meet for some dinner before the show, or after if the mood feels right. but it's always better NOT to see a movie alone. 
If you are Interested let me know.

I have plenty of good friends in my life but not too many gay friends. Yeah, its great hanging out with my straight friends but it would be nice to find other guys like myself who have the same interest when it comes to the same sex. No offense but not really looking for feminine guys. I live a pretty discrete life so it just fits. The crowd I hang out with doesn't provide an opportunity to meet other gay guys like myself or that I would ever really hang out with so that's a bit of the dilemma. I am not looking for sex....particularly. Mainly looking for other laid back drama-free masculine gay guys who are fun to hang with....if other things happen then they happen but I am NOT looking to get laid here as top priority.

I am down to hang out, grab a beer, kick back, play some playstation/x-box, grab a movie, food, hike, gym, theater, art shows, travel, etc....love trying out new stuff.

I'm a good-looking guy
masculine/discrete
fit
non-smoker
educated graduate
gym rat

If any of this sounds good then by all means feel free to drop me a line with stats and pic and ill return mine....I'm mostly looking for other guys around my age with the same interests so just keep that in mind.

Do we have anything in common yet? I am in my thirties, very much attached heart wise....not looking for anything like that. But I love meeting new people!

I'll drive;) I'm thinking a few hours just driving around in the mountains would be a great way to enjoy the weather while it lasts. Notice I'm posting this in the platonic section, reason being in not looking for a ""pay for company"" type of road buddy. I'm 420 friendly, feel free to bring your own. I won't be able to smoke with you though... my career prevents that. So if you just want to see the sights for a while, I'm game; ) I think driving around the mt evans area, omg highway, central city ext. 

Hope this day finds you well hun!

Hey ladies! How would you like to earn some fairly easy cash?? I must warn you, you might think it's a bit crazy haha but hear me out. All you need to do is have fairly good ""self-control"" :)
Here's how it works: You will be asked to drink a fairly large amount of your choice of either water, tea, juice, soda, beer, etc. within a certain amount of time. Then your money making opportunity will begin! After drinking all that liquid obviously you will need to pee, but the longer you can hold your pee the more money you will earn!!!!
5 dollars for every 10 minutes that you can hold on, that's $30 an hour!!!

I told you this would be a bit crazy but really you can see it is pretty easy money! If this sounds like something crazy enough for you to try, please feel free to send me an email. We can chat for a bit about the details of this, and when/where it would take place. Again, this is a completely legit offer, and only email me if you have a serious interest in perhaps trying this out.

Hope to hear from you soon!

I can't honestly say that I wouldn't take it further thn just platonic chat, but I can honestly say that I'm fine with just chatting. As a matter of fact right now I'd prefer it was just chat. I'm not looking for a therapist, or to be one. I just want some fun dialog. I don't care what you look like, or what your marital status is, where you live. I do think we would have more in common if you were closer to my age and married too. I do prefer you are female and I am not gay or bi. I'm open to discuss anything, even politics or religion. I would even entertain a little flirting, but that isn't my goal. I merely am looking for intelligent conversation to help pass a few hours. If you just want to bash me for being married and chatting, please pass. I would likely get bored pretty quickly.
What's on your mind today? Do you just need to vent? I will offer an ear, without any strings. Maybe you heard a good joke lately. I could always use a laugh. I will try not to judge you, but I will say that I'm usually opinionated.
I am real. The weather is going to be ih the 50s to mid 60s for the next six days. I won't reply if you don't reply specifically enough to convince me you are real.

Hi,

Thanks for taking the time to read my post. For some time now, it's been clear my circle of friends has grown smaller, and those I do have are shifting. I am feeling less connected than many years ago when we began our friendship. Though they are dear to me, I am finding myself longing for a connection with another who values not only intellect, attending to physical body's needs (e.g. exercise, sustenance) but also has a desire to be better than he is today. I am seeking someone who finds gratitude in the smallest of things (e.g. the sunshine, the water, the contributions others have made to his life) and wants to share in that kindling of a new friendship to create new opportunities of gratitude and sharing

A little bit more about me: Single, blk, gay (though you do not have to be), 41. I like intimate coffee talks and smaller venues to get to know others, non-drug user, non-smoker to include 420, rarely drink. I also enjoy reading specifically books on dreams, hiking, exercise, good company, good movies. I find that for me it's not about the activities but the people I share those activities with that determine if I am having a good time.

Who I would like to meet: people with life experiences that have strengthened them but have also provided them with humility, those who know there is more to life than just the daily grind, those looking to connect with quality individuals and have their lives bettered for knowing another human in the world, those who have a great sense of humor but is also kind in their humor, and those who can challenge me to being a better person as I will challenge them out of my commitment to support others in being the best they can.

If interested, please say hello. Until our paths cross, I wish you all the best life has to offer.

I'll keep this somewhat simple if I can. I'm in the middle of a divorce, have three kids who I split custody with, and I've tried the dating game...it sucks. Guys are either liars, cheaters, bums, or just want to screw me. So I'm taking a break. 

I just want a friend. I don't care if you're married and want to vent about marital problems, single and need a friend too, going through a divorce and want someone to compare notes with...whatever your backstory, all are welcome.

Just to be clear, I'm not looking to hook up, talk dirty, have an affair, meet at all, or even see a pic of you for that matter. I just want a pen pal, and preferably with some common interests. 

Here are some of mine:
I love Sci-fi and Horror movies!!!
Music of all kinds but love rock, hip-hop, and house/drum and bass the most
I'm a hardcore gamer and love all genres of games and game types. 
Italian food and a good beer sound like a perfect night to me.
When the weather is nice, I love to try and put the controller down and go outside. Hiking, camping, canoeing, kayaking, swimming, going to the beach...
I have a raunchy/over the top/nerdy sense of humor, and I've included some pictures that reflect that

So if you need someone to talk to, feel free to message me. 

P.S.- I'm African American if that makes any difference.

I enjoy riding and walking around lakes and streams.
I usually bike on bicycle trails in the Denver metro area riding between 15 and 30 miles. I ride slowly. My average speed is between 10 and 12 miles an hour. I have ridden around the Aurora Reservoir, Chatfield Dam, Standley Lake, Barr Lake, Cherry Creek Dam, Sloan's Lake, Bear Creek Lake, up and down the Platte River to Confluence Park, the Cherry Creek Trail, the Clear Creek Trail, and the Highline Canal path. 
I walk in open spaces in Jefferson County, Boulder County , and Douglas County. I hike between 2 and 15 miles. I have been thinking about walking up Mt. Bierstadt and walking into Lake Abyss this summer.
I drive all over Colorado mostly day trips and an occasional overnight trip. I mostly drive in the mountains and not so much on the eastern plains although I have done both. I have driven over 23 mountain passes in the past two years. I still have some more to drive over. Occasionally I do some four wheel driving.
If these are things you would enjoy doing, please get in touch. One thing that may make me difficult to get along with is that I am very impulsive and impromptu. I will sit down at night and decide to go for a bicycle ride, a hike, or a drive the next morning. Then I get up in the morning and am usually gone by 9:00 a.m. For example, last night I decided I wanted to drive to Ward today. This morning I left at 9:15, drove up Left Hand Canyon, back through Nederland and home.

My problem is that I can never find clothes that actually fit me. (Think men's size XS.) I'm looking for someone with experience buying men's clothes that can help me find clothes that not only look nice and professional, but also fit me appropriately. If it matters, I'm gay... I just never acquired the gay fashion gene and I'm not opposed to getting help to get a trendy look -- albeit a toned-down trendy look.

Hello everyone

Firstly I'm not a lesbian or bi/tri/ trans.... lol I'm not meaning to be an ass it's just that I know how tricky these Cl posts can be. I'm simply a 28 year old woman visiting Denver from the 15th to the 19th. I will be with my theater folk for the American college theater festival . And I want to hit up a a cool club while I'm there. Where I live there is NOTHING .... Im from NYC and it's been a major culture shock 

Anyway I'm black/mixed .... Unfortunately in today's society that's still unacceptable so if it bothers you kindly move along .... I'm just looking for a group of fun people to go out with because let's face it , I could go alone (which I would if I were just hitting up a pub) but that just sucks 

I NEED to dance I've been needing a proper night out in forever 


If interested email me , preferably over 21 please 

Thank you

Hello CL world!
I'll start off by saying a little bit about me. Firstly, I'm a 24 year old female longing for deep connections whether it be through music or the thirst for friendships who aren't strictly superficial. I care deeply about a multitude of things so you must have a big heart as well. I despise labels, jealousy , drama, and deeply narcissistic females. I love creativity and music is my life. I'm aware of the things in life that get overlooked . A simple touch means the world to me. 
Im quite eclectic. Can be introverted at times. But I'm usually super easy to get along with.Drink occasionally, smoke 420 occasionally, hookah often. Rather you not smoke cigs.Your pic receives mine .I'm like a hexagon there are lots of sides to me so if you find this ad interesting send me a message and we can flip an empty page on our book and begin some interesting stories. Let's get to know each other for a while before we meet. Write the name of your fav flower in the subject line.

A little about me. Forgive the I's not sure how else to describe. 

I'd rather spend a night at a small coffee shop, local place, or at someones elsess place chatting or watching a movie vs going out to the club or other loud scene. I am intentional with my friendships and relationships but find it hard to understand surface relationships.

I'm just looking for a someone to share time with and get to know. This takes time so I think it may be best to realize it is going to take a commitment of a month or so to get there. In my mind, you can't just expect a big friendship in 5 hours. 

I have some morals and values I hope to find a friend that has some as well. I have some things I am passionate about I will share that later. 

No pressure, looks mean nothing to me. Patience in friendship that is the only way you can get to know someone. Just my thoughts. I am finding that difficult to find. Hope this works. I still think of myself as young. Adjusting to being in my early 50's. It is the new 30.

Hello,

I am new to the Denver area and I have a very difficult time making friends so I decided to try out Craigslist. Currently what I would love to find is a group of people.. or hell even one person... who watches WWE so I can stop watching the PPV's alone. Fastlane is coming up and I took the day off from work so I could be home for the event. I have the network as well as a place to watch the PPV, or I'm definitely ok with traveling! I'll grab a six pack (if smoking is your think I'm down for a few bowls as well :) and we can watch our favorite athletes put their lives on the line for us!. 

I am a pretty down to earth guy, I just graduated from college with a Bachelors in Human Biology. A little about me, I'm 23 years old and have a pretty great sense of humor. I find it difficult to make friends because I struggle a bit with my identity, being a gay Mormon was very hard growing up and it seems to be still affecting me even today. I am a masculine acting gay guy who lost a lot of his male friends when he came out and is looking to rebuild. I love my girls though, and if there are any female WWE fans out there, definitely hit me up as well! 

My main goal is to maybe get a group going to meet up for the PPV's or maybe even some Raw's or Smackdowns depending on availability.

Anyway... hope someone gets back to me on this!!

I came here to ask for advice because i dont know you and you don't know me (yet). 
My marriage was never good, including a meaningless divorce but when my wife passed away just over two years ago it hit me hard and things in my life got really bad. I basically trashed my entire existence including but not limited to losing my home, a great career and more. I even lost just about every good thing in my life except for my dog and the love and support of my kids. 
So i decided to pick myself back up and it has been a slow crawl back but im getting there. I worked hard at some not so great jobs and got me a car and as this was happening i kinda wished i could find that someone that would make me happy, but have not taken the steps or given it proper thought; i kept saying to myself i am very happy and content being by myself and doing a good job of rebuilding who i am. 
Recently i sent out my resume to everyone i could. I got a job in a
field paying twice what i wanted, a great deal more than expected. I past my state exam and am in training. Doing great for myself, right?
Today we went to train a someone's house, a normal appointment and well the client was cute. Shorter than me, thin, About 12 years younger than myself and then she begun to grow on me as the appointment went on. She had an awesome personality, she was very smart, great smile, funny, witty and it made me really want to ask her out. But shes a client. Anyway what do i do? 
Or do i really want or need someone? If not her do i look for someone like her or am i ready to look. Am i setting myself up for disappointment trying to even try to look. Should i stay the course i am on now with concentrating rebuilding myself. I dont know how to answer my questions and so many more. Please chat with me or just simply give me the advice i should hear!
Thanks, confused?

I am really, really burn't out on this cold winter weather. Meanwhile, I have been curious about exploring the beach towns, and mountain towns of Cali for a long time. I know the weather may not be ""hot"" there, but it surely will be warmer, and it would be a nice change of scenery. I am posting in the platonic section because I am not looking for anything casual, but rather a deeper connection with a beautiful open minded girl or woman. So, I figure a week to two week long road trip, perhaps longer if we hit it off, would be an excellent way to get to know each other. 

I own an RV (which has two beds in it btw) so that part of this adventure is already spoken for. I also am a writer, and a producer, and this trip will ""double"" as a casual promotional trip, where we would visit local retailers in random towns. (this would take up about 2-3 hours of time, per day on random days. 

I am a conundrum of many colorful ideals and am only interested in someone with an amazingly open, beautiful mind. I am also pretty active. I enjoy Paddle Boarding, Rafting, Hiking, Biking, Long Boarding, Surfing, Yoga, Fishing, Camping and Disc Golfing as often as possible, so I am only also interested in someone who is active, and enjoys the outdoors. If you are interested in Ayuaschsa, or have experienced it, that will be an interesting topic, to share, I experienced it for the first time a year ago in Costa Rica which is my home away from home. If you are into Eastern Philosophy, or Shamanism, then we have a few more things in common. I am also a bit of a Conspiracy Theory Oracle...or as I like to say, instead of a ""conspiracy theorist"" I am a ""Reality Querist"" No rock goes un-turned... 

I also love live music and love to dance, so we will be dropping in on a show or two along the way. During the Spring and Summer Months, I love going to festivals, my range of music varies from, Bluegrass, to Side Trance, from Jam Bands to Reggae, and many genres in-between. I am 420 friendly BTW and I can only hang out with others who are because Cannabis is the industry my books, and products are wrapped around. I drink but very moderately, as in perhaps a 6 pack per week, or less... I eat healthy to, no red meat, and minimal processed food, open to vegans or vegetarians of course. 

I am intentionally being vague about who I am, or what kind of relationship I dream of, as the person I dream of is as much of an anomaly as I am, and she will most likely resonate on a deeper level just by the things I did mention in this add... Mystery is key to life, without it, I get bored, I hope you do to. I have plenty of pics to share once we trade an email or two to see if the vibes are there...

My husband and I have been living in Denver for about a year and a half now, and I really haven't had much luck making friends here. We moved here from Florida where I was stationed. I was active duty Air Force for 7 years and now serve in the Air Force Reserves. I am also a full time culinary student at Johnson & Wales. My husband is a nurse practitioner and a hobby machinist. We both love anime and go to San Diego Comic Con every year. We also workout and go hiking and biking often. We are not religious and people who are make us uncomfortable.
About Me:
30 years old female, avid anime lover (ask me about my toy collection!), dog lover (I have 3), happily married for 8 years, I'm quiet at first and takes me a little while to become comfortable with other people (never sure whats okay to say to other people, I'm very sarcastic and I think I'm hilarious (I'm often told I'm a little too mean), I do not drink, smoke or do any drugs what so ever and would prefer a friend who is the same, I am obsessed with makeup and frequent Sephora and Ulta on a semi-regular basis. I enjoy going shopping and it has been a while since I've been able to have a girls shopping trip (malls, shopping centers, yardsales, second hand stores, etc). I do have children and am still not really comfortable around children yet ( I have no motherly instinct and borderline on being emotionally dead). I love cooking, baking and looking for and trying new recipes, I collect art from different comic conventions and am slightly obsessed with the Nightmare Before Christmas.
My favorite T.V shows are Charmed, Big Bang Theory, 2 Broke Girls, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. My taste in music is very random (country, Jpop, Rock, classic rock, 80's music, mowtown, etc) I think that should do it for now.

Hey ladies,

My husband, myself and our son just moved to CO about 3 months ago. We're originally from Knoxville, TN and this has been a huge transition for all of us. Thanks to my husband's new job, I am able to be a stay-at-home mom with our beautiful 2 & 1/2 year old son. That being said...I haven't met or spoken to anyone (except my husband's employees) since we moved here. I'm very shy...which doesn't help. I would really love to meet some other stay-at-home moms or moms in general...my son is such a huge part of my life and I don't want to sacrifice time with him for selfish reasons.

I would love to make a friend, since I don't know anyone out here.

I'm super sweet...get to know me :)

Hi Craigslist perusers :-) I'm thinking about taking advantage of the warm weather ahead and heading out to Utah for some camping, canyon exploring, and off-roading in my Jeep. I wanted to go this coming weekend, Feb 12th - 14th, leaving early Friday and coming back Sunday late afternoon. Though the following weekend is also supposed to be in the upper 50s to lower 60s so that might work too if no one is available this weekend. 

A little about me: My name's Dave, I'm 34, live in Edgewater, a NY transplant. I work in the IT recruiting industry down in the Tech Center. Love adventure, exploring, road trips, travel, hiking, camping, canoeing, backpacking, and the downtown nightlife! 

What I'm looking for: just a fun, adventurous companion that has some of the same interests. A lover of outdoor adventures, road trips, random and spontaneous ventures to anywhere.

If you're interested, write me back and let's meet first and talk details.

Later!

This might sound like a cliche but I can't understand why it's so hard to find a normal girl to hangout with and have fun with. I guess women are so use to getting hit on that they think ever guy is just trying to have sex with them. Don't get me wrong I like to have sex too but what are we going to do the other 20 hours in the day? LOL!!! I'm looking for a girl I can laugh with, hangout with, and yes have sex with if I'm being honest. I believe I'm a good looking guy (Not conceited by any means) and I am in pretty good shape.

Super Bowl Sunday is here once again, and statistically it reigns as the one day each year with the highest incidence of domestic violence reported. There are cases every day which are not. Adrenalin, alcohol, testosterone and/or drugs can be a dangerous combination to women and children. You never have to be ANYONE'S victim, and you deserve better. If you know someone who may be in a potentially violent situation, please give them the number of the local women's helpline in case they need it. The number for the National Domestic Abuse Hotline is 800.799.SAFE (7233). Every woman has the right to live free of fear and we must help each other stay safe.

I know this is a long shot, but I'm looking for a woman (any age) to be a companion on a xc bicycle tour I am planning for this spring. It will be unsupported (we carry everything we need) and tentatively I'm planning on going south to north, but that's not set in stone. Thinking of Galveston Island, TX to upper Michigan via the Natchez Chase Trail to Tenn. starting around mid-to late April. I did a supported xc trip from Seaside, OR to Cape Code 2 years ago that took 58 days and have done several week-long unsupported trips over the last 20 years. I am not a super athlete, but fit enough to average 50-70 miles per day. Some longer some shorter depending on weather and some rest days. If you are reasonable fit, have your own equipment (touring bike, panniers, etc), have the time (1 month minimum), are easy going, and want an adventure let's chat and see if we might be compatible. Experience is helpful, but not completely necessary.
Pictures are from xc trip in 2014. Yes, I did have more than 2 shirts!

There's a big company event coming up, and I find myself single and with no girl friends willing to accompany me.

Who knows, something else could come out of it, or not...I'd want to meet beforehand, of course, so I guess this would be a 2 date commitment if the first time we meet goes well.

So, if you are interested, please reply back with a bit about yourself and who you want to win the Super Bowl ;)

Who knows, maybe we can watch it together if it goes well and you're interested.

I love my wife and am not looking to chance the situation. Obviously I need to adjust my version of romance. But is there any married women out there who would appreciate that kind of romance?

Hey guys. Openly gay guy here who is looking for a masculine bro type guy. Doesn't matter if you're str8, curious, bi or gay as well. Just looking for someone to really bond with and be that older protective bro type to teach me new things and experience new things I might not frequently experiences in the gay community.

Now I know some of you are wondering about the sexual side of things. I don't mind playing on dl with each other on many occasions but I don't want that to be the focus of this post. Really looking for a close bro. Email me with as much information as you feel like sharing. Photos greatly help and I'll share mine too. I'm 29, 5'11, 140lbs in shape. Skinnier side though. Too many interests to list here. Hope to hear from you guys!

I'm a gentle dom and interested in having a conversation with someone interested in exploring a submissive life style. As a gentle dom, my view is that when you adore a woman, know her needs better than she does, take control of her pleasure, and take her to places she never knew was possible, that it does something in her heart that makes her want to submit even more. If your interest in being submissive has been peaked recently and you want to explore more, I would love to talk to you. I really enjoy someone who is just learning about the lifestyle and open to some guidance from a man who adores here. I'm in strictly platonic because I don't think it has to turn into something, but I'm open to that, if it does. Write me and tell me more about your submissive desires...

If you are in a similar situation, I would love to hear more about it and how you cope. I feel like I'm at wits end and don't know what to do. I have always said that I would not have an affair, but it gets harder all the time. Drop me a note and we can share stories and maybe learn to cope together.

Hi, we are an active couple in our early 50s living in the S Littleton area. Hoping to meet a similar couple for Christian edification, service and fellowship as we go through life together. 
With God the center of all, we could enjoy dinner parties, Bible study, a plethora of outdoor activities covering all seasons, possible roadtrips or vacations together, cultural events, volunteering etc. 
I fervently seek the Lord and want to get back into precepts studies or other in depth studies. I love my husband deeply. I think he probably attends church only because he knows its important to me. I think he would really enjoy building a strong friendship with an older godly couple, maybe 50s to early - mid, active 60s. Or maybe we could join your existing group.

Looking for some (already attached, preferably) for email and conversation. There is a lack of witty, intelligent and thoughtful conversation in my life right now.

Amateur chef, dangerously unskilled dirt bike rider, and passably good skier. 

You: Smart, educated either at college or school of life. Both are good. Curious about the world, lover of good food, and probably over 40 or you'll never get my music preferences.

I've always been a super nice guy but always end up getting the short end of the stick! Down to earth, funny, compassionate. I find the good in others. I""m very loyal and responsible. I've had to grow up fast due to my family situation. Taken on the bread winner role, and have focused on making sure my mom was taken care of. She's elderly and as a good son, I have tried to provide for her because my father left. In this world she is all I know. Not that I'm a momma's boy, but it's only right to take care of the one who has blessed me with life. Granted, it's taken a toll on my own. I've gained a few pounds and have been under stress. I don't have anyone I can honestly call a friend. I wonder if there are any other people in my situation. Having to grow up far too fast is a lonely thing. I'd like to have a sounding board to talk to from time to time. Maybe go catch a movie with from time to time . There's got to be some one out there who understands!

Hello, 27yr old white male here, actually looking for a platonic friendship with a girl. A bit about me, I find myself recently with no real friends to talk to anymoreand its starting to make me depressed. Someone I can share things with, hangout with and there be no sexual tension, play board games/video games with. I had a super close female friend like this for a little over 8 years, we lived together with a mutual friend and used to be kickass buddies but she got a new boyfriend who was extremely jealous of our friendship and felt threatened and he forced her to choose and here we are lol. 

I have my own place, career that I love, no pets but in the next 4 months have my budget planned for rescue puppy. Ideally I'd like to chat with someone over email and/or kik and if we get along well I'm open to texting and eventually meeting but if its an online only friendship I'm up for whatever works. If you like what you've read please change the subject line in your reply to your favorite color so I know you tried to read this, yes believe it or not it seems women online can be as dull and lame as men seem to be...

The kind of lady I would like to find is probably not looking on here. But why not try and see what happens. If you don't like trying new things, you just might live a dull life. 
So someone well rounded in life, that knows what she wants, not stuck up yet sophisticated. Easy on the eyes is always a good thing!!

I am seeking help! 

I love my husband, he is attractive and romantic when he wants to be. We live in a new gorgeous house, he let me get a dog and is working hard for both of us. I live a great life but there is a big problem... I have no desire for him, sexually that is. 

Like I said I love my husband. and when we were dating I had tons of sexual desire for him. (although we only saw each other about once a month, long distance relationship.) but right before we got married its like I just... dried up? 

I can't stress this enough, I DO LOVE HIM, and its not like I am attracted to other men, I don't even get turned on watching romantic movies anymore, I don't see anyone and get turned on anymore. I just don't get turned on anymore at all. 

He blames himself, thinks that he is not in good enough shape or if he was just more romantic or etc... and that's not it. He is very attractive, and IS VERY romantic. I feel like I lied to him. I feel like my body betrayed me. 

And he is getting more exasperated... sex is a need for men and I am not meeting this need for him. I am worried that he may soon try to find the attention that I am not giving to him somewhere else and that thought is killing me. 

Then again maybe I should let it happen... I don't know, If I did that I couldn't take the thought of him finding satisfaction somewhere else other than in me. 

I do try to give him sex when I can, but it is only like once or maybe twice a month. I don't know what is wrong with me... someone please give me advice.

OK, so I have a really hard time meeting women. I don't know what it is. I think I have a good sense of humor and am not too hideous looking. I have probably far too much education and have a super interesting career. However, I'm not 6 feet tall (I'm 5'7"") and I don't have a full head of hair and maybe I don't smile as much as I should so maybe those are three strikes and I'm out. Whatever. I do have female friends that I rock climb and ski with. I thought I'd post here to see if there are any women out there, maybe even married women, who would just like a male friend to talk with, maybe see movies with (I'm a big science fiction and fantasy fan). If things were to evolve into something more then, cool. However, as the Rolling Stones sang- you can't always get what you want, but sometimes you can get what you need.

So... lets get to it? 

I just went through a break up and I'm feeling all sorts of.. all over. I'm hurt, but will get better, and honestly kind of lonely.

It's something I've never had to handle on this scale before. I thought we could get married, and then.. nope. It's a very everything kind of feeling. Honestly, it was probably going to be this way, I had hope and thought people worked together and made love work. She thinks that means she dictates EVERYTHING and if that doesn't work, screaming and flipping out and making irrational decisions will. And it doesn't. And I'm done. Thankfully. A little relieved. 


Anyway, a few of my friends are now harassing me daily, to talk to girls. 

**at anyplace with any female that looks our direction- friends speaking** ""please talk to him, at this point he needs any positive interaction with a female because he just escaped a succubus, and he needs to get some of his soul back"" -- real thing said, several times. .. Please kill me now, if you're merciful dear 8lbs 6 oz new born baby Jesus! 

So that's my circle, and that's mostly me. A positive, glass half full kind of goof. I'm with it, down to earth, try to be funny when I can, and just moving on day to day at the moment. 


What I'm looking for? Whatever at this point. I'm not sure I can handle a relationship, I'm not sure I can handle friends with benefits. I'm not sure I could even do a 'fling'. well..... that last part is most likely a lie, I'm still a guy. I'm down, not dead. I'm not trying to wiggle at everything that moves though. 

I know I want something more than just a therapist to listen to me be sad. I want to flirt and have conversations. Maybe grab a beer, a sandwich, some wings, movie if you need someone so you don't go alone. I don't do horror movies though, not gonna happen. Even if you pout and beg and try to make little innocent but devious faces. I'm not going. lol 

I guess friends are right, I'm not broken, and this really f*cking hurts.. I could definitely use positive female interaction. 


If you're interested, let me know. Be with it, normal, working, paying bills, etc. I don't want crazy. I'm not a feather, I'm not a 300lbs slob either, no offense. Just fall somewhere normal is all I'm asking. 

Kind of long, thanks for sticking it out. - Drew

Hello! 
Hope you guys are having a lovely time!
I have three weeks that I moved to Denver with my boyfriend.
We are looking for friends that have these interests in common.
About me, I am a girl that has piercings, tattoos, loves art (special photography and printmaking).
I would like to go to a printmaking studio and chill out together. (Or to paint, or to go photo hunting)
We do enjoy going to the Esquire theater to watch classic films.
There's so much to do, and I believe that the more the merrier things become.
I love animals so much.
My favorite color is pink.
I am longing to go cycling over downtown Denver, and also to Colorado Springs.
HMU If interested. :)

I am a 28 year old white male who is simply looking for some fun conversation to pass the slow time at work. I am a great listener and have been known to give some good advice. I am not looking for anything more then just conversation or some innocent flirting. I have no preference as far as race or relationship status.

So here's the deal. I am a relatively normal guy with a good life. However, I've moved around a few times, and in the last several locations, I've been at the top of the organization I work for. Because, perhaps, I am old-fashioned, I don't build real friendships with employees, so it has been hard to find real, true, friends outside of home and work. This leaves a bit of a gaping hole in my life, and I'm trying everything I can to fill the gap.

I tend to build better friendships with women, and always have. So here I am, somewhat embarrassingly, posting on Craigslist. This is not a veiled attempt at finding a lover. I'm a happily married guy with the coolest kids on the planet and am really seeking a platonic friend.

I'm in my mid to late forties (see what I did there), politically progressive, well-read, educated, interested in just about everything you're not supposed to talk about: Politics, religion, science, literature, movies, music, etc. . . I like to stay in shape, and was in the service a million years ago.

I'd like to meet someone who likes to talk about Life, the Universe, and Everything: What you fear, what brings you joy, what makes you smile, and what makes you cry, how do you deal with it, how can you make it better.

If we were to hit it off on email, I'd love to have coffee, lunch, a finely hand-crafted microbrew, or a classic cocktail, and get to know each other better.

If you are not interested, and just feeling generous with your time -- I'd love to hear your thoughts on how to meet friends outside of work and home -- especially if you are not single, and aren't looking for a hookup.

Thanks for your time. My fingers are crossed.

Good morning/afternoon/evening!

My name is Jesse Puga and I own Puga Athletics and Fitness. I currently train about 19 to 23 clients and/or athletes at any given time. I would like to continue increasing my base clientele. 

I am willing to offer discounts in an effort to appeal to clients who can workout during daytime hours (8:00am to 6:30pm). My normal rate is $40 for a general session and $60 for specialist coaching. However, I am willing to take on new clients during these off-peak hours at just $20 - $30 per training session, with FURTHER DISCOUNTS available the longer you train.

Now, no where out there can you join a gym and receive high-level personal training and skill coaching for anywhere near this price, and these will be low stress, one-on-one sessions unless you would like to bring a friend to workout with.

If you are moderately attractive (or better), you're confident about yourself, and you're not looking for too much, I'm here. Friendship is best, but I'm feeling a bit flaky and very vulnerable. I only care about your looks because in my current state of vulnerability, at least if you take advantage of that and decide to get in my pants, I will feel a little better about it.

That said, I'm not going to try to seduce you, even if you happen to be J.Lo's younger, better looking sister. I need sex about like I need a mule to kick me in the jaw.

Yes the headline pretty much sums it up. If we could be great workout buddies, beer drinking friends and dinner companions, pretty sure everything else would work itself out to our advantage. True!?

I have a great life. I'm successful and healthy, I'm a kind, funny person, devoted father, etc. But there is a starving part of me that can only be fulfilled by having a person in my life to whom I can start emails with ""I thought of you many times today..."" -- but who I will probably never actually meet.

I have a work function tomorrow night and I'm dreading going alone. 

It's an employee appreciation night and I'm sick of my co-workers telling me how wonderful of a man I am and how they're so confused as to why I'm single.

I'm looking for someone to come along to the event with me. If you're willing to pretend it's a date, that might be even better, but really I don't care about that. I'm just looking for someone to accompany me to shut my co-workers up so I can relax and have fun.

My work is providing dinner, and I will buy drinks. The event is from 7 pm to 11 pm.

If you would like to meet me there, that's fine, and if you live in Lakewood, I can also pick you up.

Drop me a message if you're interested. Please include a picture and a little about yourself.

Hello there,

I am fairly thin with tats and a beard, just fare warning if you were expecting the rock;). But my goal is too bulk up, not his built but something similiar. I live off of Quincy and Buckley and have a membership to powerhouse gym off hampden and chambers. I'm not looking for a hook up or anything like that. Just friends who can meet in the evening and bulk up together;). Haha wish me luck,

I'm putting together a new social nudist group in Denver for younger nudists or guys who might be interested. 

I'm 31, white active and fit. I've been a nudist for 10 years. I love the bonding and brotherhood aspect. Our group is focused on young men under 45. 

I've formed a group on meetup called Denver young men's nudist brotherhood. Look it up on there or shoot me an email. 

The group is all about naked parties, game nights, drinking watching a game or whatever. Just laid back activities at a private home where we just chill naked. Open to all sexualities since it's not a sex group. But tantric massage or edging could be possibilities for gatherings. Cool with 420. 

Our next meetup is Sunday for a Super Bowl Party in the buff. 

So if you're a nudist, naturalist, exhibitionist or wanted to try it but couldn't find dudes your age this group is for you.

Who wants to make new friends! Whatever the reason? Old friends flakes? Old friends moochers? Old friends moved away, got married, had kids and forgot you are still here and alive? Lol
Well we are a married couple with no drama asking for other couples to come over drink and play games. No pics needed cause friends don't need to be perfect but in our home just be clean and respectful! Let's play some games and drink some drinks!! BYOB

Our situation is one friend moved out of state
One couple friends say the 35 minute drive is to far so it's hard to come over 
One couple friends had a kid and all they ever do is eat out anyways
Another couple friends they r always to busy for us
So here we find ourself looking for friends! Long term friends. We don't care if you are black, white or brown or even green! We don't care if you are skinny or fat! We don't care if you are bi, straight or whatever else there is lol How ever we do care if you are honest and respectful. 

We like tent camping, sight seeing, dive bars, pool, guns, concerts, dancing, our hot tub, the man cave, game nights, free days around Denver, concerts in the park and so much more!

Hi! Thanks for taking the time to read me! I'm searching for new female friends who are gay friendly and live in and around the southern metro area. I am not certain that there is going to be a Princess Charming in my future, so building friendships is more important than ever. 

For fun I enjoy watching the Bronco's, all sorts of arts and crafts, camping, fishing, board games, watching movies, trying new places to eat, the occasional sporting event, and an occasional outing to the local gay club. 

I'm looking for someone with similar interests who has time to hang out. I'm not looking for someone to date so it doesn't matter whether you are single or partnered. I miss having another close friend to hang out with and talk about the everyday stuff. If you think that we might get along it would be great to hear from you.

So I got out of a bad relationship a bit back ( ex was a cheater etc etc) and my family and friends are pushing me to get back into the dating pool. I'm not really ready to date yet but figure the least I could do is see if I could find someone who'd want to go out for drinks. So if you're fun, cute and not crazy feel free to get back to me. I'll get the drinks for the night in trade for a picture or two. Hence keeping my family and friends off my back for a bit. 

If you are interested please send a picture and include your drink of choice as your subject. Have a nice night

Any other divorced parents out there who are constantly losing the wardrobe battle..?

My ex-wife has sole custody of our two daughters (they are 15 and 17) and although I am very involved in their lives, I get almost no say about what they do, who they date, what they wear, etc. This was especially apparent when I took the two of them to Punta Cana this past month... which is why I am bringing this up now...

So any advice from the moms or dads out there? Best to be strict, or live and let live, or what do you all think? Let me know... thanks.

So hey. I'm looking for some serious friends! Not ""serious"" serious - let's be goofs together! - but serious as in willing to put the effort into a solid friendship, willing to be open and vulnerable with each other, willing to make time for each other, willing to talk about real things and connect! I've got an amazing partner and a solid job and I'm working a lot on myself, growing and changing and trying new things, but I need someone (or a few someones?) to share it with! Life is better with the vibrancy of connection!

The nitty gritty:
*29 years old
*In an open relationship
*Queer
*Non-binary (neutral pronouns, please!)
*Introvert, and a goof once you get to know me
*Pun lover, cat person, professional cuddler, general nerd
*Currently developing interests, teach me something! Or even better, let's learn something together!

Are you new to town or even just not as well connected as you'd like to be? Sick of scams or getting the run around? Do you like to party? And maybe even get into a little mischief? Well, if that's the case then you and I likely have some common interests...

Im known to be quite helpful, in a number of ways, and I'm always down to make new friends around the Aurora area. Im usually pretty open as far as my schedule goes,I'm upfront and honest, plus you'll never catch me on any of the bs I'm finding out is all over this city. 

Mainly I like to either nod out with the boy, here in Aurora; but sometimes my friend Crystal hits me up and we get to spinning around really fast. Either one of those friends are really good people and very easy to deal with. Occasionally I run into some other folks I know, as well. It just depends on the day.

Anyways, I'm up and about hoping to meet some new friends. If you're interested in anything I wrote here, you're totally welcome to hit me up thru email and tell me more about yourself, along with more about what kind of friend you're looking for and what you're expectations are. The more details you include, the more likely you are to get a fast and complete reply. 

I'm not looking for dates, pic swaps, or any kind of pnp situation. Platonic friends only. Must be down to party!!

Please read the whole ad:

Hi! I just moved to S. Denver a month ago and am wondering if there are any cool, stable and intelligent beings who just enjoy meeting new people? I'm open to anything winter related (skiing, hiking, tubing), going out to movies, road trips, sports, and food. Haha I'm a health nut and love cooking and working out and running so a workout partner is wanted as well. . I'm 420 friendly and always find that to be a good ice breaker seeing as I DONT drink or smoke cigarettes.. I can't host but would be down to meet up somewhere or come to you if you're within a good distance. I'm not looking for romance of any kind. I am in my early twenties, single, no kids or crazy exes and employed. This is a real ad and I'm genuine. Hope you are too. Love watching movies and tv and just smoking a bowl or going for a trail run or a new healthy or super yummy place to eat. 

Someone in their twenties to early thirties is preferred and no one married. Please send some interesting things about you and not just one word or one sentence. :) I'm looking more to hang out than write emails. Again, please tell me about you. I've said a lot about me. And if we are to meet, a face picture would be lovely. I'm not going to keep it and I can send one back. Please don't try otherwise

We not not looking for anything sexual just friendship. We do drink and do not smoke or do drugs. If you smoke no big deal we just ask you step outside if we have game nights. (Vape pens are ok). I would like to have more friends that I can have a girls night with. He would like more guys time. Couple time is also what we are looking for as we don't get much adult interaction, so games nights couples date nights, other activities if have kids as well. We don't care what you look like or if your a couple with kids a couple without kids single or single parents if you can laugh and have fun and you have a good heart. We look forward to hearing from you.

Good morning. Thank you for reading. I'm an educated, career-oriented man who is looking for someone around my age to text with and become friends with. I live elsewhere but have lots of family in the Denver area. I consider myself a workaholic which doesn't leave much time for doing things with friends. That's why I thought I'd try this.

I'm happily married so if you are too or if your single that works. I'm a good listener and sincere in what I set out to do.

Hi everyone!

Ive tried posting here before but I'm open to trying again. I'm outgoing, wild and very crazy. I'm also super loyal, honest, genuine, and real. I'm very open and inclusive. I love to be weird: to dance and sing in public, laugh at jokes that aren't funny, and try new things. I'm pansexual and super open minded. I currently babysit for multiple families and I love taking care of kids. 

I love to go hiking and camping. I'm a big fan of bowling and miniature golf. I read more than anyone I've ever met (anything from romance to fantasy to teen fiction.) I'm a gamer girl and play games frequently. I love all types of music, though when listening to the radio I usually only listen to 106.7 or 98.5 :) My absolute favorite when it comes to music is Indigo Girls. I've been obsessed for years. I haven't bought their new album yet but I definitely want to!! I like watching TV, but there are way too many shows I like to narrow it down for you. I'm always down to try new things and have new experiences. 

I don't do any drugs and I recently quit smoking. I occasionally like going out to bars/clubs but would rather go salsa dancing or bowling.

I've gained a lot of weight lately (health issues) and would love some help/motivation to get out of the house. Ideally I would go for a run/walk/jog in the afternoons/evenings and maybe even do some yoga or martial arts. If I could find someone willing to put in the effort I'm positive we would start seeing results. :) 

I'm hoping to meet people near me who are also wild and crazy. Who don't do drugs, and are open and friendly. Those with sarcastic humor and who live near me a plus. I want someone who wants to do stuff, but is also okay with just coming over and hanging out. I don't always feel like driving to see people and sometimes wish people would come to me. Hope to hear from you!! I'm not trying to sleep with you, so I have no preference on race, height/weight, sexual orientation, gender, age or anything like that. 

Please put ""New Friend"" in the subject line so I can weed out the people who actually read my post, from the scammers. I'm more likely to respond if you tell me about yourself and maybe say why you think we would be good friends. If you include your phone number we can text, since that's much easier for me and I'll respond much faster.

Looking for a person who is interested in having some fun though chatting, somebody to whom I can tell serious stuff or silly things, ask every kind of question and vice versa, not looking for anything but a friend, just somebody who can make me laugh and when the mood hits hold a serious conversation. But I promise there won't be too much of that because it's just not as much fun as being goofy.

We won't meet, probably won't even know what each other looks like. But if you want a picture just let me know and I'll google one for you lol

Have a nice day :)

Hi!

I had another ad up but something happened to it. Anyway, I am looking to make some real friends, hopefully ones that want to hang out with me and do things. I have been in Denver over a year now, and have had zero luck in making friends, and zero luck in romance. I also have no family here, so you can imagine in such a big place it can get pretty lonely.

How does this happen? Sigh, I don't know. A lifetime of moving around with my Father being military, and I was too. Being a little shy and introverted....dozens of factors I guess. But being single, without family, and without friends is not a natural state for a human being to be in! Especially a kind one such as my self. I plan to place this ad in the male section as well eventually, but I do find I tend to get along better with females.

Id like to meet some people my age range 36-45, that keep in shape and want to help me get in shape, like movies, exploring, perhaps some hiking ""as I would like to get into that"" and open to other things. I don't smoke, and I don't hunt animals. Here is a list of some of my interests, I have also attached a photo.

Please no scams, I need to find some connection to Colorado.

Music, Animals, Movies, Volunteering, Biking, Hiking, Exploration, Road trips, Tattoos, Motorcycles, Shooting, Drums, Martial Arts, Flying, Learning, Computers, Games, Red box , Exploring , Mountains, Oceans, Autumn, Sunsets, Meditation, Science, Holding hands, Being in love, Communication, Conversation, Art, Web design, Museums, Dog parks, and much more!

Please be within the age range so we have shared experiences and hopefully things in common, your interests, maybe a photo since I have one, and what part of Denver you live in. Sometimes things go to spam and I miss them, other than that if I don't reply then I felt we probably didn't share a lot in common.

Thanks for reading my long ad.

If you only knew how often you cross my mind, consuming my thoughts. I miss you even though I've never had you. Throughout my life I have been lucky enough to experience love and I have also learnt what it feels like to go without. The dull ache from loneliness courses through my body. The tears have spilt out of my eyes landing on my pillow because sometimes it's too much to take. I know exactly how much I have to give to you. Craving so desperately your gentle embrace, just tight enough that I won't slip away but light enough to give me the room I need to breath. Wanting to drink you in and escape into you. I often sit alone at my table eating the food I've prepared looking at your empty spot, wishing for your companionship. Those easy going conversations and comfortable silences. Have I had you, only for you to slip away? Are you searching for me right now? 
I've looked for you time and time again always coming up short. Where will we find each other? Online? Will we see each other somewhere and recognize a safe place in one another's eyes? Oh my sweet, dear friend, my lover come to me. Let my words awaken you. I wait for you as patiently as I can possibly bear.

I'm looking for something that I've been craving for a long, long time. I'm married and have been in a relationship where there is very little communication and almost no connection or creativity. Those are things that I long for and that are core to who I am as an individual. I'm not looking to change your situation or mine, but I would like to find another married or single woman who is capable of intimacy on all levels, intellectual, emotional, and physical intimacy. We will primarily be focused on the intellectual and emotional, but there is much to be said about someone who is also in touch with their body and knows what it means to connect on a physical level. If you are wired like me and craving the same things, send me a note and tell me more about you...

I'm an Italian man from California where I grew up surrounded by Asian women. Asian women are by far the most beautiful in the world. Living in Colorado they seem to be almost non-existent. I would love to meet someone that is open to building a friendship and it could possibly be more. It's fine with me if you're married or single, young or old, just be Asian and be willing to share a beautiful friendship...talking, getting to know each other, sharing stories, sharing struggles, sharing dreams, laughing together, being playful, and building a beautiful connection. My best friend in California was an Asian woman who was struggling in her marriage to an Asian man and confided in me. It was platonic but wonderful for both of us, so married is ok. I hope you're out there somewhere, send me a note and tell me more about you.

Are you struggling in your relationship or wish you had a better sex life?

I am a professional, divorced, positive-thinking, compassionate and understanding man.
I'm in my 40's and I have experienced the ups & downs of a long-term marriage, the trials & tribulations of divorce, as well as, the joys and stress of raising children. I understand the ""silent home"", ""living like roommates"", ""walking on eggshells"", ""sleeping in separate rooms"", ""feeling unwanted"", etc.

Throughout the years, I have repeatedly been told that I should be a therapist. I believe that I do have a natural ability to listen, understand and provide positive, constructive feedback to those who are struggling. In particular, I have a strong interest in helping people overcome relationship & sexual issues. My life experiences, combined with my genuine and sincere interest in this area, allows me to do so.

I have a sincere interest in helping people who are experiencing relationship & sexual issues. I know that professional therapy is expensive. I know that many are too shy to seek therapy, as well.

I can offer you free, non-judgemental, sincere advice. I can offer you someone to share your concerns about your relationship or sexual issues, in an anonymous way. Please reach out to me, if you need someone that is a good listener and genuinely interested in helping you.

Or
maybe you have done something with
someone

like
a family member, older man, a girl, etc.. or
maybe you were drunk and did something.
Or
played with abnormal objects or even
animals.
Would like to hear your stories and how it
happene.. pics would be even better
Specially if
noone else knowsYou'll be surprised on

Everyone is their own special being. Some of
us
are wilder than others. ;-) ill start with oneof
mine. One day about sunset was driving
with an
ex gf and from previous touching and
groping,
we got hot so were heading to get a room. On
the way there, she went down on me while i
drove. Couldnt wait any longer so i pulled
over
on side of highway went to passenger side,
bend her on the seat and went at it with both
doors open. Was a thrill.. Dont be shy. Hope
to

I'm not looking for anybody to email me for a booty call I'm strictly looking to make new friends and to get a salsa dancing partner. I used to dance a long time ago and stopped for many years and I'm just getting back into it but I need a dance partner. There are always more guys than girls at the club and so it's dumb just standing there waiting for someone to free up so I want someone that I can learn with and be consistent with.

I'm 29 I have a good job and I'm looking to have a good time. If you wanted to hang out outside of dancing and then that would be fine too. 

I'm really really trying to find someone and have not had any luck so if there's anybody out there who wants to either learn how to salsa and has never done it before and wants to try or someone who is pretty good and is looking for someone to go with. 

If you you are interested please respond and put salsa in the subject line and include a picture of yourself

I just thought I'd try this idea out. I know there are gonna be some ""asshole-like"" responses, but I suppose that comes with the territory...

I'm just a simple dude who has had bad luck in my pursuit of a soulmate. I just thought there was perhaps a fella here who has a sister, female cousin, good friend or co-worker he knows of who perhaps has had bad luck of her own, finding a man to make her happy. Think you may be able to perhaps hook us up with eachother?

I know. I know. You don't know me. As I do understand no one knows others on Craigslist, I figured the best I could do is give as thorough a description of myself as possible. 

ME:

40, very handsome(often told-not boastful), Middle-class male. Independent. I'm not rich, but well enough to live alone. I have a car. I love my career. I'm a singer in two bands. 

I'm not a player. I don't do games, whatsoever. I'm very 20th century. I'm simple. I've never been married and I have no children. Definitely Funny. I work full time, I'm in two bands and yet I still have plenty of time to spare for a relationship. 

I just want one. One woman/best friend/2nd half. I'm African American.

I've never cheated(no bullshit). Completely loyal, chivalrous, minimalist. Independent & responsible. I have no roommates. Somewhat introverted. Looking for something that could possibly lead to an aisle to a march down, if you know what I mean. 

What I'd like? 
Just a pretty, simple, loyal & kind, open-minded woman. I's rather a woman who is not a BBW, as I myself work to stay fit/healthy. No baby's father issues would be great too. I have not one racist bone in my anatomy, so ethnic background means nothing to me. I'd prefer a woman with no kids, as is the case with me, but I'm open minded. If she were the somewhat introverted type as well, I'd really like that. 


I understand how you fellas come to Craigslist seeking as well. Maybe you have a relative or something.

I'm 100% sure that if her intentions were honest as mine are, she'll thank you for life for introducing her to me. No a boastful statement. I just know for sure what I need in life and who I am is all. 


It's not a crime to try this route, so what the heck, right?

If you did know of someone, it would me a lot to hear from you. 

There it is. Just thought, once again, I'd give this a try. Maybe there's someone out there sympathetic who has a good heart with good intentions. 

Thanks for reading my post.

Hey Guys,
I am a gay male who has only straight friends and honestly prefer that because there is so much less drama, I would not mind any gay friends just have not found any! I am looking for good friends to grab drink, go to a concert, and hang out with. I am going to the gym these days so someone to go with would be awesome as well. I am a big guy trying to lose weight and working hard toward that for sure. My number is below send me a pic and a fun fact about yourself and lets see where things go. 

About me.... I am a fun loving awesome guy who has a vivid personality. I will flirt and be funny but its just as friends so you have to be okay with that. I won't hide my true self to be friends with anybody. I work full time in retail sales, I have a car and a place to sleep. I don't need someone to treat me like a prince just someone to hang out with honestly. I do enjoy photography and am starting to take pictures again and try and follow my dream that way. I love going to the movies and hanging out at hole in the wall bars having a beer and playing pool. Trying get out of my shell and live life a little fuller then I have before.

I work full time, I enjoy photography and basically all music. I'm not a bar rat and I'm trying to stay away from drinking so some good friends who don't want to get wasted all the time would be ideal!

Me: I'm 27, since I do work full time and try to get to bed at a good time I don't have much time to go out and meet new people so I'm turning to this. I'm gay so if that's an issue please go to the next listing! I'm a fun loving guy with no filter. I flirt and have fun but you need to know that if you can't have fun then there is no point to talking to me. So send me a message, send me a pic please and your first name! Like I said again I do have a job so if I don't get back to you ASAP please give me some time to respond! Looking forward to meeting some awesome new people!

If you are just looking for a happy ending and a free massage, please look elsewhere. I'm looking for guys genuinely interested. Doesn't matter what label you wear, str8, bi, gay. etc. We all need human touch.

Hello and thanks for clicking on my post! 

I'm fairly new to the area and in search for friendship with a like minded lady + or - 10 yrs my age (34). I work out regularly at a local gym early mornings and have an extensive knowledge on nutrition, exercise techniques/ routines. So even if you are wanting to get in better shape or starting out I can help there too! 

I live a healthy lifestyle but not a total health nut, I enjoy a cold drink now and then and a good cheat meal (: life is too short not too, right?! 
I also love the outdoors and can't get enough of this awesome Colorado weather!

I am attached and not looking to change anyone's situation or create drama. This may sound odd but I prefer a woman's friendship compared to a man's anymore. I'm an open book and honest man that loves to talk, so feel free to say hi!

Or are you curious about this spirit of the soul, the vine of life? To be quite honest I have only experienced Aya, one time, but that was enough to confirm that there is and are other dimensions, and other spirits out there, who are here to help us evolve as individuals, and as a society. I experienced it for the first time, and only time in Costa Rica, almost a year ago to this date. I am sitting here listening to a web cast of Joe Rogan and Graham Hancock right this moment,(an amazing talk by the way) hence the inspiration to reach out on this medium to others that might have experienced it. 

My experience was incredible, in so many cosmic ways, I am not going to get into all the juicy details here, but let me say that I felt like I was one with the jungle, and the leaves, and the vines, and animals and spirits, like I never was before or since. I miss that feeling, that connection, and I would like to find someone who is at least open to experiencing this incredible plant spirit together some day...

Me? I am a writer, a published writer who has written two, sci fi, spiritual-fantasy, novels. Ironically most of the content of my novels takes place down in Costa Rica, which is where I spent a year of my life recently. I miss Costa, I miss the rugged invigorating beautify of her jungles, and oceans and rivers and waterfall. I crave a sensual soul, who I could get lost with in the jungle of love, of passion of nature, together with, I dream of her on a daily basis. 

I dream of frolicking naked under tropical waterfalls, or paddling, on a beautiful river, or on a desolate bay, or in the cave behind my very own special waterfall. I dream of sharing this deeper, divine connection with that special someone, every single day of my life, and I have a feeling that someday soon, we will unite. I have written about here extensive in my novels she is my Ying and I am her Yang. I am the strong masculine, alpha, and she is the divine, sensual, goddess, and together we make magic. We balance each other perfectly, much like the balance that can be found on the Sea Saw of life, if we are fortunate enough to find that bliss. I know I deserve it, I crave it... do you?

I am ready to humble myself, to be the man I was always meant to be, to cherish her, and love her, and to reach a deeper level of consciousness then I have ever experienced. I really do believe that together, anything is possible, anything is achievable, I can help you to see things, to experience things you have only ever imagined.... will you help me to see the things I want to see and feel? I hope you will....

First...... if your a pro keep looking. Not interested!!!!

Now, for any real ladies looking to meet for dinner and a drink, here goes. I am looking for a lady to have a nice conversation over dinner. I would love to hear about your job, your kids, your husband........whatever. Just be interesting. 
I am in Colorado every month or so and I do not like to eat alone. I am married, have kids, a fantastic job, a stable mental status and have not been in handcuffs in (ohh so many) years. If your thinking this guy is crazy, I am, but I know it and that's 90% of the problem today. People think they are normal when they are total fruitloops. I can hold a conversation with a CEO or a homeless Vet ( and we should ALL have a conversation and help out our Vets, homeless or not ) and have that conversation really mean something. I am an interesting mix of Italian and just a touch of Polish, but the Italian really shows. 
Faults: Im overweight, bald, and have a hard time seeing the Bad Things in anyone (until they prove they are no good) but my character really outweighs any visual flaws. 
If your still reading this I think you are getting a sense of, perhaps he is not so crazy....... your intuition is working well. 
Ok, so why post here? He's looking for sex. 
Well, here comes the Italian showing!!!! Fugettabout it........ I am not trying to sleep with you, or any other form of naked recreational activity. I am an extremely clean, safe, almost to the point of germ-a-phobe type of guy so the thought of body fluids and disease transmission just....... well enough, Just not interested in sexing you up (or whatever they call it today) 
Want to sit and drink a 20 year old scotch and see how the flavors tease our tongues, now your talking..... flirt with me, tease, sure, I am a big tease myself. Want to laugh, cry or just unwind to a stranger (who is now your new friend) then I think you might have just found something worth putting together a nice email for. 
Next thought going thru your head (lets see if I'm good) This guy must be an Ogre, you know, Shrek looking. Why is he doing this, hideous looking man..... Well I am not hard to look at, but definitely not ""easy on the eyes"" pretty boy material. I am more the Tony Soprano looking type. Italian comes out again..... If you were out with the girls I would not be the first guy you approached in the bar, nor would I be the last. I fall somewhere in the middle. Talk with me and you'll be sorry you wasted those 12 mins of your life talking to Bernard, the ""Hedge Fund Manager"" that was wearing a $2,700 suit but wouldn't know how to put together an IKEA desk, let alone the IKEA bed he was trying desperately to get you into. 
OK, enough of the rant...... here is the plan. Lets discuss dinner, anything but Italian, unless you really, really want it. Send me a recent, real photo of you. Please don't be a Drop Dead Gorgeous Supermodel (all those things about not sexing you up and body fluids all become null and void) Please be a real and caring person. Married, Single, Widowed, Divorced....... I am not here to judge. Just be a nice person. I am here this weekend and back the end of the month also. I have a car, can pick you up, or meet you at the restaurant. (pick the meet me at the restaurant, If you'd get into a car with me after this post without meeting in public..... Im not sure I want to have dinner with you, your crazy) 
I have put some time into this, please do the same. Tell me a bit about yourself, your situation, your likes, dislikes...... I love Purple. Have you ever been arrested, and was it just a misunderstanding? You know, engage me somewhat. Make me feel good about buying you dinner at WaffleHouse. 
I really look forward to hearing from you.

I have plenty of good friends in my life but not too many gay friends. Yeah, its great hanging out with my straight friends but it would be nice to find other guys like myself who have the same interest when it comes to the same sex. No offense but not really looking for feminine guys. I live a pretty discrete life so it just fits. The crowd I hang out with doesn't provide an opportunity to meet other gay guys like myself or that I would ever really hang out with so that's a bit of the dilemma. I am not looking for sex....particularly. Mainly looking for other laid back drama-free masculine gay guys who are fun to hang with....if other things happen then they happen but I am NOT looking to get laid here as top priority.

Hi,

Thanks for taking the time to read my post. For some time now, it's been clear my circle of friends has grown smaller, and those I do have are shifting. I am feeling less connected than many years ago when we began our friendship. Though they are dear to me, I am finding myself longing for a connection with another who values not only intellect, attending to physical body's needs (e.g. exercise, sustenance) but also has a desire to be better than he is today. I am seeking someone who finds gratitude in the smallest of things (e.g. the sunshine, the water, the contributions others have made to his life) and wants to share in that kindling of a new friendship to create new opportunities of gratitude and sharing

A little bit more about me: Single, blk, gay (though you do not have to be), 41. I like intimate coffee talks and smaller venues to get to know others, non-drug user, non-smoker to include 420, rarely drink. I also enjoy reading specifically books on dreams, hiking, exercise, good company, good movies. I find that for me it's not about the activities but the people I share those activities with that determine if I am having a good time.

Who I would like to meet: people with life experiences that have strengthened them but have also provided them with humility, those who know there is more to life than just the daily grind, those looking to connect with quality individuals and have their lives bettered for knowing another human in the world, those who have a great sense of humor but is also kind in their humor, and those who can challenge me to being a better person as I will challenge them out of my commitment to support others in being the best they can.

If interested, please say hello. Until our paths cross, I wish you all the best life has to offer.

To be honest, there are a lot of guys looking for friends that are perfect. And there aren't any perfect guys in the world. I'm not a perfect guy. I'm average. I don't have the perfect body. I'm not fat or skinny. I am actually looking for a guy who isn't perfect. I'd definitely like to find a guy who does not have the perfect body. I'm looking for a fat male friend. We can always work on losing weight together and not feel judged. I enjoy walking, movies, camping, fishing, having a beer or two. Looking for someone around my age. I'm 35- married. 3 kids. looking for a friend between 25-40. I'm not looking for sex. Wouldn't mind finding a text buddy, but I don't mind getting out when I'm not working. I'm not a sport guy, but I like baseball. I also wouldn't mind finding a friend to watch porn with. Nothing sexual. Someone who is honest, laid and wouldn't mind starting a conversation.

I live on the east coast and I'm looking to find someone to chat with while im snowed in. I'm 28, not looking to meet or anything, just simply someone to chat with while the snow falls. We can talk through email or kik. I'm a night owl. Message me and tell me something, anything, ramble a bit if you don't mind. I'm not really looking to interact with people who ""don't get it."" If you have no idea what I'm talking about, that's probably you. 
Just looking for a real life conversation about nothing, not the boring basic questions about each other back and fourth conversation, not the leading up to I love you when I don't even know you conversation, none of that. Just the kind where we talk and find something that interests us both, and we talk about it as the time flies by...and then...we move on with our lives. If you can keep it real and get what I'm saying, message me.

I haven't met you... and I have no idea why you've chosen to read this. Perhaps your story is similar to mine, or maybe it's much different. I'm not sure what I hope will come of this, but it's a wish I'm brave enough to put out there. I know it's possible... I know that there is at least someone out there who has spent a lifetime wanting a sister to know deeply and be known deeply by... to laugh with, share secrets (and everything else) with, go on adventures with... trust and love. I believe that this is all possible because I know that family has nothing to do with blood and everything to do with how we treat one another... as an adult, it is a choice we have that we were not privileged with as children... we get to create our own selves into the people we want to be, and we get to choose for ourselves the people we want close to us, who we will call family. If you had a great family like all of us deserved growing up, perhaps you cannot understand... but then again, you're reading this, so maybe it wasn't as perfect as you hoped. 

I am hoping to find what I should have had... what was taken from me... what I've spent a lifetime wishing for. I'm a really good person, and a fiercely loyal friend. I have a lot of wonderful friends. But so many of them have sisters... and it's always an awkward conversation to have with someone who knows what it's like to have the thing you don't know what it's like to have. I don't want anyone to choose this connection because they feel sorry for me... I want them to choose it because they really want it, too, and it's something they have also wished for and hoped for and maybe never thought was possible. We've been led to believe that there are fences in this life, but there's not. So much is our free choice.

I am just curious as to what is wrong with me. I have days where I am able to stick to a routine and schedule and get a lot of stuff done, and then there are days like today where I can't get myself to leave my bed, let alone my house. It's not really that I feel depressed, I just have zero motivation to get anything done, not even to eat or take care of anything. It also seems to be accompanied by some strong compulsions. I was sober until today, but fell off the wagon of sort due to an almost overwhelming urge that simply didn't exist all last month. It is strange, I guess I have always done this but kinda live in denial about it. Would love your input if you have experience with this sort of thing. Thanks

So...I am looking for somebody who is looking for something, too. More than anything, just something interesting. Specifically, I am looking for somebody over 35, married or attached (because I am and looking to remain so), confident, smart, and funny. 

Me? I am early 40's, smart enough to not run with scissors, dumb enough to laugh at those who do and hurt themselves doing it...tall enough to see the dust bunnies on the top of your refrigerator, but wise enough not to look... I'm healthy enough to enjoy the benefits of gravity such as skiing, mountain biking, rafting...but clumsy enough to have accumulated some stories of my losing some battles with that gravity...active, energetic, creative, laid back, and open. 

Looking for email and/or chat conversations about anything interesting or funny...but only if we are a good fit! To find out, and to see if you are real or a SPAM bot, here is a little quiz (please be prepared to answer each question in your response): 

1. My favorite part of a man's body is __________. 
2. When I see somebody doing something stupid, I ________. 
3. The last time I laughed so hard I cried was _________. 
4. The place in Colorado I would or do most like to visit is _____________________________. 

Drop me a line and be interesting! Let's see where things go.

How about this for a great weekend?

I'm a business man from Washington, DC and I'm traveling through Denver this weekend. Because of the blizzard I'm going to stay an extra couple of days near Denver International Airport. Saturday morning - Monday morning. I don't have any plans but I have a great smile and desire to share!

I'd love to treat you to an all-expense paid weekend/getaway/stacation! Totally my treat. It would be something like this:

- Saturday afternoon / evening. Dinner. Movie? Dessert? Drinks!
- Sunday morning breakfast/brunch then massage at spa
- Sunday dinner and movie or perhaps some other entertainment
- Monday morning breakfast/brunch then I'm headed to airport.

If you're up for it - I'm a fit and white, educated guy. 

No worries... no pressure and I posted in strictly platonic for a reason. I have a girlfriend. I'm not seeking on changing that. But it would be wonderful not to spend the time cooped up all alone.

If you're in the same position and want to hang out and simply have a drama-free getaway with no risk or expense, let's do it!

The perfect ""date"" would be 25-35 and fit and enjoy smiling because we're going to do a lot of that!

I can't really afford the $80 massages all the time so I'd like to find someone that would be willing to do it for around $40 but we would meet consistently (at least once per month). I'd prefer if you were certified but not a requirement as long as you are talented. I am young, fit, and attractive. . . I'd like you to be someone within 10 years of my age and at least height/weight proportionate would be nice. No offense lol I just would feel more comfortable this way but I'm not real picky so don't be afraid if you don't feel you meet those requests.

Lol. . .well excuUUUUuuuse me! This IS the platonic section after all! Don't get mad at me because you can't find someone in the personals section...get back in there! I don't care what you smell!

I have fun just going alone, but it's fun to make a dinner un-date out of it. Un-date...you know...just a casual meet up with no ""omg, what do I wear?"" or ""Is he going to call me?"" expectations. Just an hour of getting to know each other followed by a movie we both really want to see. (You know, as opposed to a date where one of us pretends to like the other's taste). Or we pick a ""film""...watch it, and then discuss the themes over dinner.

Best case scenario: We click as friends and do it again.
Worst case scenario: I slip a roofie in your drink and you wake up the next day wearing a diaper and missing a few fingers. 

KIDDING. . .sheesh. . .when did serial killer jokes stop being funny? :-P

I don't care what you look like as long as you're close to my age, interesting, like to laugh, and SINGLE. I know, this is just platonic, but you'd be amazed at the drama and plans that have to get cancelled when we introduce spouses into the equation. If you wanna swap pics because you ran out of luck on the ""romantic"" side, that's fine, but don't hit me with the ""pic please"" email. Put a LITTLE effort into caring about my personality. :-P 

Movies I'd like to see: Hateful 8, Room, Daddy's Home, Revenant, Spotlight, Big Short

I have met my fair share of CL crazies, but for the most part, I've met a lot of really nice people through here....so here I'm giving it another whirl since there are some movies I want to see. Looking to go Saturday or next week. 

Edit - Apparently ""Strictly Platonic"" means ""I want to date you"" because that's all the responses I'm getting. I REALLY don't care what you look like, and I don't want to pay for you lol...I just want to go see a movie without any strings, or being judged on my pics - geez!

It would be nice to be able to do my own family's pictures eventually instead of paying another photographer to do them.

I am 31, a family man, homeowner, drug free, honest, non judgemental, Air Force Veteran, and open and willing to learn! I do have my own professional career, but only work three weeks on/ three weeks off, so I do have time to invest as well as can travel if need be.

I understand that it will take a while to learn, and then there is editing to learn too. If your looking for a friend with photography as an interest/ hobby, or maybe even an assistant, please feel free to send me an email.

So I find myself in the ""isn't high school over???"" years. my best friend seems to have completely dropped me and I cant figure out why. So I have no adult friends any more (besides my husband), which... sucks.

I'd love to have a friend to come over or take kids to the park or mall, or swimming... or just an adult (NON SEXUAL) relationship. wondering if that's possible at all any more. I don't do facebook; i'm a stay at home mom who's a full time nanny, but weekends are free! i'm pregnant with my second kiddo, my oldest is 3. Gonna be quiting my nanny gig in a few months. I don't mind if you don't have kids yourself, just be fine with mine (he's an outdoorsy little heart breaker :p ). 

fave movies: harry potter.... fantasy, a little scifi, i'm highly amused by big foot shows, comedies... really anything but slasher death and bloody guts movies....
fave things to do: go to parks with my son, dollar stores, thrift stores, working out (i'm by no means crazy fit, but I like jogging and workout dvds), photography...
misc: i'm very much in love and happy with my husband (this is in platonic for a reason ppl...). i'm a Christ follower but not nutts. i'm ok with a little rec pot when my son's not around (and were I not pregnant ;p). I appreciate honesty the most in a friendship. I laugh easily and am pretty laid back. I like tattoos and piercings and would love if my hair would just GROW purple... ha. I have 4 cats... 

just needing some REAL adult interaction. no men.........

I've got an interesting proposition for someone who's open minded. I am currently in a relationship, and while I'm very happy in it, I can't stop thinking about other girls.

I was hoping to find an extra special female, who would love to hang out, do fun things, share some forms of intimacy (cuddling, flirting, etc) but without all the sexual aspects.

I don't condone cheating, but really yearn for another person to become close with (without it being considered cheating).

Is this post most likely going to be ignored? Probably. But maybe there is someone in a similar situation that might find this to be interesting.

First of all let me start by saying I struggled with where to post this question. It is sexual in nature however I am NOT looking to hook up, so it could be in casual encounters. But since my intentions are not to hook up it could be strictly platonic. With that being said my question may come across as being unclassy but here it goes.

I woke up this morning feeling extremely horny and have been thinking nasty thoughts all day which is less than ideal considering I am at work. As I have been driving around I have been on occasion rubbing myself through my jeans. My question is probably obvious, but I will ask it anyways. Do women ever rub themselves while they are driving? Thinking about that in my head has only made my condition worse so I thought I would just ask. I probably will get flagged but what the heck, it was worth a shot. I look foward to some interesting responses and hope that i don't come across as a perv. Or a creep

Hello there to all my true fellow vegans (and all those interested) in veganism! I am a proud kid free vegan who made this compassionate and easier than I thought it would be switch this past summer (to all the awesome plant based foods and products out there in stores and online) looking for like minded people to be friends or roommates with who share this passion. It doesn't matter what sex, gender, color, ethnicity, height, religion, etc you are. (Unless you are a single handsome man who is vegan and likes to have sex, lol.) I am spiritual but not religious. LGBT are awesome people too! I don't discriminate about that stuff because I understand what it's like to be different or unique, discriminated against, and think outside the box. Being vegan is still rare/ in the minority but with my combined concern of animals and other causes I care about is what made perfect sense to make the change. The state that the world is in (animal treatment especially) will always be depressing unless it changes. How about you, what is your story? I am still learning and trying new products so if anyone has suggestions on what else to try I would love to know about it. I am a true animal person and willing to travel to meet. Which brings up my next question: Are any real vegans out there interested in opening up an animal sanctuary and/or growing organic plant based foods? I volunteer at animal sanctuaries already and would love to have a place to rescue animals someday (I'm currently unemployed) so if you have any ideas of how to go about this or interested in being a fellow vegan friend of mine great. Thanks for reading and ahimsa!

Hi there, I'm David. I'm a 29 yr old male born and raised in Colorado. First, a little about what I'm looking for....

I'm basically just interested in meeting new people in various ways. Everything from friends to hang out with, people to do arts with, a woman to love, or even a couple to become close with. I'm very open minded and am interested in getting out and experiencing new parts of life. I would love to find someone to personally connect with, but am also open to NSA fun with someone if it were to happen that way.

Now for a little about myself...

I am a very open, honest, and positive person. I enjoy many aspects of life, but really have a passion for arts. Especially photography and music. I enjoy the outdoors, and try to get out as much as possible! I love to hike and backpack or anything that gets me into nature. I am not really religious, but am very spiritual. I have a 5 year old son that lives with his mother that I adore dearly and see around twice a week. 

I work currently as a Real Time Analyst at a call center. In short, I basically make sure other people are working. :-P I'd like to get into the photography and music full time soon, and have been working on making that happen. I'd like to work for myself and not someone else! :-)

I was hurt really bad in my last relationship. She was older than me, and I thought that may work out as I was looking to settle down. She ended up leaving me for her boss's boss that was more successful and made more money. Obviously, you could imagine how that breaks one's heart!!

Well I hope this was enough information to give you an idea of who I am. Feel free to contact me for any reason you may choose. Keep in mind, I will be very blunt and honest. I'm sure I'll get tons of weirdos and spam from this, so I will be pretty critical weeding out the reals and fakes. ;-)

I have never realized how important it is to have great male friends. If we become friends and hit it off that is great. I honestly don't care if you're in a relationship or not, because my intentions are friendship and friendship only. But if you are single... If we become something more within time, cool. 

I have two guy friends but they are both in college and out of town. It is hard to get ahold of them, Skype or FaceTime them frequently. When I do catch them, they are busy or on the go. So I figured why not find another guy friend that could possibly be like them, but better. I tried to find guy friends at bars or hangout spots but guys are idiots at those places and just looking for some ass. If I was a guy, I would probably too... I love life. I love to laugh. I love to go out. I am a positive soul, positive spirit and positive energy. I adore animals, I love sports, hell I will give you advice on woman (we are complicated as hell). If you're single, we can cry together sometime when we are sad or just have tons of wine and play WII or something... I honestly don't remember the last time, I had so much fun... Girls are all about appearance and blah blah. That isn't me. Although, it is important... I want to have fun damn it. But anyway if this was somewhat appealing email me!

Fellow Denver Bronco Fans!!!!!!

Go Broncos! We brought those ugly, arrogant Steeler fans to their knees, and today I am savoring our victory and looking forward to doing the same to the Patriots next week!

Now for the fun part: I won a bet with my die-hard Steeler-fan boyfriend (I am a transplanted female Bronco fan living in Pittsburgh), and as ""payment"" for the bet, he had to post the message below to the Denver Craigslist website, and will have to read any responses received to me (I would have had to do the same thing here if we had lost - and the best part is, it was HIS idea!!!!).

Here is what he wrote, which I approved:

--

Hello Denver Bronco fans

I am posting this to pay off a bet that I lost to my girlfriend over the Steeler-Bronco game yesterday. Our mutual agreement was that the loser would post this on the winning team's Craiglist site and read any responses received aloud to the winner.

I am a die-hard, life-long Steeler fan, and as such, love to talk trash on any of our opponents (especially Cincinnati, Baltimore, New England, and Denver). My girlfriend is originally from Denver, and ""becomes nauseated"" at my, and the entire city's devotion to the Steelers. Of course, I had no doubt that the Steelers would win yesterday, and for most of the game I taunted her about having to post and read all of the responses to me. I couldn't wait to see her annoyance and humiliation at being personally taunted by Steeler Nation. After that last fumble, my heart sank, and you can imagine the glee in her voice as I was now on the receiving end of her triumphant, taunting tirade.

My ""punishment"" is to expose myself to you as a Steeler fan, and humbly profess my homage and adoration of the dominant Denver Broncos and thier fans. You have undeniably demonstrated to me that you are the superior team, and I barely deserve to be on my knees at your feet. We are asking that you take this opportunity to remind me of how pitiful my allegience is, and let you know that your response will make a lifelong Bronco fan enjoy and prolong the agony of a lowly Steeler fan such as myself.

I am to tell you that I look forward to reading your responses to my girlfriend.

Humiliated Steeler Fan

--

I dreaded having to post a similar message to Pittsburgh fans, of which he constantly reminded me during the game, but when we pulled off our victory, he was almost in tears. I ask that you please respond and let us know what you would say to him, no matter how degrading it is, the more the better! He WILL read every word aloud to me, and I am hoping to make it last for hours.

Thanks!!!

My name is Chris, and I would like to find a nice lady to be my friend.

Some of my interests include watching movies, having interesting conversation, and sharing good food.
I also like to take walks in the park, enjoying live music, visiting museums, and trying new things.
I love to learn from other people's experiences and wisdom.
I am a native of Denver, and would like to share my knowledge and experience, too.

I can offer respectful friendship, someone to talk with, and someone to share fun times with.
Let's meet for lunch or coffee, and get to know each other.

Peace and Love to all,
Chris

Greetings and salutations!

Hope this day finds you well, friend! Well, I was wondering if you'd like to spend some free time talking about this and that, getting to know each other, swapping stories and some laughs? Honestly, I'm kind of feeling down lately, and could use a good hearted soul to pick me up throuout the day (I'll be glad to reciprocate!). Unlike the rest of the ""strictly plutonic"" guys out here, I have no intention of our conversations moving towards anything other than conversation between friends. If it moves past that, we'll cross that road when we get there. Until then, a modern day pen pal is all I'm looking for.

Well, I'm 33 years old, white recently divorced single daddy. I love backpacking, camping, fishing, early American history, gym time etcetera. I think I'm a good natured person with a funny bone second to none... and kind of a closet dork. Bearded with tattoos. I have no qualms about my new email or texting buddy, weight, shape, race are all irrelevant in my mind. Just have a warm and kind personality and we'll get along just fine;)

In any case hope this day brings you peace, comfort and tranquility!

I am a 30 year old female, single, no kids and I work full time, Monday through Friday. I tend to be an introvert, however, I enjoy one-on-one conversations and am not shy. My idea of fun is to go to the movies, out for happy hour or even to stay in for an evening at home with a good bottle of wine and pizza. One of my other goals is to frequent the gym more often, however, I am not looking for a workout partner per se. Unfortunately, nor do I ski or snowboard or any of the other Colorado-y things that most people enjoy doing. My roots are in the southeast and I plan to relocate back that way at some point, however, I would still love to make new friends to enjoy the remaining time I have in the state.

I love to read....basically everything except sci-fi. I'm all about Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia but that is basically the extent of my interest in fantasy. My taste in movies and TV shows varies wildly from old TV shows like ""I Love Lucy"" to the modern like ""The Middle"". One of my favorite movies I saw recently was ""In the Heart of the Sea"" (despite the fact that I did manage to slog through ""Moby Dick"" and it was so boring). 

As I said previously, I do am not dating/engaged/married/have children. I am totally fine meeting up with ladies who are, however, I would prefer to meet someone who actually has available time to hang out and get to know each other. I do not smoke (cigarettes or otherwise due to my job), however, I don't mind if you do providing it is not excessive (I have known women who could not watch a full movie without stepping outside to light up. That is what I mean by excessive). I also would prefer it if you live in the Aurora/Centennial area unless you are partial to driving. It can get challenging to meet often due to traffic and commute times if we're both living on opposite sides of town.

If you think we might get along and you're looking to connect with a new friend in 2016, send an email my way!

Thanks for reading :)

Hi!

I'm 29, m, happily partnered and have been involved with growing cannabis since I was 17. I have had the good fortune of trying cannabis and concentrate from lebanon, morocco, afghani, african (durban, swaziland, not the strains but actual flowers from these places) nepal, belize, mexico, aruba, curacao and a few other places I'm forgetting, oh yeah, Jamaican!! lol

Anyway, the point is, I am very well versed in LANDRACE genetics and am looking to network with people in LEGAL JURISDICTIONS to help support the preservation and propagation of these special genetics, which once lost to hybridization, exctinction, legal controls, etc CAN NEVER, EVER, EVER (seriously) be gotten back. You can NEVER beat what took thousands or millions of years to produce, all you can do is combine and recombine what IS ALREADY THERE. That means breeders only get to take credit for stabilizing hybrids, the magic COMES FROM THE LANDRACE untainted genetic pool. :) It's kinda a big deal.

I'm interested in ANY sort of collaboration. I'm a competent grower, preferring outdoors but capable indoors as well. I'm chemical-free entirely but that's not a pre-requisite for collaborations, just my preference (because why on earth would you taint rare genetics with synthetics salts, and X-icides, and all the heavy metals and carcinogens that go along with them?!?!). 

I'm open to assisting a grow or grows, acting as a seed repository where I will be happy to store seeds under ideal storage conditions (moisture, temp, light, air control), or whatever I can do to facilitate the protection of one of this planets greatest assets: It's heirloom cannabis genetic pool <3

I like healthy, voluntary relationships with people, who are respectful and easy going. I don't get along well with people who are unhappy, unfriendly, unkind, disloyal or egotistical. I like good energy and I avoid negative energy like the plague unless I see an opportunity to transmute that energy in to something pleasant or healing.

I used to be very spiritually, emotionally and physically unhealthy. Then I found cannabis, raw and traditional foods, and hermetics (ancient knowledge of quantum physics) and it flipped my life and perspective upright :) Now I just want to help others heal in all the areas I was (I say was, but there is a lot of remediation and healing to do in my spirit yet, this society is pathological by it's (unsustainably) consumptive nature) pathologically trapped with western brainwashing (skinner box, prussian (original nazi) schooling system, etc)

We have a chance now for a beautiful, free world, where we can do what we like as long as it doesn't harm others, let's help eachother make it happen!

PS: It shouldn't matter but I'm happily partnered with an amazing artist/model extrordinaire, we are in a poly relationship that is open to other dynamics and we work together to help eachother become successful in our respective fields of passionate labor. :) Thanks for reading, please email with greetings, encouragment, leads or just saying high! ;)

As life goes on and I look around its amazing what's happening in this country , in the world in general . It makes me question what's really going on , where is this leading and who is really calling the shots . Wars without end , fewer decent jobs , a cost of living that is crushing many people . A government that seems out of touch and more controlling all the time . Just wondering if there's a lady in the same age group that's been watching all these changes over the years that feels like shooting the bull . Online or over coffee , doesn't matter .

I have an unusual proposal.
I'm a single middle age male. I recently was hired on with a great company in Boulder Colorado. I currently live in Colorado Springs. I would like to find a female who would be willing to develop a friendship/roommate type of relationship. Doesn't require sex. I would be able to pay rent and utilities in exchange for a room and transportation to and from work. I can pay up to $300/week every Friday. I can also offer any repair work needed, free of cost. I will also contribute to cooking, cleaning, and any other chores. I'm looking for a fairly quiet, clean area near Boulder Colorado. If this appeals to anyone, please don't hesitate as I'm ready for the move and would only be bringing along my necessities.

How do you like living in CO as a women? I'm an AA woman and would like the opinion of other ethnic women. Its a big move and kind of scary. So my fears are excessive racism and the ability to find work, interracial dating ( I date mostly white males) and scary areas. I've been to CO on vacation and loved it also looking at Oregon. What areas are nice and not so nice? Any input would help. I'm also an artist and love house music. How are the EDM clubs there?

Hi =] My name is Danielle (26) and my husband (29) and I own a home in Aurora. I am a stay at home mom of my 8 month old daughter and looking for people to hang out with that have little ones themselves or don't mind me not really being able to get away alone. I'm pretty relaxed. I like to hang out at the house and bbq, play pool, movies, shopping (which I mostly mean walk around target for hours and end up buying the most random things I don't even need). Just because I am a stay at home mom does not mean I make my own baby food, cloth diaper, or baby wear 24/7. I get a lot of moms who want to hang out and then judge everything I do, so if that's you, don't even bother. I love road trips and seeing new places. I travel to California around 5 times a year and this spring i'm planning a long touristy road trip to Georgia =] I don't mind just being texting buddies either, I know how hard it is to get out of the house with little ones, esp in this cold weather. I don't mind wine/beer drinking/cigarettes but we are not drug friendly including pot.

I am deserving of love. 
I deserve to be proud of my body and proud of my individuality and I should love myself too. 
I am More than my genitals. 
I am More than my breats. 
I am not an object, not a fasination, not a prize, and not a demon or Satan's child. I AM HUMAN JUST LIKE YOU. 

Your dick does not FORCE you go wear a blazer instead of a dress. YOU ARE CHOOSING THIS. and if that choice feels safe and pleasant with you soul that is awesome! 
My choice safed my life. My choice to love myself despite my brain not matching my body was an act of self love over self loathing. I feel safe and content within my mind when I embrace ALL OF ME. my femininity and masculinity. 

Be proud. Be queer. Be gay. Be non binary. 
Believe in yourself. 
Love yourself. 
Take care of yourself because no One else will. 
Be your own best friend Because everyone deserves a pep talk at their lowest and a high five at their best. Pat yourself on the back for being true to yourself.

I'm looking for someone (male or female, as long as we're roughly on the same fitness level) to help me establish some accountability and come workout with me. It will be fun, I swear. 

I have a 24 Hour Sport membership, and I work full time from 8-6 in Golden, and live downtown. 

Let me know if that sounds good!

Hey ladies. My name is Tyler I'm a 21 y/o sane white male. I'm not looking for fwb or quick sex, I'm looking for a genuine real respectable woman to get to know.

I'm a 35 professional male. I spend at least every third weekend alone with my 1 year old boy. I'm looking for people in the area who would be interested in hanging out with me and my son on the weekend. You can have a kid but not a requirement. If you do would be good if they were close in age.

Things I like :
Read
Listen to Music
Play Music (Piano/woodwinds/guitar)
Hiking/Walks/Outdoors
Exploring Colorado
Running/Lifting
Yoga/Spirituality
Dance
Gaming (video/board/card games)

I would love to find someone in the local are who would be available to hang out every so often as our lives allow. I dig open minded people who like to learn and experience new things. I work and have a pretty stable situation so if that's you also, that would be great. I do science for a living so if you are into learning about that I can teach you. I'm not looking for a relationship but someone who is fun and flirty is cool too. Age really doesn't matter but we definitely need to be on the same wavelength.

If any of this sounds good to you send me an email and lets chat.

As we stared across the room at each other, we knew we were meant to be friends. Even though we both knew we had rings on our fingers, it was risky to be seen together, but the risk was worth the reward. The reward of having a great friendship. Who knew a lady with heals likes to exchange those heals for a set of hiking boots and hit the trails. After a great hike, we stop at the local hot springs, you look stunning as we sit side by side in the hot water, snow all around. To laugh and have fun, perhaps stop and have a drink after a fun day together. 
I know it's all imaginary, but this or something like it could happen. 
Please don't judge me, I don't judge anyone for there position, we might be in the same boat after all!!
Maybe put a different twist to the story as well!

So we're hitting the gym and we've come to the conclusion that we need gym friends to keep us motivated were both in our 30's not fat but wanting to look better. We're not looking for sex but we could all go grab a drink or do couple dates but mainly looking for gym friends. Would prefer you be close to our age.

Hello!

For the past couple of years I have been traveling extensively for work so it has been difficult to meet new people and form friendships. My job obligations no longer require me to be on the road nearly as often so I would really like to make a new best friend or two in 2016! A little about me...

-Late twenties
-Live in Douglas County
-Happy, optimistic, and light-hearted demeanor
-Love traveling the world - been to 5 continents so far!
-Enjoy hiking, playing tennis, mountain biking (beginner), and water sports
-DINK (Dual Income, No Kids) but an animal lover
-Social drinker although not into smoking or drugs
-Favorite TV shows are Big Bang Theory, Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, AHS, Game of Thrones, Vikings, and Jessica Jones. 

You...
-Are not into smoking or drugs
-No children (I have some wonderful friends who are parents but it's very difficult to be spontaneous with them.)
-20s or 30s
-Looking for a platonic friendship only
-Positive personality

If you think we'd become great friends, please send a reply with a little bit about yourself and a picture if you would like. Looking forward to meeting you!

Did you know

Massage improves your rebound time after a training session......FACT
Massage affects specific genes in the muscle cells.......FACT
The first gene reduces inflammation, the second gene turns up the production of mitochondria. What is mitochondria you ask? Mitochondria is the biochemical processes of respiration and energy.

As muscle cells become adapted to endurance exercise, the number of mitochondria increases. Massage helps this process along. 

Massage = FASTER muscle recovery.........FACT

Contact me to schedule a massage AFTER your next workout. I'm fit/young and can definitely help your muscle recovery.

Hi, my name is Holly. I am looking for a friend. 

I'm into Harry Potter and comic books. I love food (I am gluten free). I like to shop, go out to eat, walk around downtown, people watch, read comic books, go to the museum (dinosaur bones are awesome) or just hang out and watch TV shows. I don't drink or smoke weed but it doesn't bother me if you do. 

I am pretty open minded but I don't like the crowded club scene. 

I am married with no kids or pets, except for my pet rock. I am just looking for a friend. Nothing romantic or sexual. 

Email me if you are interested!

Many people have a deep seated fear of appearing nude in a public setting. In fact for many, it has been observed that only the fear of public speaking rivals public nudity for the power to induce sheer terror in the hearts of many of us. Still being nude in public holds a certain degree of appeal for many of us causing it to be an experience that some secretly long to try. If you've ever given thought to trying social nudity but feel that you are just too nervous to try it, allow me to offer some suggestions that might enable you to overcome your fear and embrace the joys of going au naturel.

Fear of public nudity is quite common and natural given that most of us have been socialized since childhood to feel that exposing our bodies in mixed company is wrong or even sinful. Coupling that with that the common fear of the unknown that most human beings have, one can quite readily understand why someone wouldn't be immediately comfortable with the idea of going nude in a communal setting. Phobias are usually best overcome by taking small steps. As a child you first learned to crawl, then to stand, then to take a few wobbly steps and much later you finally learned to run. This is a good method to employ in any endeavor that you feel is challenging and just a bit scary. Take your time and progress by taking small steps.

I can feel you.

The guilt you feel for ""letting"" your body go.
But what if you didn't let your body go?
First of all, I'd like to invite you to let go of any guilt you have about this.
Because your body is doing something for you.
We just need to see if we can figure that out.
I am not your typical trainer, meaning this wouldn't be just about the food you eat, or the exercise you do or don't do, but how you think and feel about yourself.
I don't work in quick fixes, but in helping people shift their lifestyles.
Giving them the tools to do so for the rest of their lives.
If you are interested in heading down that road, I offer a complementary consult/ workout to see if we can work together.
Let me know if you are ready for that.

I lost my best friend, my dog about a year and half ago, and at that time, I knew times were going to be lonely and hard, but I didn't think those times would last this long. In the past few years, past several years actually I have had a series of bad luck, bad women, lying women, cheating women, scamming women, dishonest business associates, people who lied to me in so many ways... Most recently, a week ago actually, I went out on a date who I met on here. We had a nice dinner together, a hot make out session in my jeep afterwards, she told me I was a great kisser... and what happens?

She stood me up for the date we had the next afternoon, no texts, no call, no nothing....And so... Here I am alone in my place, in my life, wondering what I have done to deserve this? Seriously, I have wronged no one, in a very, very, very long time... I have not cheated, I have not lied, I always try and put peoples happiness in front of mine, and what happens? Nothing good, thats for sure... 

The only thing that is keeping me grounded and hopeful right now is a business venture, something I have been working on for over 15 years in one way or another. Maybe this will finally be the big break I have been hoping and praying for, for all these years... If it does not pan out in the next 2-3 months... I think I will just figure out a way to get out of this dark, cruel, evil world....Why am I writing this now, on here? I don't really know... Maybe there is a single, attractive woman out there who has had a similar streak of luck? Maybe there is someone out there who can identify... I don't know... I know I don't have much faith in the human race these days, that much I do know...

I used to drink myself out of these lonely feelings, but I quit doing that, as I realized that is no solution... So I am here, alert, not really tired, surely sober, and wondering to myself... what is the solution...I think to myself that I am either cursed, or I am to picky for my own good,... maybe I should lower my standards, I live a healthy life, I work out, I have a pretty tight body, and a very vivid imagination, a very artistic, mystical, compassionate mind....

Sometimes I think maybe I should not look for a woman who is in shape, who is exceptional in any way shape or form. Maybe I should date a ""plane jane""... but the reality is... I can't...

Well... Welcome to the novel I'm writing here on Craigslist! I know it's not the norm here to write such descriptive ads, but after looking through the ads, I've come to realize that all of the ads here are either pictures of someone's junk, or are severely lacking in what a person is looking for. 

To begin, I'm only here because I, like most here are lonely in life. Over the years I've seen my close friends find significant others, get married and sometimes have kids. I, on the other hand have chosen to focus on my career, become financially stable, advance professionally, gain respect among my peers, and plan for the future. Yes, I may have a 401k and a paid-off house, but it all came at a cost emotionally. 

The past decade has seen me travel to many different countries, experience different cultures and learn lots about myself as an individual. My friendship circle has barely reached beyond those that I met before this ""journey of myself"" through work, and is now dwindling to only those I can count on one hand. Anyone I have dated or fallen in love with over the past decade has either ended up, (most of the time unbeknownst to me) committed to someone else, or has been discovered to be leading me on in one way or another.

Along with being hurt relationship-wise, I have also had to deal with previous emotional trauma that makes it difficult for me to venture out. This doesn't mean I'm against meeting new people, nor am I fearful of it, but I am a little bit more cautious when it comes to trusting anyone. I've conquered my anxiety issues, but a bit of PTSD still exists from prior experiences. This does not mean I will flake at random times, as my integrity means I will follow through to anything I commit to.

Sad story aside, I don't seek pity, nor do I seek acceptance for my mental flaws -They are my cross to carry, and I'm dealing well. These issues are all part of the journey of life, and without them, it (and I) would be damn boring. All I'm seeking is someone to get to know, get to trust and experience life together with. 

If you aren't deterred by the sob story above, I'm happy you are still reading. 

If I were asked to describe myself, I'd say I'm unique (like everyone else...ha). I was raised a country boy, small town, genuine and a ""call it like I see it"" personality. I can't stand drama, I love giving shit to others, and I can receive it back like a champ. My idea of fun is a weekend fishing or hunting with like-minded individuals, or a weekend of exploring the wilderness in a 4x4 or 4-wheeler. I ride a motorcycle, have a truck and know how to gut a buck in near darkness (haha). 

To be honest, I'm a bi dude who leans towards dudes, but this ad isn't about sex. I'm an open book, and I'm honest about who I am. I'm here for a friendship, but if something beyond that happens, I'm game. I've had both girlfriends and boyfriends, and I loved all of them the same. All of my girlfriends broke my heart more than my boyfriends, so that may explain my leanings. That aside, If you tell me you're straight, bi, lesbian, asexual, gay, etc. I respect what you tell me. Since I'm a face-value type of guy, I don't make any moves past friendship, nor do I break up existing relationships. My straight and gay friends know about me, and trust me to not push - as do their significant others. I value friends over prospective ""flings."" -references are available upon request to back up that claim. Ha. 

So, with that mentioned, if you're a guy, I'm loyal as fuck and will back you up with my steel-toed shit kickers anytime you are crossed, and I'll never suggest anything outside of boundaries you establish. If you're a girl, I'll be that guy who will be there to talk, converse with and support you in every way a friend could -without me suggesting physical anything unless YOU suggest otherwise. If you're asexual, same above and I won't question the way you are made, and enjoy the interaction. If you're in a committed relationship, I'll be the best buddy I can be to support both you and your significant other, since you'd be a package deal in my mind.

Quite simply, I'm an educated, bearded grizzly-Adams type guy who is lookin for great people to share experiences with. I may live in the city, but I'm far from it. I'd love to find other like-minded people to start a friendship with. I can't be the only country guy (or gal) forced to move to the city who meshes. 

Yeah, I'm long winded, but at least I'm honest. What am I looking for? Someone to enjoy life with. Movies, eating out, hiking, fishing, hunting, off-roading, cars/trucks, music, political debate, cartoons (lol), etc... These are all things I'd love to experience with someone other than myself. 

If you're into a steel-toe wearing, blue-collar pickup truck driving type of guy, I may be what you're looking for. I have vices like anyone else, so get off your high horse. I drink, I chew and I socially smoke...I'm more than my vices though. And yeah, I gots baggage, but who the hell doesn't? 

If you're interested in a friendship or more, I'm amazed as fuck, so definitely send me a message. Tell me something interesting about yourself, and maybe we can meet up for a beer or good bourbon. I'll guarantee I won't have any pretenses past a good conversation and feeling out our personalities out for a match. Nothing to lose? As for you, I typically gravitate towards those around my age and younger, but if you're ""young at heart,"" I'm all for seeing what we have in common. 

Send more than one sentence. I want to know about you! Have a great day/night/etc!

Young, professional, sexy female looking to rent a room in a house/apartment where smoking indoors isn't a big deal. I've been searching for the right place for almost two months and can't quite find what I'm looking for. 
I'll be starting my new job this month but where I choose to live determines what location my job will place me at, kind of a catch 22 lol...Which means I'm looking to move ASAP!

I'm a Sagittarius professional artist from Northern Colorado, moved to Denver after my first year of college and I love living in the city. I enjoy being social and active, I'm hoping to find roomies that won't mind my friends coming over for a nightcap or a smoke sesh. I am a dancer (not a stripper) so I'm always playing music and hopping around. I love to cook, especially recipes I've never tried, so if you like to eat...you can always join me for midnight munchies or a multi-course dinner. As far as dishes go, I'm not looking for a neat freak roomie...I'll do the dishes within a day or two of making the mess, I'm definitely one to enjoy my meal and not run to clean afterwards. Everything else...I'm on top of it! 
About you:
Just looking for a chill roommate...no drama, no heavy drugs, please be friendly and respectful. A nice person to hang with after a long day or just wave to in passing...I know you're out there! 
Looking to move ASAP...month to month preferred. 420/cigarette friendly indoors would be ideal. Dogs ok, I'm allergic to cats, no pets of my own.

Hey guys
I'm looking first and foremost for people to get to know. To learn about. To talk to. 

Some of my favorite things on the planet are music, video games, football, and my friends. I work 50-60 hours a week, so I want my time off to be as much fun as possible. 
I'm primarily an rpg gamer but do branch out a bit when the mood strikes. 
I'm a diehard Broncos fan, but appreciate a good game regardless of the teams playing. 
My music style is as complicated as it is diverse. I listen to a bit of everything, though I'm currently in a ""phase"" that includes funkstep, electronica, and alternative rock. I'm unpredictable musically. 
Anyway, enough about me!
I'm not real picky about who replies - limiting my audience would automatically reduce my chances of reaching the person I'm here to meet! If you want to talk and see if we get along, send me a message. Put your favorite passtime in the subject line. You can also reach me on kik at sonic_bloom

Look forward to hearing from you!

Hi my name is Adam. Since this is a CL personal's ad, let me first be clear on one point: I am NOT on here looking for sex. Not now, not down the road once you know me better. If that's what you think friendship is, well there are (and unfortunately from my viewpoint) a lot of posts from people who agree with you. Try them.

Now that that is out of the way, let me tell you a little of who I am and why I AM posting on here. It will be the first time I've done so. I'm posting on here because I believe the world we live in makes deep and intimate human connection difficult and therefore hard to come by, at least for me. Honestly, I don't know how to build a real friendship when for many people, the occasional ""like"" on Facebook or ""LOL"" text message constitutes friendship. That and all the rules that forbid men from getting close to one another physically, emotionally, spiritually, or any other _ally unless they are into homosexuality. Sorry, but I reject both the notions of superficial non-connected friendships as well as the opposite that ""real men"" only interact in fist bumps and bro-hugs and don't actually have any kind of feelings or need for anyone but themselves unless for sex.

What I wish I had right now was a friend, about my age, who feels as deeply about things (and other people) as I do. Who isn't afraid to show it. Who isn't afraid to talk to about hard things, but whom I can also go out and do things with, be real with, have fun with, and feel like said friend desires and values me as a friend as much as I value him. I'll be honest, there are some hard things in my life, some that I haven't completely figured out yet. I wouldn't be on here posting that I need friends if that were not the case. But as I said, I also would love to have another man to just do things with. I like racquetball, ping pong, camping, hiking, volleyball, disc golf. I love conversation, and I don't avoid the difficult topics. But I find that I sit around entirely too much since I haven't found anyone to do any of that with. A little help on that front would be appreciated.

I should also say that I have deep convictions about a lot of things, religious, moral, political to name a few, and am not afraid to discuss those topics, as long as it stays respectful. But those convictions also are a way of life for me. I try my best to actually live according to my beliefs, though I often fail at it. On that note, I don't drink or smoke anything so meeting up for a drink or 420 isn't my thing.

If you likewise want such a friend, I may be your man. Just so you have a little more idea of who I am, I'm 29, from South Carolina, but live in Centennial now (near at least some places in Aurora). I am looking for friends around my age (say 20s to about 35 maybe). Not that I mind older people, I just feel I need a peer more than a mentor. I travel a lot for work, which sadly means I'm sometimes gone for a few days at a time, hence at least part of the hard time finding steady friendships in my life.

I probably am one of the more unusual men you'll ever meet. I guess a man who looks for other men in CL ads for anything other than sex is already a little weird, but hey, you're looking in the platonic section too, so let's be weird together. If you'd like to talk more or meet up, feel free to email back. We can start there.

Hey,

Pretty new to Colorado and my work consumes me! I'm not looking for a fwb, nsa, blah-blah-blah thing here. I've recently realized that while I love to do all kinds of adventurous stuff (oh, and I happen to be excellent at planning them) I don't seem to care for doing things alone. Not sure why. Maybe I need someone to laugh at my crummy jokes or just someone to ""bear witness"" to the crazy situations I always seem to find myself in. Anyways, who doesn't like to wake up and just hit the road, off in an unknown direction, stopping and exploring whatever you see on the way & ""playing it by ear""! My closest friends have always been female and so i'm gonna stick with that as I post this on CL. I like to drink, smoke weed, and have a quick-witted-Daniel-Tosh sort of sense of humor. I consider myself pretty laid back and i'm open to everyone. Just don't be a dick. That's my motto, that and everybody wang-chung tonight. 

OH! And if you like stories, I got stories. Most people think i'm a massive liar when I lay out my past for them! I'm not, just very lucky to have had an amazing life so far!!

Hi lonely people, I'm pretty lonely myself. Please don't get me wrong, I have friends, great friends actually, they're just all men. I would like female friends up here in Colorado. 

I'm not your local Colorado mountain man, I'm from Arkansas and where I come from, there was jack shit to do. I enjoy sci-fi, video games, comics (I don't care about the marvel/DC battle), learning about random stuff, and just working on myself. I think I'm fun, just don't really know how to make friends of the opposite sex that can respect that I don't just want to fuck them. I'm not in a place to be in a relationship and I don't know about casual sex, that depends on the person. 

I'm also not an overweight basement dweller that lives with his parents. :p

So, the bad. I have a panic disorder and go to intensive therapy. It's sometimes difficult for me to bounce out and go exploring. Until I figure this out, I don't want to fall in love. I mean, yes, I do. I just can't financially support very much and will not let another potential partner just take care of me, that's not fair and I have ended relationships because I wasn't getting better. They deserved better. :/ It fucking sucks.

Now that the bad is out of the way, I think that I'm a sweet, supporting, positive person. I'm pretty sure that I'm funny and generally a great person, I write this because my friends are amazing and have never let me down and I do my best not to be a shit friend. 

I just read what I wrote, it sounds like an application, not very much emotion, sorry about that, it's hard to write with fiery passion. 

Anyways, wanna talk about anime, animals, space, aliens, music, metaphysical science, spooky ghosts, scary movies, video games, or just bullshit? Browse reddit or 9gag and share our amazing findings? If you have the dankest memes, please share. Hang out and binge watch something on Netflix? Get some crayons and coloring books and listen to each other's music? I'm down. 

Please don't murder me, I doubt it would be pleasant. I will haunt you for forever and be totally mean. Favorite mug? I'mma break it with my ghost powers after you pour your favorite drink. Want ghost shit all over your bed? No murder! 

Texting, emailing, phone calls, hanging out, yes.

I'm okay with sending pictures of myself and not a bot. 

If you're still reading, fuck yeah. Also, if I'm not what you're looking for, I hope you find some awesome friends.

It's officially my weekend. I don't plan on/want to do anything tonight/tomorrow(Friday) other than relax at home and maybe have a good conversation. If that's all it is, that's cool. If it leads to friendship or beyond, that's even better.

So what's on your mind?

Hey!

I am ready for a change in my life, and I'm thinking about moving to the Denver area. Right now, I live in Kansas City, and I really want to live in a more liberal/progressive part of the country, and I have been to Denver enough to know that ""in general"" Denver and Colorado match my morals a lot more than Kansas City & either Kansas or Missouri.

About me: I am a single, 29 y/o straight man coming from a mixed family background (My mum is Catholic; My father is Jewish). I am an extremely polite, nice, kind, person. Politically, I am definitely left of center (If you are even contemplating voting for Trump you can disregard this message; we wouldn't get along!) I love sports, and would be really excited to live close to the Rapids & an NBA team in particular. 

Right now, I am working PT at a furniture/home goods store that has several branches in the Denver area, so between 1 of these stores it would be probably easy for me to get a few hours a week to just get started, but I am wanting to change my employment situation.

I am going to get certified to ref soccer in March here in KC, and this will transfer with me to Colorado so I can ref soccer matches. I have a college degree in Recreation & Tourism Management, and I previously worked for the Philadelphia Eagles so I would be interested in getting involved with the Rapids, Nuggets, or one of the sports arenas.

Lastly, I am 420 friendly. As a former basketball player who has had 3 major knee surgeries, I do believe in the medicinal benefits of it for pain/arthritis. Once a resident of Colorado, I would be interested in getting my Med Badge and pursuing work opportunities in the MMJ industry. I do NOT need to smoke inside (although it would be nice) but like I said, I am a smoker so living with people that at least are morally OK with this is probably necessary.

That's me! I am looking for people to live with! New friends! I might only be working PT at first, but I have the financial ability to pay several months in advance with a security deposit, and I really need a ""home base"" as I pursue all these options I discussed.

Thanks for taking the time to read this post, and if I sound like I might be a fit for your home, or you know of someone who might be, I'd love to hear from you! Even if this is a temporary 1-4 month thing while I get settled and then find a different more permanent place to live, this could work too!

KC is not that far from Denver (I've been to Denver and Colorado a lot) so if anyone is interested in meeting me face to face it is no problem for me to drive out and meet people!

Hope to hear from some nice people! :-D

Cheers.

I have tix to Joe Satriani. The show is March 7, 8PM at the Paramount in Denver.

I bought the tickets a while back and the show snuck up on me. Thought what the heck I like a fair amount of his music and might be a good show. 

I'm married, my wife is not a fan of this kind of music, seems like my friends are busy, its a school night or they aren't fans either. 

So, I'm sincerely not looking for anything but a fan who might enjoy the show. Maybe we can have a bite to eat out somewhere before the show. I live N of Denver and don't get to explore it as much now as I used to.

Yep, just over 50 so I'm slowing down a tad. Like to cycle, hike and be outside like most CO folks. My musical tastes are all over the board. Big Zeppelin fan but have tickets to the Dead this summer too... Just for grins. Know of a place that has great pastry or a great appetizer? Maybe some local art on the wall...

Willing to chat or meet up this week for coffee or whatever to put anyone at ease. 

Anyway I'm pattering on. If something piques your curiosity please do say Hi.

Cheers

I am a good looking senior with no friends or family locally. I live alone and am going to have back surgery in a month or so. I will not be able to drive and take care of myself for a few weeks to a few months. I am looking for someone nearby who can help me with transportation to doctor appointments, to the hospital and back, errands, grocery shopping, light cooking, household chores and personal care until I get better. Any age range is OK as long as you can help me get to a standing position from a seated or lying down position and back again. I am willing to pay the going rate. At first it may be 24 hr per day until I see how independent I am. You may not have to be here if you live nearby and I can call you. I can supply references so you know who I am and can be trusted. I don't anticipate any medical needs other than pain meds.

It would be nice if a friendship or friendships if you have interested friends, developed as I need to increase my social activities. I am educated BS/MS. I manage real estate property for a living. I own my own house and have a steady income. I am a friendly sociable guy with varied interests. I like to travel again when my back is fixed. I have found it impossible to date or do anything that involves exercise or standing in line because of my back. Otherwise in good health. I like movies and TV shows. I am handy at fixing things around the house. I like going out to eat at a variety of restaurants.

If this sounds interesting to you, please send me a reply and a phone number and we can meet and go from there. You can ask me anything by email, if you like.
Thanks,
Doug

Hi there, I'd love to meet a great lady friend, who like me, has a full life with lots of passion and awesomeness to share with each other. 

About me. . . I'm a Colorado native with an athletic build, a contagious smile, and warm heart. I am single, down to earth, with a rewarding & successful career, a good head on my shoulders, and I'm someone who appreciates the little things in life. I also have a fun loving personality and an adventurous spirit. Age isn't a factor in meeting someone new, but you should have at least a bit of, adventurer in you, to explore new things and places together. Be it local activities like hiking, skiing, or around town for shows or just sharing good conversation etc. together. I have a lot of different interests and I'm open to new adventures myself. I'm 420 friendly. 

Anyway, if I piqued your interest, don't be shy - say hello and tell me about you!

Unfortunately I have found myself at the end of a relationship. If you have been there, you know how that feels. I am trying to move on and keep trucking. 

About me: I am 33, (will be 34 in a couple weeks), average built, non smoker (of anything and you must be too), non drinker (an occasional drink or glass of wine here and there), d&d free and plan on keeping it that way. I am a disabled vet. I served in the Air Force as a Police Officer for 6 years as my first career path till I was medically discharged. Since then, after a few government security jobs, I learned Audio/Video and was an A/V Tech for a church for another 6 years. I also continue to do freelance work for a tv studio and other A/V installs occasionally. I have now returned back to school full time and I am in my first semester at MSU pursuing a degree for Computer Science. 
I do have 3 kids from my first wife, a daughter who is 16, and two boys that are 14 and 12. They live in Illinois and I get them out here for a month during the summers, other than that, I am all alone except for my dog. I do NOT want more kids of my own and have also taken precautions to make sure such things don't happen. If this is an issue and you think you may want one or more later on, then I'm not your guy, sorry. I am not opposed to the fact that you may have your own.
I love the outdoors. I love to go hiking in the mountains. I also have a Trailblazer that I have extremely modified for off roading and love to hit trails whenever possible and especially shooting. I love to fish or just go for walks on a nice calm evening. One of my biggest woo-saw's (stress reliever, for those that don't know what woo-saw is), is listening to Zac Brown Band on a quiet evening sitting at my fire pit. I love to laugh and make people laugh. I am more of the shy type at first unless I get to know you or am around friends and company I am comfortable with and love to be a clown and become the entertainment. 

What am I looking for: That's a good question, I thought I had what I always wanted but that turned out to not be the case. First off, if anything was to lead toward any kind of a relationship, you must be faithful and trustworthy. (Trust and faithfulness is a big deal to me and I will not compromise.) Someone that is close to my age, mature (but has a good sense of humor and a goofy side), non-smoker (this includes mj!), no drugs of any kind, non, or light social drinker, and preferably not a mouth your mother would be ashamed to listen too. Also, I am not into bbw's, I'm sorry, but big girls are just not my type. You don't have to be skinny, average or a little extra is perfectly ok, I am just not attracted to bigger girls. 

I am not looking to jump straight into a serious relationship with the words of marriage being flung out next month, but I would like to meet some nice friends and see where things go. If there is a connection and it leads to more, I would not be opposed to it at all. If all of this sounds like something you feel you could match up to and/or would like to know more about, please at least say hi and don't be shy. I would love to hear from you. Good luck out there.

please put ""I read your post"" in the subject line so I know you are real. Thanx

Where society would frown if our secrets came out?

We are a tight knit group

those who have gone into hells abbyes and walked

Of
Those who have walked the fine line of functionality and ruin
Of 
Those who just like blowing pretty clouds.

If your taste is pointed toward green to just hang out and lean about 
OR maybe some black to take you back? 
Blow to go some more or some crystal white to see the light. 
We accept you as who you are and wish to create a special bond with you and your partner/significant other. 
We want you to reaffirm that YOU, no matter your 
Delicate desires, are not alone.

If you send us a little about you , tell us a short bio
And what makes you extraordinary. 
We will respond in a timely manner and hopefully make a lasting relationship
Fulfilling the needs and wants of each other
You can come see me or I can come see you

Looking forward to seeing you soon.

Hello!
I'm a 24 year old person just looking for more people to spend time with cause my friends are usually super busy and I've been going stir crazy.

I am not that good at talking about myself without any direction. xD

I suppose I should mention that you should be able to come to me as I have no transportation of my own and my work schedule makes taking the bus rather pointless. 

I'm a queer artsy nerd and down for most activities. 

Feel free to hit me up. Tell me about yourself. Send a pic and I'll send one back.
For now, you get this picture of me wearing way too much clothing last october in hopes that I'll get less people contacting me for a sexual encounter than I usually do when I post these.
(you have to send a picture to get a response from me.)

New guy in town and I'm looking for friends to go to shows and bars with. 

I like pretty much all types of music from old school punk to gangster rap. Country music is an exception; I'm not a fan. 

I'm also up for comedy shows, art exhibits, or just hanging out in the park. I'm not really big in to going to movies with ftiends as I can watch a movie by myself.

I feel that I should give a heads up as I have been finding some people take offense: I'm an atheist. However, I have no problem with any body's religious beliefs. 

Im truly looking for only a friend, so at the end of the night we part ways to our own places.

My husband and I have been living in Denver for about a year and a half now, and I really haven't had much luck making friends here. We moved here from Florida where I was stationed. I was active duty Air Force for 7 years and now serve in the Air Force Reserves. I am also a full time culinary student at Johnson & Wales. My husband is a nurse practitioner and a hobby machinist. We both love anime and go to San Diego Comic Con every year. We also workout and go hiking and biking often. We are not religious and people who are make us uncomfortable.
About Us:
30 year old female and 29 year old male, avid anime lovers(ask us about our figurine collection!), dog lovers (we have 3), happily married for 8 years, I'm quiet at first and takes me a little while to become comfortable with other people (never sure whats okay to say to other people, I'm very sarcastic and I think I'm hilarious (I'm often told I'm a little too mean)). He is very outgoing and loves bringing people together. We do not drink, smoke or do any drugs what so ever and would prefer friends who is the same, I am obsessed with makeup and frequent Sephora and Ulta on a semi-regular basis. I enjoy going shopping and it has been a while since I've been able to have a girls shopping trip (malls, shopping centers, yardsales, second hand stores, etc) and hubby is getting tired of being draggged along. We do not have children and am still not really comfortable around children yet ( I have no motherly instinct and borderline on being emotionally dead). I love cooking, baking and looking for and trying new recipes. We collect art from different comic conventions and are slightly obsessed with the Nightmare Before Christmas.
My favorite T.V shows are Charmed, Big Bang Theory, 2 Broke Girls, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Our taste in music is very random (country, Jpop, Rock, classic rock, 80's music, mowtown, etc) I think that should do it for now.

I'm a photographer, somewhere between amateur and professional, who is looking for a woman to take photos of. Please do not feel you have to look like a model--if you do, that's fine, but I'm not necessarily interested in that. Age, race, height, weight etc. are not important to me either (though please be over 18).

I'm more interested in art than portraiture, and I'm especially looking for faces that are interesting to me in some way--if you can convey a sense of playfulness or a sense of mystery, that's more of what I'm looking for. I am NOT interested in taking nude photos, or doing boudoir shoots. I'm just looking to take photos of you in whatever clothes you like in a location that in some way reflects your personality. Fully-clothed can include costumes if you wish, if you feel a costume would bring out your essence. 

If you are interested, please send a photo or two that includes your face. I'm posting this in ""Strictly Platonic"" because I'm not thinking of this as a business transaction, but a friendship of sorts. If we work well together and it works out for both of us, I may want to take some additional photos when the mood strikes either of us. Of course you can have copies of any or all of the photos to use however you like.

Let's run through the pros and cons shall we:
1. It could cure you random bouts of boredom 
2. You could laugh so hard you pee your pants ( not certain that's a pro)
3. You could have someone to bounce ideas off of such as should I switch jobs? Should I get a cat? Should I wear underwear today? Just to name a few 
4. You would have someone to flirt with ( I'm not very good at it, you probably won't even know I'm doing it!)
5. You would have someone to vent to, ex... Maybe you had too much to drink at the office Christmas party and secretly made out with your girlfriend and she ended up telling everyone ( not judging) or maybe you got home from the salon and your husband/boyfriend didn't notice your hair! In either case I would respond with a snappy and disbelieved ""ohh noo he/she didn't!"" And proceed with an intense conversation of how your friends are ugly and suck!
6. I'm from Iowa so know worries that your going to fall in love with my charming and witty banter and leave your spouse for me
7. I'm hot ( hey who doesn't want to talk to someone that's hot!)

Cons:
Yeah, I got nothing here

I haven't been out in months, not sure what I was waiting for but I'm sure it's passed by now. I want to come pick you up. We can eat at a restaurant of your choice or you can trust that I know some great places to eat. Like Mexican food? Me to! So it's settled. Well go to my favorite joint for dinner. After dinner we can go our separate ways or you can hang for evening. I plan on club hopping down town, or at least start there and see where the cards place us. I'm not a big drinker so no worries there. I do like to dabble in club favorites occasionally. I believe this is that occasionally mentioned above. So what do ya say? Wanna free night on the town? Good dinner and a safe fun filled evening with a fun loving and passionate guy? Well here's a bit about me.

I'm 37 years old 5'7 150lb. Proud parent, hard working and fun loving gentleman. I pay the bills and open doors. I know how to treat a lady. I'm creative and adventurous. I love to write and tell stories, I'm very outdoorsy, avid mountain climber and nature lover. I practice massage and have a nice office set up. I work construction by day and massage by night. Im not super social, I spend a lot of time alone. Working endless hours keeps me out of trouble. I dispize drama. Im Doing my best to simplify my life. I'm newly single after many years so I'm new to the single life . Living alone is awesome. I'm not looking for a girlfriend or to get married. I just want to enjoy tonight and hopefully tomorrow as well. So hit me up if your interested in getting out tonight. I'm thinking it's about that time for u as well. Let's go.

Hey there,

IDK why I'm doing this. On one hand I'm pretty done with the whole relationship thing, cause it always ends with pain. In other words I've kind lost hope. But on the other hand I have this stupid primal/biological desire for intimacy. It sucks even though my mind is telling me no my heart says yes. Its not that I have high standards but, specific standards. I just want some one normal, human, exciting. Some one that has there ups and downs but for reasonable reasons. Someone who can be eccentric about certain things and can back it up. I guess I just want someone with a good head on their shoulders. That to me is what is sexy.

So anyways if you just wanna hangout and chat, maybe hop in my hottub, or come up with some crazy adventurous date then email me. Pleas include a picture. I get it we all suck at taking pictures, just do the best you can.

Anyone notice how it's harder to make and keep friends as you age? I certainly have! A few have drifted apart while others have gotten married and have kids.

I'm a guy that is just interested in friends. No romance or sex please! Texting or emailing would be great. About anything! I'm a nerd so I like books, movies, comics, games, etc. But I'm not so isolated or stuffy to not be interested in other things too!

Maybe once we feel comfortable we could hang out? Lunch/Dinner, museums, hiking. Whatever! I'm easy going and non judgement. Craigslist is a long shot but if anyone is interested drop me a line! Take care!

I have an opportunity I would like to offer to a female in her mid-50s/early 60s but there's a problem with putting this under ""jobs"" -- I really need someone who is a friend, or at least friendly, first and foremost. We have to talk and get to know each other -- sorry! Haha, that's just how it is. Yes, I do have a real-life female friend but she lives in another state. I need somebody who lives closer than that. This can and will definitely lead to a business or job opportunity (not to mention adventure and fun). 

So: You should be a smart, personable gal in her 50s/60s. You should be friendly and open to being friends with somebody like me. What kind of person am I? I'm not a guy! I have lots of different interests. I need one or possibly two people to do as-needed type work with pay dependent on skill and commitment level. Having some computer smarts and an internet connection, as well as a land line and your own transportation, will definitely help, but are not strictly necessary. A car and a driver's license will be needed, however. 

Otherwise, you'll find out when you answer the ad. (NOT looking for a hookup, dates, etc. Please do not reply if that is your interest. Also I am not interested in investing in YOUR business or buying insurance from you, or anything of that nature.) 

Hope to hear from you soon!

PS, let me reiterate that this I'm not looking for sex. If that's your interest, please move on. 

If you are broke and/or need a place to live, it's ok to reply to this ad. I've been in the same boat myself and I will help you out if I can. I will at least listen. I used to work in the mental health system so I might be able to help you find resources if nothing else.

Having been involved in athletics and personal training for 30+ years,
I've achieved a lot of my personal targets around athletics and my body.
I've been stuck on the couch and shifted back into movement all the while thinking I don't have the time to exercise or eat right.

I've learned what really created the shifts for me to be able to achieve these targets I had for myself. It isn't the work or effort I put into it, it wasn't forcing discipline or faking that having patience was fine. It was a shift in how I was choosing to think. How I think about the target itself and how I think about the journey vs the end goal.

I can show you this, build a plan for you around your exercise, nutrition and the mindfulness habits to support and get you to your targets!

Would you be interested in a complimentary 30 minute discovery session to see what is possible for you, and if we can build this plan together to achieve your targets?

There is no obligation to hire me, and you will walk away with at least one tool you can employ right now to help you!

Do you have a desire to feel more at ease with life, no matter what is going on?

Having your Bars run can do just that. There are 32 points on your head that correspond to things like; healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named.

They store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything.

For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called ""money.""

Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it, clearing the space for new awareness to come in.

The creative possibilities for your life begin to open up!

It's been said that at worst a Bars session will feel like a great massage. At best, it will change your life!

Are you interested in seeing what a 60 or 90 minute Bars session can do for you?

Hi lonely people, I'm pretty lonely myself. Please don't get me wrong, I have friends, great friends actually, they're just all men. I would like female friends up here in Colorado. 

I'm not your local Colorado mountain man, I'm from Arkansas and where I come from, there was jack shit to do. I enjoy sci-fi, video games, comics (I don't care about the marvel/DC battle), learning about random stuff, and just working on myself. I think I'm fun, just don't really know how to make friends of the opposite sex that can respect that I don't just want to fuck them. I'm not in a place to be in a relationship and I don't know about casual sex, that depends on the person. 

I'm also not an overweight basement dweller that lives with his parents. :p

So, the bad. I have a panic disorder and go to intensive therapy. It's sometimes difficult for me to bounce out and go exploring. Until I figure this out, I don't want to fall in love. I mean, yes, I do. I just can't financially support very much and will not let another potential partner just take care of me, that's not fair and I have ended relationships because I wasn't getting better. They deserved better. :/ It fucking sucks.

Now that the bad is out of the way, I think that I'm a sweet, supporting, positive person. I'm pretty sure that I'm funny and generally a great person, I write this because my friends are amazing and have never let me down and I do my best not to be a shit friend.

It would be great to find someone that lived near me. Honesty is always appreciated. If we did become intimate I would like to know if you do sleep with someone else. Our friendship can continue but the sexual relationship will have to stop. I am not discriminate of age or race. Just looking for a friend I can go out with on occasion, cuddle and watch movies/Netflix with, play board games with, make dinner with and just have someone to talk to.

Somebody to do things with.

Spring is nearly here and I'm looking to get out and have some fun with good people.
Honestly up for damn near anything.
BUT I would appreciate somebody who likes going out, having some drinks, and catching some live music.
I don't mean crowded and expensive amphitheater shows.
More like....dive bars.heh
I guess most of my favorite stuff would full under ""Rock"" but I'm not too fussed about genres.
I like all sorts of music.

Not just live music.
Also wouldn't mind somebody to just go out for coffee with,see movies, or just provide some company on a boring day!


Obviously I'd like to get to know you a bit first.
Email, maybe text, stuff like that.

I miss the closeness that comes with the companionship of a good woman. Maybe you're in a marriage and you are missing this closeness as well. Why is it so difficult for men and women to get close to each other and become best of friends? I know that this sometimes leads to unintended circumstances unless they might just be intended in the first place. Hell, I don't really get any of it other than I know what is missing in my life. If you need to fill some emptiness in your life too, feel free to get in touch. We can negotiate our friendship to be what ever we want it to be.

Nothing crazy or abnormal, just excitement with a stranger. If you can squirt that's amazing. If you masturbate that's even better. Love big full breasts on a full figured woman.

Do you need to be spanked or just like the idea?

Hello there, lonely traveler!

My name is Rey and for pretty much all my life, I've been a loner. I've always found one distraction or another to occupy my time, but lately they aren't working like they used to. I'm starting to realize people weren't meant to live alone, so I think I'd like to give this friendship thing another shot. 

About me: I'm the prototypical introvert. I mainly like to read, write, listen to music, and surf the web for interesting content, but I like getting outdoors for hikes and long walks too. I'm also down to just sit and talk as long as no BSing is involved. I'm not really sure what we'd do together, but I'm up for almost anything as long as it's strictly platonic.

Don't really care what demographics you fall under, I'm just interested in finding genuine people. If you'd like for us to get to know each other, message me with your favorite Pokemon in the subject line.

I ache to have a female friend to whom I can tell absolutely anything, someone who is open minded and not judgmental who would listen to my fantasies, my silly thoughts, my confessions, and anything, really. I mainly seeking actual conversation (not texting or tons of emails), and I'm really not interested in meeting, let alone any kind of hookup. If you would be willing to talk or just listen, please let me know. If the ad is up, I'm still looking. As for me, I'm 37 years old, and I have a professional career that I love. I'm into all kinds of things, from art and music, to hiking and travelling, to MMA and football. If you want to know what I look like, I'll gladly tell you or trade a G-rated pic. I'll be curious who I'm dealing with as well. Since I'm just looking for a conversation thing, your race, looks, size, age, relationship status, etc. aren't important to me. If you'd like to talk, why not say hello and make my day?

Have you ever wanted confirmation, or clarification about what is happening in your life?

Do your own thoughts at times distort or override your own intuitive instincts?

Are you curious, as to how accurate and meaningful a reading would be to you?

I am blessed to have worked with my gifts extensively over the past few years. I do readings for friends, and other business associates. My accuracy in discerning and reading energy with very little information has been affirmed over and over again.

What I am offering for you today is a simple one card reading. All that I ask is that you reply to this post and provide your ""First Name"" in the subject line.

If you find the one card reading relevant, you can ask for more information about other types of readings I do. I do these readings for ""free"" and will never ask you for money. 

I am a male in my early 40's who doesn't live in your area. I am not looking for a date. I am simple offering to share my gifts with you. Have a blessed and wonderful day.

Hi There,

I'm a sweet, sane, average guy in the south metro area looking for a friend (or more ) to spend some time with. looking for a woman of any age, but preferably close to my age or older so we might have a little more in common. Looks mean nothing to me, a nice person with a kind heart does.
The trade you ask?... I came out here for a couple weeks for work and the job got finished early.
I have a flight on Friday back home. Until then, I'm offering myself as basically a slave in exchange for a place to stay until then. I can do handyman stuff, help around the house, or anything you might need, literally anything ( yes, even windows...lol). Imagine... Your own personal slave, and a cool guy too. very few things are off the table as far as what I will do for you. Even if I need to stay in a garage or shed, you have someone that will do ANYTHING you want. My company only covers me on the days I work, and I kind of overspent my per diem. Basically, if you help me out for a couple nights, I'll help you.
Think about it, let me know, and have an awesome day.

You: You're already settled into life but looking for something more. Maybe you're ignored at home or maybe you're unable to introduce excitement into your life there. You miss the flattery of someone taking interest in you or for complimenting you for the small things: the cute shoes you put on this morning, that twirl of hair that hangs down next to your cheek, or how the color of your blouse complements your eyes. You'd like a momentary diversion, even if it's just an occasional coffee for 30 minutes.

You Get Bonus Points: If you're the intellectual type, a little geeky, perhaps even a little shy, you get extra credit. If you have long hair, you get an automatic 'A'.

Me: I'm intelligent and an extrovert. I'm witty, occasionally silly, but always funny. I'm professional, mature, and stable. I'm 6 foot 3 and height/weight proportionate. 40 years old, but often get told I look younger. I'm told that I'm cute, but I'll let you decide that for yourself.

Next: Send me a note and we'll see what happens from there. If we connect, great. If not, there's no harm done. I am looking for someone to connect with on an intellectual and charismatic level and am not looking for a hookup. I am immensely discreet and you should be, too. Take a chance and re-discover yourself. So I know you're not a spam bot, put your hair color in the subject line.

I want us to learn how to push the others buttons, really explore what they like no matter how ""taboo or frowned upon"" they may be. I don't care about your marital status, I only ask that you be over 18 and not take 5 days to respond. This is a place to explore our fantasies together that is completely free from judgement and with zero risk of catching anything or actually cheating! Today you can be a shy housewife with a passion for delivery guys and tomorrow you can be the CEO of your own company with a flock of men who meet all of your needs. I am aware that this is not for everyone, but it's for a very specific someone. Someone who writes in complete sentences, has a vivid imagination and has a bit of a filthy mind.

I'm a single, mature, DDF, potsmoking introvert who's just moved here from the east coast to build my new life.

This, of course, is a heroic undertaking- and I'm doing a great job of making a place for myself. I have my own apartment, located close to downtown. I work hard and do well. I take care of my friends and family... What I don't do is get out and socialize. I don't play the ""new friend I met over drinks"" game. I like to work hard, and I prefer to spend my tips on cooking great food and smoking good herb... But that makes it hard when ""human nature"" rears its thirsty head. I want a woman in my life. I just don't want to be your boyfriend/husband until I really have my shit together. But in the meantime, there's got to be a woman who wants to share time with someone interested in success and challenging himself to improve and evolve!

I don't want to sound like a creeper, but I'm very interested to be in a friendship that walks the line of platonic and ""friendship with benefits"". I think we should talk about what I mean specifically once we engage in private email correspondence.

I'm really chill about this. I have thought it through and I definitely want to encourage you to respond with any questions or concerns. Let's get philosophical and ask why I'd even do this. I'm an open book with a desire to keep things respectful and dignified and with the intent of making us both benefit from this arrangement.

This is probably a very weird post coming from a guy, But here it goes.
I am looking for a woman that wants to sleep with me once in a while. Sounds like all the other posts so far, Read on!
I am not talking about sex, I am talking about curling up next to me and sleeping through the night next to each other. 
I was married for 12 years and slept next to my wife, when I wasn't travelling, every night! After My divorce I dated a wonderful woman who would sleep with me almost every weekend. and even after we stopped dating, we are friends and she would sleep with me once or twice a month. She recently got engaged and feels she can not come for ""sleepovers"" any more and I respect her wishes. 


Lets do some friend stuff, grab a beer, go out for a nice dinner or order in and watch a movie, tell each other life stories, get to know each other and at the end of the night cuddle up and get some rest.

If you think maybe you would like an arrangement like this, are on the west side, and want a nice warm man to wrap his arms around you in bed, let me know. I tend to like smaller women, but I am not ruling anything out.

I am well educated, well read, well traveled, great conversationalist and great cook.
If you want to know more please email me.

Hello,

I need to get out of the house more and so I'm looking for a standing weekly date to go out do stuff with. Digital socializing is fine and all except it's like eating soyrizo when you really want the big chorizo. So ideally maybe we start by emailing each other multi paragraph, intense, emails detailing our beliefs about the future of humanity as alien pets. Then we have a beer. Then we get into the heavy business: plays, cemeteries, art, bug inspecting, languid strolls. I will get to hear your stories. I will get to care about you. 

Me. I've got enough education to kill a small pony. I'm highly impractical, but generally responsible. I'm in an open marriage, but both my wife and my girlfriend are very busy people. I'm a dad so I typically spend my Friday nights folding laundry. I'm an ecology dork that likes art museums and restaurants over hiking 14ers. I'm a little strange, but in a good way. For some reason I tend to make better friends with women. It's always been that way. 

Okay, well I'm going to send this out into deep space and see what kind of life forms I find. FYI. This is not about sexting or cyber or anything like that. I'm mostly looking to end up with real time conversations in pleasant company. 

Talk to you later, hopefully.

Who thinks a once in a decade bloom in Death Valley means road trip? I'm tied up the next week, maybe two, but after that I'm thinking about taking the dogs for a trip to the backside of the south Sierra's. I've never been but always wanted to see the valley they call death in full bloom.

I know I am not the only one that thinks this so if this sounds like fun let me know and we should grab a tea or drink or smoke up.

I am a 40's male that has always liked the outdoors. I am single and not looking for this trip to serve as a date, but rather have some companionship with a cool person taking a short break to see and maybe smell the flowers. Camping would be nice if the weather is ok. If you have a friend that wants to go, great, however another vehicle would be needed. I'm cool with a couple too, m4mw, but that might be more a ""couples"" thing on your own.

So... I'm gonna take a chance, roll the dice, maybe make a buddy.

My name is Reese, I'm a 24 year old transmasculine guy living currently in the Denver metro area. I identify as a transguy (ftm) and I'm looking for texting buddies, since I work a lot and currently in between housing. I'm not looking for hook ups, friends with benefits, or anything like that. If we wind up do clicking to meet in public (which has rarely happened, not because I enjoy being anonymous, I have social awkwardness that leads to social anxiety), please understand I will wind up being silent a lot of the times, as I'm very shy. Now that is out of the way, let me spill about my positive attributes...

I'm an aspiring chef (with a current title of dishwasher, but I have a lot of recipe ideas, just no real way for me to create them given my situation. I really enjoy watching the Food Network (Chopped especially), and when I can, the Create channel on basic cable. I'm partnered with an amazing guy who is very important to me. I love beer but I don't drink it to excess, in fact, I prefer cooking with it. I'm a bit of a geek as well, I am a major fanboy of Doctor Who, which I can quite passionately talk about if given half a chance. I do enjoy reading but however, I rarely find time to because of the chaos I have been thrusted in. I do write a bit, usually while listening to some form of music that inspires a scene in my head (Last of the Wilds by Nightwish has recently inspired something just not sure what yet as the scene has yet to be written).

What I'm looking for... well that is quite a mixed bag. I'm looking for someone who would understand that I am very... awkward in person, someone who would tolerate texting some random guy who is quirky yet generous, human but a mystery. I am mostly seeking some sort of companionship but from a distance. If you are that person, feel free to reply to this ad, however to weed out those pesky robots who phish for people to join their websites and such, I ask that in the subject line, you put your top beer and food combos (Beyond beer and pizza, or beer and burgers).

Garage sale season is starting! Im looking for my new cute and petite female friend who likes to hit the sales on the weekends! If interested...read on...

I resell a lot of stuff on eBay, Craigslist, and at a couple booths I have at an antique mall. I buy all my merchandise at garage sales, thrift stores, storage unit auctions and estate sales. So...its not a ""lets stop and have some breakfast"" type of morning for me if there are a lot of sales. Ive got to get from one to the next as quickly as possible. After 10 or 11 the stops can get a little slower as most of the good resellable stuff is gone by then. 

A little about me... late 40s, white guy, considered attractive with a little extra around the middle. 

A little about you... 25 to 50, cute and petite, someone who can show up on time, maybe wanting to learn about reselling on eBay, positive attitude and fun to be around.

Email if interested.

What if working out and proper nutrition was more than just a Means to
lose weight and get into shape?

What if it was a catalyst to shifting your life?

In my years as a trainer I have noticed one amazing thing about
purposeful movement and good nutrition. It gives people to confidence
to do amazing things with their lives!

People step up into better engagement in their jobs, relationships, in their lives!
Of course a healthier body shows up along for the ride, but are you ready to really shift your life?

How about a complementary exploratory session to see what is possible?

I wouldn't be opposed to meeting down the road or the possibility of a LTR.

That is my slightly indecent proposal.
I'm recently divorced and in an odd twilight zone.
Many of the women I meet are very attractive but looking for that elusive LTR.
I'm tall, 6 ft, reasonably good looking, travelled and educated. I enjoy the city things, eating out, shows, wandering aimlessly. I'm into the outdoors big time and moved to Colorado to ski , bike etc.
My plan is we reserve one night a week to meet, do something together then retire and relax with each other.
Beyond that each can pursue, or not, the ""right"" quarry for the long term.
In the mean time we have some one to go out and stay in with.
The ultimate double dipping, the immediate gratification of a satisfying relationship with the peace of mind that you can still look for the one.

Wide and far I'll be off at once

You'll be spinning fast loud and clear

Hi everyone! My name is Fabiola an inmate at a Federal prison. I am looking for friends to correspond with through email and/or snail mail. Reading, writing, working out and listening to music are some of the things I enjoy the most. I am attracted to responsible, romantic, caring, mature and successful individuals(men or women). I believe firmly that age, race, choice of religion, or gender should not matter in any type of relationship. People are to be respectful, loyal honest, franc and nonjudgmental to be in my life.

Please send me a message if you want to get to know me. I am using a third party and will need your first, last name, and your email address. I will then send you an email request through corrlinks, the prison computer system. Once you accept me , we can start emailing each other directly. Thank you and may whatever higher power you believe in, bless you.

I am looking for someone who would like to read and enjoy erotic stories that I love to write. First off I am happily married and don't intend to change that so no pressure from my end trying to hook up, just some enjoyable emails including stories I write and maybe some you want to share with me. I spend many nights a week alone in hotel rooms and this is one of the ways I like to pass the time. If your interested read my story below and drop me a note to let me know if you enjoyed it. 

""The View""

You board the plane anxiously knowing that a forbidden friend bought you the ticket. As you pass the cockpit, you glance in seeing if this is all for real. I look back knowing you are there, our eyes catch each others for a brief moment. Butterflies enter your stomach as you continue to slowly make your way down the isle, waiting for everyone to stow their bags, wondering if anyone notices you don't have any. It was after all only two hours ago while you sat at your desk at work that you got the call to go to the airport for this mysterious flight. Still wearing your work clothes, you blend right in with the business class passengers. Short tight skirt, slightly open blouse exposing just enough to make the other men in the plane take quick glances in your direction. As you settle into your seat only knowing that the flight will eventually land in Las Vegas, not knowing how long you will be there or the reason for this mysterious flight, the flight attendants make their announcements. You barely hear what they say because you are lost in the nervous excitement. As the plane takes off, you start to panic, what the hell am I doing here?!? Just then the person next to you asks if you are traveling for business or pleasure. You pause as you contemplate the complicated answer, then only saying, ""a little bit of both."" You sit there nervously feeling like everyone knows you are here on a taboo meeting with a guy that only a few weeks ago responded to a silly little ad you placed on craigslist one horny morning. Right then you are interrupted again, this time by the co-pilot, you snap out of your daydream slightly startled. Excuse me miss, the captain asked me to have you come up to the flight deck. You quickly stand up, making the passengers in this post 9/11 world a bit nervous, as you walk to the front of the airplane. The door swings open as you arrive, and you notice the co-pilot did not follow you in. You look forward amazed at the beautiful sunset lighting up the whole flight deck. You look at me, our eyes locked again, this time there is no long pause as I say, ""I am glad you showed up tonight"" You say nothing and bend down to kiss me. Your tasty wet lips against mine as we embrace each other, locked together. I turn on the speaker so I can still hear the radio as I take off my headset and stand up to join you. My hands traveling down the small of your back then slowly up your blouse. I reach up and free your beautiful curvy breasts from the restraints they have been in all day. You gasp slightly at the forwardness of my actions since we were in such a public place, and we have never actually even met yet. 

I slide down, kissing your neck as I make my way down toward your now throbbing warm breasts. I can feel your breath as I lay my face against your chest, longingly running my tongue across your nipples. You put a finger under my chin and guide me up back to your face. ""My turn,"" you exclaim. You run your hands across my chest, pushing my tie to the side against the wings pinned to my shirt. Your hands continue down across my stomach, pulling my shirt out of my pants. You unbuckle my belt and slide your hand down into my dress slacks, where there is an ever increasing bulge forming. You gently stroke just two fingers along my now rock hard cock. Then suddenly you grab it tightly and squeeze showing me the force I am about to experience when I slide my cock into your tight waiting pussy.

I take you in my arms once again this time guiding your hands forward onto the dashboard of the airplane which leaves you straddled like you were being arrested. A thought flashes through your mind, can I be arrested for having sex in an airliner? At that moment I snap you back into reality once again as I quickly unzip the back of your tight skirt. I slide it down revealing the boy short panties below. I run my tongue down the small of your back, grabbing your panties with my teeth and pulling them down eventually letting them fall around your ankles. A quick slide of my finger confirms what I already know, your body is getting ready to take the hard cock still strangled in my pants. The sweet smell of your wetness comes across my nose as I lick the rest of your natural juices off my now hot wet finger.

This sends me over the edge, and I throw my pants down around my ankles near your panties. I guide my penis up and down the amazing curves your natural body has. Finally as the tip brushes against your waiting pussy lips I can take no more. With one complete thrust every inch of my cock slides effortlessly deep inside of you. You though your head back as you feel every fold of your vagina caress the shaft of my cock. I say ""no,"" keep looking forward. You tilt your head back down and feel a sudden rush as you see nothing but open sky and a fiery sunset ahead of you. Your mind has a hard time comprehending what your body is experiencing, you feel my cock sliding in and out of you as your mind believes you are flying free as a bird. Your body shudders as the first signs of your upcoming orgasm almost take you off of your feet. I wrap my arms around your waist supporting you as your head drops and an uncontrollable grunt comes out from deep inside of you. Your pussy tightens up and I feel your lips trying to strangle my cock with each pulse of your orgasm. Then I feel your body slack as you come down off of that euphoric high. I keep the pace going as my cock begs to be released into your hot willing body. I try to hold out, and when I think I can't hang on any longer I feel it again, your pussy pulsing cumming with another orgasm, this one making you loose your grip on the dashboard, and I catch you by the waist once more but this time you feel my hot load filling your pulsing pussy as I try my best to keep us upright. The strength of my orgasm causes my legs to give out and we collapse to the right, falling onto the co-pilots seat. We lay there holding each other trying to catch our breath together. 

You turn your head and kiss me again locking me lips and tongue into this crazy thing we just did. We look into each others eyes and just stare, neither one knowing quite how to recover and return to our reality, knowing full well that the passengers in the first class cabin most certainly heard what just happened. We get up, straightening our clothes, sharing another passionate kiss before I pick up the phone, and call my graciously waiting co-pilot. He returns to the flight deck, sliding close to your body trying to trade spots in the small space occupying the tip of this sex toy looking machine that gets people where they need to go. As he slides by you feel the tip of yet another penis, this one being held tight in the slacks of my co-pilot. Knowing my plan all along, he waited in the galley for us to have our secret little meeting. He admires your beautiful face, still flushed from our time together.

You walk back to your seat, feeling my love drip slowly out of you and into your now soaked panties. As you sit, you wonder if anyone knows what just happened, when suddenly the man sitting next to you says ""How was the view?"" 


Hope you liked my story, email me and when I get to know a bit about you I will write one for you ;) Trading stories or photos is always welcomed with excitement! I get turned on by all body types as long as you are as horny as me so don't be shy!

OK so not strictly platonic but if we're attracted to each other wouldn't it be a shame if we didn't have a little fun also? How much older? Well how about 50 to say 65 give or take a few years as long as you are a dominant man. Bi or married preferred but not a deal breaker.

Hello! 

After some mild introspection I've realized I'm in a bit of a rut. Good job, nice house but nothing really exciting going on. I want to mix things up a bit and take a stranger out for a fun night in Blackhawk next week. I'm not much of a gambler but I do know enough to teach any willing party how to play Blackjack or Craps or Poker (happy to pay your way if it seems like you'd enjoy the game!). Or if you're an expert I am fantastic at hand signals and cryptic dialogue to take down the house. Really just looking for someone super fun to hang out with and enjoy some free drinks and conversation, and hey, maybe win a little money while we're at it!

I keep getting these free room vouchers in the mail (seriously, I have like 6 now, I don't know what to do with them all) so I thought I'd use two of them next Wednesday night (3/9). As this is in the ""strictly platonic"" section I did want to throw out there that you'd have a totally private free room to yourself (just try to keep the room service bill under a few grand ;). I'm pretty easy to get along with but it's a lot to ask a stranger to come up to Blackhawk for the evening so just wanted to make sure you know there's a safety net there in case we end up being incompatible people. 

If any of this sounds fun to you and you've got some free time next Wednesday night let me know. I'm not looking for any age in particular (older than 21, of course). I just turned 30 myself. Just someone up for a fun and different evening than the usual! Happy to send pics via email so you can make sure I'm not a gremlin beforehand. Hope to talk to you soon!

Hi, 
I'm looking for fun people to hike, bike, explore, and adventure with as the weather warms up.
As the title says, I'm 34 years old and I love to eat healthy and push on heavy things at 24 hour fitness. I'm a native and spring is my favorite season as I really don't like winter too much. I love being outdoors this time of year just as the days get a bit longer and the sun becomes a little warmer. My favorite day of the year is daylight savings when we get our extra hour of evening light. Love it!

I'm into indie rock/up beat/obscure types of music that give you goose bumps they're sooo good. I don't watch sports, or play video games, or smoke pot, or get super hammered any more but I have been known to bring a back pack full of beer on a hike or two. I used to like to tube Boulder creek quite a bit and think I'll be getting back up there this summer again. 
Also, my family has a super rad cabin just past boulder that I love to spend time at. No running water, or electricity, but it totally adds to the charm and there's a new mine I just discovered nearby.... I'm totally gonna (safely) spelunk it!
Also,
I love good food, and hitting up the Mayan or Esquire for a strange movie. Indian lunch buffets are awesome, hot springs rock, and estate sales are fun. I haven't been to the flea market in a couple years....I want to check out Eldorado Spgs. pool for the history of it and Bishops Castle for the sheer quirkiness! Definitely on my list.

If you're interested in getting to know a new partner in crime then shoot me a note! What do you do for fun?

Cheers!

Long story short, I was always one of those fat chicks who clearly didn't care enough about herself to put in any time or effort into her appearance. My mom was the same way and I have all male friends; I never really learned anything about how to dress, how to do hair, how to do makeup, etc. 

In the last year I've lost 80lbs and gone from obese to not. I currently weigh less than my lowest high school weight, and I'm wearing a pants size I haven't ever been able to wear.

I want to learn how to be more feminine. Dressing my body has always been about hiding it, now I'd like to learn how to put together cute outfits and accentuate my positive features. I've never worn makeup, so I watched some tutorials and bought some basic drugstore stuff. I still don't wear it because I worry a lot about looking like a clown. I don't have another woman around who would freely and honestly tell me where I could improve and it's making it very hard to judge how well I'm doing it. 

And the hair; I have 2+ feet of it that I don't know what to do with. I can french braid it, but usually it's just parted and pulled into a ponytail or nautilus bun because I just don't know how else to wear it. Everything I've tried from tutorials and such comes out looking wonky and I can't figure out why. 

I live a pretty frugal lifestyle and I'd like to try to learn these things on a budget. I tend to shop only at thrift stores and places like Ross, and I'll get occasional pieces from Target or wally world. My small makeup collection is mostly drugstore/low end. That doesn't mean I won't spend money when I believe it's worth it, but I'm highly interested in learning how a girly girl might shop sales or thrift stores. 

Other than that, I'm a married 26 year old with a humble occupation and no children. We have a place and cars and are otherwise stable and drama free. I recently discovered I'm really into nail polish and nail care (I'd love to do at-home manis or try different nail art techniques with someone, I have a lot of tools and supplies!) I play piano and violin poorly. When it warms up some, I'm hoping to start running with the C25K app. My husband and I spend our limited free time watching movies and Netflix (currently watching ST:DS9,) playing various PC games and (more recently) casually learning MtG. We are 420 friendly, but if you aren't I'm not pushy and don't mind being sober. I have a severe alcohol intolerance, so am unable to drink. 

I'm hoping to make friends with anyone in my general age range (trying to gauge how people my age dress and such) who are interested enough in clothes, makeup and/or hair to teach a stranger what they know. Let's get coffee and chat, maybe go shopping together sometime. Let's try out new and different things. If you even just want a text buddy that's ok too. 

Please put a favorite brand name in the subject line. Thanks much for reading.

Having been involved in athletics and personal training for 30+ years,
I've achieved a lot of my personal targets around athletics and my body.
I've been stuck on the couch and shifted back into movement all the while thinking I don't have the time to exercise or eat right.

I've learned what really created the shifts for me to be able to achieve these targets I had for myself. It isn't the work or effort I put into it, it wasn't forcing discipline or faking that having patience was fine. It was a shift in how I was choosing to think. How I think about the target itself and how I think about the journey vs the end goal.

I can show you this, build a plan for you around your exercise, nutrition and the mindfulness habits to support and get you to your targets!

Would you be interested in a complimentary 30 minute discovery session to see what is possible for you, and if we can build this plan together to achieve your targets?

There is no obligation to hire me, and you will walk away with at least one tool you can employ right now to help you!

Do you have a desire to feel more at ease with life, no matter what is going on?

Having your Bars run can do just that. There are 32 points on your head that correspond to things like; healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named.

They store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything.

For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called ""money.""

Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it, clearing the space for new awareness to come in.

The creative possibilities for your life begin to open up!

It's been said that at worst a Bars session will feel like a great massage. At best, it will change your life!

I am looking for decent people who are knowledgeable about rockhounding and mining claims in colorado as well as know of good outdoor spots in general. I am a 28 year old father of two. Me, my wife and kids just moved here from portland oregon. I consider my self as a wellrounded and open minded individual. Would be nice to meet people who know the area and would like weekend adventures. Also looking at property and could use some insight. My sister and her wife are very chill as well as their friends.
About me... I love the outdoors. Camping, fishing, hiking, offroading, biking, rock hounding, etc. I enjoy a challenge and if something breaks I fix it. If I get an idea I will go with it (usually resulting in me building something). I dont care for big crowds. My goal is to buy some property (40 acres or more), get toys, have a garden, be self sustaining, make money doing things i love, etc.
What i would like to find in individuals... knowledge, loyalty, honesty, up for new things(not sexually), adventurous, open minded, goal oriented, follow through, etc.
side notes... i smoke (will be quiting), 420 sometimes, drink casual. If you do these things then thats your journey and if not then i will respectfully not do them around you if thats your wish. look forward to meeting some good friends and thanks for reading.

Hi there. My name is Rob. I used to live in Denver several years ago and now I'm returning for a visit from 3/8 to 3/13. I live in Ohio currently and just can't seem to find a woman here who I like. I would like to meet a white woman in Denver for some fun and travel in CO. I am extremely attracted to both red heads and women with dark features. But if you don't fit into that category, please don't worry about it. I am pretty flexible with age. I would say anywhere from 25 - 43 is fine. I am really NOT into women with kids though. However, if I met the right woman, I'd like to have kids with her one day. 

I would really like someone to connect with more than anything else. I'm a good guy with a little bit of a wild streak, fun, articulate, and will talk about anything under the sun with you. I like to hike, fish, go white water rafting, go to the breweries, and have a very strong interest in holistic and metaphysical things. But at the same time I am also very grounded. I just got a new job in the IT field that I am starting right after I return home. In the meantime, this is my time for fun and adventure! And I would love to hang out with someone fun, who is kind, warm, caring, affectionate, grounded and who I can relate to and talk with easily. Please respond and I will provide more information so we can talk more.

Firstly, I wanted to start by saying I'm looking for PLATONIC friendship. Not many people on CL know what that means -- it's a FRIEND; nothing sexual or weird. No, platonic people don't ""hang out nude"" so stop creepin.

That said, i'm a straight/married guy looking for like minded people to hang out with. I've lived in Colorado for 3 years now and have not had much luck finding people around my aged with similar interests. 

About me:
*A little big into video games but not overly so, like some people can be. I simply like hanging out, playing PS4 online, or playing the occasional couch co-op game with chill dudes. I'm not super competitive, but I can be if people want a more ""serious"" match of CoD or something. Otherwise, I prefer laid back gaming on GTA5 or Destiny, etc.

*I'm into fitness and bettering myself. I do go to the gym 4 days a week and i'm working on putting on more muscle weight. That said, i'm not a meathead. I'm just finally trying to get some positive change going.

*I work a Mon-Fri job with steady income. But even between work and gym, I still have time to hang out/etc.

*I love the mountains and the outdoors, especially in warmer weather. I wouldn't say I'm super active, but the occasional mountain drive or camping is right down my ally.

*My wife and I try to get out to movies, bowling, mall, shooting pool, etc. We enjoy exploring many local breweries. I haven't been drinking as much as I used to due to trying to stay healthier, but I can't help the fact that there are so many good beers in my area!

I'm really hoping to find people in their early to mid 20s to hang with. If interested, reply with some info about yourself. I'm in Thornton and it would be awesome to find people with similar interests in my area.

Hi 😀
I'm a nice guy looking for a sweet, cute and funny girl to go places and do things with. I have a lot of interests and am always open to new ideas. I have been in Colorado for a little over a year and was married when I got here, but now I'm separated and my wife is in Florida indefinitely. I miss all the things that couples do together but I'm not looking for sex or a relationship any deeper than a great friendship. That being said I am very affectionate and love holding hands and cuddling. I like going to dinner and movies, concerts, grungy dive bars, casinos and flea markets I'm a little on the older side, 53, but I look and act younger. I'm told I'm good looking and funny. If you are interested and hanging out let me know. I would prefer someone local. Age doesn't matter. You can be younger or older. I'm polite, friendly and respectful. And I hate to even have to mention this but I am not a psycho 😀

I am a senior gentleman looking for a mature lady that would enjoy meeting and working out together on week day mornings at Goodson Rec Center. I am married and discreet. I have posted before but not had any luck so far.

Looking to lose some weight and a lady that is open to stimulating conversation, a little flirting and teasing and meeting regularly would certainly increase the motivation! I don't care about your race, size, status or looks, just be a fun loving lady that would enjoy walking the track, using the machines, maybe a swim and hot tub with an older gentleman who is easy on the eyes, easy going, fun and open minded! 

I am down from 245 to 230 and would like to get to 205 but have hit a plateau and thought this might be a good way to jump start further loss! Tell me what your goal might be? Put ""Let's meet at Goodson!"" in the subject to help weed out spam.

Hi there and happy monday! I'm a 32 year old married guy who is looking to add someone new and special to my life. I can't leave the situation that I'm in... But I miss the excitement and comfort of really being attracted to someone. I'm looking for long term and serious. Now that word tends to throw people off so let me explain what I mean...

By serious I just mean real. I'm a real person on the end of this conversation, as are you! If things click I will think of you often, and think of ways to make you happy, as I would any partner in my life. I will light up inside when I see a message arrive from you, I want to trade pictures often ( naughty, nice and everything in between), I will genuinely want to know how your day was... And if I fall in love (and I might!) I will tell you, and tell you often. A real relationship to me doesn't mean you need to leave your spouse, fly across the world and ever meet me. It just means we're in this together...

If you've made it this far..let me tell you a bit about me... I'm attractive(handsome and cute are what I'm told), 6' tall, 172lbs, athletic build, brown hair and eyes and love my body, very sexual and open to all sorts of kinks, open and honest, funny (at least I think so!), and generally worth getting to know.

I'm into hockey, football, hiking, biking, cooking, music, and movies. I'm intelligent and want to meet someone who will talk about anything and everything and will reply in complete sentences most of the time (I'll let it slide in the throes of passion when we're both about to cum together after a long session of dirty talk though...)

If you think you can handle all of this and I haven't scared you away, shoot me a message and we'll go from there.

Can we be each other's fun escape?

Of course, you must have a sense of humor. If you are good at ad lib, that will be awesome. Nothing will be scripted, there will be a general idea and we will just Wing it! 

I will play the Ted Cruz Part and you will play the Mrs Cruz part. It's all in good fun. All shots will be taken in public areas and I do encourage you to bring a friend as it is important that you are comfortable. We can discuss payment and credit markers.

Hi!

I'm not sure what it is about my life that has me yearning for conversation from time to time, but it is there and I am simply after conversation. I'm interested in people that can discuss anything - the price of fish in China, the latest presidential poll numbers, romance, hobbies, the temperature of the closest mountain top, sex, or whatever else. I'm not in a place where I can offer any kind of relationship, but that wouldn't stop me either, I suppose; so, you're relationship status is not a critical matter to me. As far as I'm concerned you could be single, married, divorced, have a boyfriend, have a girlfriend, or whatever, as long as we are able to discuss things openly and honestly it doesn't matter to me.

I am easy to get along with, but tend to be rather shy until I get to know someone a little. I tend to have trouble finding and meeting people, as I am not one to begin openly socializing. I enjoy many different things, I love to go and explore new surroundings, movies, dinners, traveling, hiking, spending time with friends, grabbing drinks with good people, anything outside, and anything adventurous or exciting. I would love to learn how to mountain climb! I am easy going and laid back. My interests are broad and varied. I am open to trying/doing new things. Most importantly, I would like to meet some new friends! So if I sound like someone you would get along with and would be interested in meeting, send me an email, tell me a little bit about yourself, and please include a picture so I have a face with the name.

I know Craigslist isn't the best place to meet people unless you're looking for serial killers, but I read through this section a lot so I figured I may as well post my own ad. Can't hurt, right? 

I met my best friend on here almost five years ago. Now we live really far away from each other and have sort of fallen apart recently. I miss the camaraderie that comes with being around someone who knows all your secrets - someone who knows you like the back of their own hand. I have some awesome friends, but they're all guys... and while I love them, it's nonetheless a lot of testosterone and none of them love the botanic gardens like I do. 

Anyway, I'm rambling. I'm 22, have my own place & car, and have two dogs and a cat. I love going out & doing things with my dogs - so if you have dogs, that'd be great! We go to Chatfield Dog Park a lot, or Elk Meadows in Evergreen when I have time. This summer I'd like to be outside a lot, so I hope you want to go hiking. 

I'm basically looking for someone who I can share everything with. Someone who's down for midnight drives to the mountains, concerts on a whim, all sorts of adventures, spontaneous road trips, sitting on the kitchen floor at three in the morning while we talk endlessly and do our nails. You know, that kind of cliché friendship I'm sure we all crave. I don't party, drink, smoke or do other drugs, and I've never been to a club or a bar (not that there's anything wrong with those things, I'm just lame), so if you're similar in that regard, I think we'd get along super well. :)

Is it just me, or does it prove increasingly difficult to make friends as adult who aren't flaky and can commit to making plans ahead of time? As I get older I realize I don't have the time or energy to constantly be the only person in the relationship putting in effort when it comes to spending time together. Therefore, if you're interested in making a new friend that actually wants to do things and won't blow you off at the last minute, let's talk!

I've never been the type of person to maintain a large circle of friends, but I would love to meet some new ladies around my age who want to do more than just exchange emails or texts. One of the biggest reasons my husband and I moved to Colorado was to be able to enjoy the outdoors, so I want to meet other people who like to be outside and want to go hiking or visit new places on a semi-regular basis. Don't get me wrong, we like watching movies and shows on Netflix as much as anybody, but if it's nice outside, I don't want to be inside all day. I live outside of Colorado Springs but I'm posting this in the Denver section in the hopes of meeting more like minded people, since I haven't had a ton of luck thus far. Maybe there are some women out there in Castle Rock or the southern suburbs who can relate.

I'm very sarcastic and stubborn, but I'm extremely loyal and I like to think I'm a pretty good friend to the few people in my life who seem to value our friendship as much as I do. I'm an honest person, and I have no time for BS. I'm looking for other women without kids, since I don't have any.

Other things about me:
- I am married but I'm not glued to my husband, which is why I'm posting this ad. Your status doesn't matter but if you are in a relationship/married maybe we can all get together at some point since it's nice to meet other couples too. 
- I have an awesome dog so if you like animals that's a plus. We adopted her over the summer and she loves trails, so she usually comes with us when we go hiking.
- I love hiking, am trying to get back into running and just enjoy being in a state that has a great climate for being outdoors pretty much all year round. I'm not the kind of person that's going to be camping in a tent or running marathons, but we do a lot of day hiking and I'm working myself back to running 5Ks since I like that distance. I like to be outside in the winter (I'm from the Northeast so the cold/snow don't bother me) but I'm not really into mountain sports. 
- I love baking, both for humans and my dog. Chances are if you have a dog and we ever go hiking together, I will bring your dog treats :)

If anything about this sounds familiar to you, feel free to shoot me an email so we can chat some more! I really hope there are some women out there who are in the same boat - there is too much cool stuff to do around here to sit inside and not get out and see it!

A Little about me:
I am a black woman, 40 years old, 5'7"", 150 pounds. I'm kinda girly--I paint my toenails and wear lip gloss for work and nice outings, but I also LOVE to put on a dingy T-shirt and raggedy baggy pants to hang out in the woods.

I love the outdoors scene--hiking, taking weekend road trips to places I've never been and camping is an ABSOLUTE MUST. I'd like to get my Jeep Wrangler (and German Shepherd puppies) this summer-- for now I have my car and my motorcycle to get me from point A to point B.

I have a few trips planned for this year: SCUBA diving in St. Lucia and Mexico--and if I could find a partner to road trip to the canyons in Arizona and the Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico that would be awesome. 

I absolutely love to discuss ideas, meaning that I am interested in intelligent conversation about life, but I also love to do silly things like putting on nothing but an over-sized t-shirt, blasting my stereo and dancing to music that makes me love the fact that I'm alive. Sometimes, instead of taking bites out of a Snickers bar and eating it like a ""normal"" person, I shove the whole thing in my mouth 'cause somehow it seems to taste soooo much better that way. After reading that you may not believe this next thing, but I do have a professional job and I'm very much looking forward to advancing in my work. 

What I am looking for:
It is very hard to describe all that I am attracted to in an introductory post. I am hoping that by you reading a little about who I am, you will have a good idea if you and I would be a good fit -- but I'll give you a glimpse of what I'm looking for here...

Intellectually, I'm looking for someone whose values (honesty, integrity, courage, intellect, communication and much more!!) parallel mine; someone who's strong in areas that are not my strength so that I may learn from him; someone who wants to be my friend and who wants to get to know me before we go further. I'd like to meet someone who intellectually challenges me as well as his own ideas. Age is not necessarily important to me (although I really can't see myself dating someone in their 20's), but maturity level is.

It goes without saying that I would like to meet someone whose face and body I enjoy looking at, but there is no way for me to be able to tell if I enjoy looking until we meet. All I can say here is that I am mostly attracted to mature-acting men (race does not matter) who are much taller than I (again, I am 5'7).

On a personal note:
I am single, I do not have any children nor do I want any. That's not to say I am not interested in anyone with children, I'm just saying that I am not interested in having any of my own.

I'm sure there are many other things you'd like to know, so please feel free to write, telling me about yourself and asking any questions you want to know about me.

Do you have a desire to feel more at ease with life, no matter what is going on?

Having your Bars run can do just that. There are 32 points on your head that correspond to things like; healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named.

They store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything.

For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called ""money.""

Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it, clearing the space for new awareness to come in.

The creative possibilities for your life begin to open up!

It's been said that at worst a Bars session will feel like a great massage. At best, it will change your life!

Having been involved in athletics and personal training for 30+ years,
I've achieved a lot of my personal targets around athletics and my body.
I've been stuck on the couch and shifted back into movement all the while thinking I don't have the time to exercise or eat right.

I've learned what really created the shifts for me to be able to achieve these targets I had for myself. It isn't the work or effort I put into it, it wasn't forcing discipline or faking that having patience was fine. It was a shift in how I was choosing to think. How I think about the target itself and how I think about the journey vs the end goal.

I can show you this, build a plan for you around your exercise, nutrition and the mindfulness habits to support and get you to your targets!

Would you be interested in a complimentary 30 minute discovery session to see what is possible for you, and if we can build this plan together to achieve your targets?

There is no obligation to hire me, and you will walk away with at least one tool you can employ right now to help you!

Having been involved in athletics and personal training for 30+ years,
I've achieved a lot of my personal targets around athletics and my body.
I've been stuck on the couch and shifted back into movement all the while thinking I don't have the time to exercise or eat right.

I've learned what really created the shifts for me to be able to achieve these targets I had for myself. It isn't the work or effort I put into it, it wasn't forcing discipline or faking that having patience was fine. It was a shift in how I was choosing to think. How I think about the target itself and how I think about the journey vs the end goal.

I can show you this, build a plan for you around your exercise, nutrition and the mindfulness habits to support and get you to your targets!

Would you be interested in a complimentary 30 minute discovery session to see what is possible for you, and if we can build this plan together to achieve your targets?

There is no obligation to hire me, and you will walk away with at least one tool you can employ right now to help you!

and I don't eat rhubarb. (never have ... never will)
Uh ... but seriously folk, my feet were never designed for walking. Unless it was somewhere in the shallow end of a swimming pool. Driving a car, keeping the beat to music, and stomping out roaches? Yes. That's their intended purposes. So Yes ! I am not into long walks. Especially not in the barrio at night. If you really want to know what I'm 'into', I'd have to say good 420, good conversations involving the esoteric, good chess games, and soytenly good music. OH. Did I say soytenly? Scuse. My accent hasn't disappeared altogether, yet. So here's a semi retired guy who has time on his hands. And even though science tells us that all time is simultaneous, I still have lots of it.

-- Too much of a grammar/literacy nerd to engage in a lot of abbreviating
-- Somewhat brainy (interested in books, current events, art, etc.)
-- At least minimally interested in sports (playing and watching)
-- Flirty, but in a mature, compelling way
-- Level-headed and non-stalkery
-- Interested in periodic emailing throughout the day

Bonus points for the following:

-- Love NPR
-- Enjoy coffee/tea

Hello,

I moved to town not too long ago in search of a lifestyle change. In the process I left all my friends and comfortable places behind. So now I'm looking for someone to go to bars, concerts and whatever else with. 

I get in to all different types of music, and even if it's not a genre or band I particularly like; I'd still go and give it a shot.

I also get into just walking around and talking, maybe from bar to bar? I guess what I'm saying is that I'm up for anything.

Hey there,
I am 47 and love getting to know poeple. The reason I am posting this is because I just like sharing things I normally wouldn't talk about. Talking with a woman who would do the same is exiting for me. I am a father and attached, and yes she knows about this little fetish of mine. She doesn't mind because 1. she trusts me 2. I have been a big part in helping her play out most of her little fetishes and desires. I like to talk about day to day things and joke around. I know this is a platonic section but just know although I am well rounded some of my subjects may involve sexual desires and experience. I am honest, non-judgmental, dominant, loving, stern, gentle, rough, creative, passionate and prefer women that are a princess in public but have a dark side. Although we will never meet I like to build friendships :)

So I find myself bored on this fine Saturday afternoon, I should be outside now that the sun is out, instead I'm here writing this ad seeking a friend.

I've tried this once without success, a friendship can't start on a bed of lies. All I want is honesty, is that hard to ask? I'm a pretty cool person though, but please lies are not a good way to start a friendship. I'm not looking to date, hence the whole friendship thing, but I figure opposites attract and wouldn't mind having a friend of the opposite sex.

I'm a really nice lady, I get along with just about anyone. I love music of all kinds, especially 80s one hit wonders, classical music and edm. My favorite artists consist of chromeo, matchbox 20, showtek, drake and avicii. My taste in music is all over the place, so random I know. I'm random though so it's okay. I love chick flicks and scary movies. I'm not a cat person, I enjoy long walks, conversations about almost anything and everything. I'm into current events, pop culture and history. So seriously we can discuss almost anything :)

I'm one hundred percent real, I can prove it to you, I wear socks that match and Broncos won the super bowl

My bf and I moved to Colorado a couple years ago and we would like to find some friends that we both have things in common with. We haven't seemed to meet many good friends in the area, so we decided to start looking. 

So far we love Denver and all of Colorado that we have been to so far! Some of the things we like are: Hanging out, watching movies, dancing, fishing, camping, motorcycles, road trips, playing pool, games, he is trying to learn a bit about photography, I am a very girly girl, I like getting my nails done, shopping and getting dressed up to go out.

He is an Air Force veteran who now works an odd work schedule out of state, and I am in the admin field We are both professionals, ddf (drug, drama free), and an every day average family! We are proffesionals, homeowners, but fun!

If you're around my age & you're posting in the strictly platonic section or reading through post, then chances are you're experiencing the same difficulties I am. Being an adult & making new friends to substitute for the ones lost to marriages, children, & careers can be quite difficult sometimes. Therefore, if you're like me, you've resorted to utilizing the internet in hopes of discovering like-minded individuals with similar interest, passions, views, & beliefs as yourself to develop new friendships with, & enjoy fun & intriguing activities & events with. 

I'm a nerdy, abstract, melodic & obscure atypical CO native with a passion for intricate & melodic music, art, & design with a career in technical support & an affinity for shirt ties & a dapper flair, with indie, punk & alternative roots. It's that expression of music, art, & design that overflows into my surrounding & around my home. I'm charming & can contribute my witty humor, intelligence & vibrant demeanor to any fun conversations of substance, but still reveal a glimpse into my profane side. And I always appreciate different perspectives & stimulating thoughts. 

On any given night, I can be found on the Boulevards among the cityscapes of downtowns, traversing main streets & city parks, listening to the sounds of old guitars & live melodies, indulging in cultured interest (museums, galleries, the theatre, etc.), or sipping cocktails at a hole-in-the-wall. Otherwise, find me near a good heat source, unwinding at home with a glass of vino (or other adult concoction) & a good movie or book, or while sketching, painting & listening to jams.

Maybe we can go to a burlesque & comedy show at Lanny's Clock Tower; see a play or movie, go to an art gallery or museum, do karaoke or trivia night at a pub, or catch a band & some live music. I'm always down to things that are outside of the box as well. 

Sometimes my good qualities are overlooked by the fact that I have a disability. Everyone has imperfections & obstacle to overcome, it's one of mine. To the right people it never seems to be an imperfection at all though. So, if you're interested & think we'd get along, shoot me a response.

Hello,

I'm a 32 year guy who has had a weird last few years, taking me out of my element, and putting me in a position of being more introverted than my normal self (I can explain all of this in detail in person). As I come out of this period in my life, I'm finding my social skills to be a little rusty, and I want to find someone to talk to, especially about dating. I haven't had any problems with dating, per se, but I feel I'm not seeing the results I'd like to lately, and would love to get some outside perspective.

A little about me: I own a small business, very physically active, love gardening & cooking, and overall a caring, open, and passionate person. Additionally, I live in Boulder. The reason I'm posting in the Denver group is because it's more active than the Boulder group, and feel I'll find more diverse perspectives here. Meeting in Denver would be easiest for me, though I meet in other areas that are conveniently accessed with public transportation, or via bicycle. 

On a final note: I've been told I'm a very good listener, and this wouldn't be a one-way street. If you need to talk about anything in your life, I'd love to listen and help.

I'll try my best to describe what I'd like, but I think the right person will understand. First of all, I""m not looking to meet. Where I am is not particularly relevant, but let's just say it's way too far for a meeting, even if I was interested. Basically, I'm looking for conversations that are outside our daily lives, the stuff you wouldn't normally voice out loud.

For the most part, I miss laughing. I had an on-line friend for about two years, and we used to have a lot of these weird conversations- and about our daily lives too- but I mostly miss those random, uninhibited thoughts that showed me who he really was. That's my take on it anyway- most of what we show the world on a daily basis is the version of ""us"" that is socially acceptable. I'd like to find someone who accepts me even if it doesn't always sound safe or sane. I'd like to do the same for you.

If you think this is for you, please feel free to introduce yourself, and include the same stats I've listed about myself in this ad. Oh, two things: 1) Please be a decent writer, who will write more than two sentences of ""text speak"". I will not respond to one- two line emails, or retarded questions like ""Are you real?""; 2) Please have time to write more than once in a blue moon. I think once a day is reasonable, given all the responsibilities we have at home and work. It could be more on some days, but if you expect frequent emails every day, I'm not the one.

Finally, please don't be offended if I don't respond. It's not personal, it's Craigslist. In any case, thank you for taking the time to read my ad.

Thought I would get a head start on this
Looking for someone interested in escaping the city to go enjoy the country this summer. 
I am thinking of some 3 day weekends, maybe a longer trip over July 4th
I go to the old family farm in Nebraska. Yes there is running water, indoor plumbing and a shower. You get your own room. This is a great place to get away from the big city. There is usually cell phone service and not far from a town
I have family I meet there every year, would just enjoy a companion to join me. Need a helper for some construction/repair projects. Might take some other trips also
You really don't need any money, everything is covered
If interested, just email me and I can fill you in more
Is always good to meet first

Hi people,

38 yo T-girl, I work from home late nights and I don't really get out much

Usually when I'm off work I like going fast, and when I spin I get pretty chatty

Problem is I tend to be awake when most everyone I know is asleep,

So basically looking for just fun friendly conversation, not nessicarily looking for anything sexual but if the chat ends up going that direction later on I won't really discourage it.

I'm a bit of a geeky artistic type, love to draw, paint, love classical music theater ballet that kind of stuff.

Not looking to meet up cause as I said I don't get out much (not a total shut in or anything just really more of a homebody)

Women, both cis and trans will go to the front of the line but guys, if you're cool I'll chat with you too

If I sound interesting, go ahead and respond to this ad or feel free to contact me on kik my name there is jessicarvn

This is probably a very weird post coming from a guy, But here it goes.
I am looking for a woman that wants to sleep with me once in a while. Sounds like all the other posts so far, Read on!
I am not talking about sex, I am talking about curling up next to me and sleeping through the night next to each other. 
I was married for 12 years and slept next to my wife, when I wasn't travelling, every night! After My divorce I dated a wonderful woman who would sleep with me almost every weekend. and even after we stopped dating, we are friends and she would sleep with me once or twice a month. She recently got engaged and feels she can not come for ""sleepovers"" any more and I respect her wishes. 


Lets do some friend stuff, grab a beer, go out for a nice dinner or order in and watch a movie, tell each other life stories, get to know each other and at the end of the night cuddle up and get some rest.

If you think maybe you would like an arrangement like this, are on the west side, and want a nice warm man to wrap his arms around you in bed, let me know. I tend to like smaller women, but I am not ruling anything out.

I am well educated, well read, well traveled, great conversationalist and great cook.
If you want to know more please email me.

There are so many people in this world. Sometimes when I'm driving or walking around Denver, I imagine what each person's story is. As simple as where their going, or sometimes deeper like their motivations, thoughts, and life aspirations.

I figured I'd throw an ad up here and hope to actually find that type of story. It'd be great to meet someone new, even if only to make it so there's one less stranger to wonder about.

Hello, new CL bestie!! I'm new to the 30's (just turned last month) and am looking for a kick-ass girl to get to know. I'm huge into music and would be awesome to find someone to attend some local shows with. Not your typical Coloradan, as in I don't get down with the 420 and I would mind if you do! Just not anything I care to partake in, and would appreciate the same. As far as drinking goes, have at it! Haha 

I love watching Netflix and chillin on the weekends, even a lot during the week. Going out ALL. THE. TIME. is just overrated and SO expensive. I like home-cooked dinner and watching tv, or just having great conversation and then grabbing some dessert and walking afterwards. I work a M-F job that I love and that allows me to have tons of fun (just bought a new car!!). 

Would be great to find a cute girl to go hang out and just have fun with. I'm all for if you're a healthy eater, as I would love to get in a little better shape (I mean, me being 'fat' is 6', 200 and running 3-4 miles a day! Haha) I'm an advocate of working out, but really don't care if you do. Would love someone that can go grab Mickie D's with me for dinner on a random Wednesday night! All in all, just looking for a fun girl that would enjoy the company of a fun guy! :) Someone that can and will talk about anything, from sex to movies to the idiocy of politics and religion (and if you're a fan of those, I'm very respectful and will value your opinions! :), and everything in between!!

Ask away with any questions you have, and please be a good conversationalist; nothing kills a friendship boner quicker than poor communication skills. Haha And I would like if you sent a photo, as I will do so in return. I hope you enjoyed my random novel, and have a great day! :D

Hi. I'm looking for a new friend. Yes, a platonic email pen pal -- but that sad little phrase makes it seem way too basic and cliché. It's really much more than that. Anything physical is off the table (and to be honest I don't really feel obligated to explain why right now). But who I am interested in connecting with, is the woman in the Starbucks line who took extra time that morning to dress nice, put on those boots she feels pretty and confident in, but then sighs and wonders why she bothered. Or the one who sits in the tub at night, drinking wine out of a coffee cup, who just finished sorting out all the kid runs for tomorrow, and the homework that's due, and amid the smell of lavender and make-up remover takes fifteen minutes to secretly hate the guts of her female unmarried friend who took that exotic vacation, and callously posted the pics on Facebook. We're not bitter people at our core, but we've battled through enough where some days a good ear to listen, a nap and a little agenda-less flirting sounds amazing. I'm actually a clean-cut, happy, hopeful and kind guy, non smoker, no drugs, no tattoos. I'm an attentive listener, I think I'm hilarious anyway. I'm basically just a dreamer/romantic who needs somewhere or someone for my musings and flirty words to land on. Maybe we can help each other. Talk with you soon, Scott

I am not looking to compete with anyone ( that's what happens with the guys ) just go and get sweaty with some company that I can rely upon to push me on those days when I don't really want to get out there and I will do the same for you.

Maybe I've spent to much time on the internet, but are there actually any women out there that are as wild about sex as the internet would make you believe? Women that want to explore D/s roles, mmf, mff, or are just kinky nymphos that want to explore well beyond run of the mill sexual encounters?

""The View""

You board the plane anxiously knowing that a forbidden friend bought you the ticket. As you pass the cockpit, you glance in seeing if this is all for real. I look back knowing you are there, our eyes catch each others for a brief moment. Butterflies enter your stomach as you continue to slowly make your way down the isle, waiting for everyone to stow their bags, wondering if anyone notices you don't have any. It was after all only two hours ago while you sat at your desk at work that you got the call to go to the airport for this mysterious flight. Still wearing your work clothes, you blend right in with the business class passengers. Short tight skirt, slightly open blouse exposing just enough to make the other men in the plane take quick glances in your direction. As you settle into your seat only knowing that the flight will eventually land in Las Vegas, not knowing how long you will be there or the reason for this mysterious flight, the flight attendants make their announcements. You barely hear what they say because you are lost in the nervous excitement. As the plane takes off, you start to panic, what the hell am I doing here?!? Just then the person next to you asks if you are traveling for business or pleasure. You pause as you contemplate the complicated answer, then only saying, ""a little bit of both."" You sit there nervously feeling like everyone knows you are here on a taboo meeting with a guy that only a few weeks ago responded to a silly little ad you placed on craigslist one horny morning. Right then you are interrupted again, this time by the co-pilot, you snap out of your daydream slightly startled. Excuse me miss, the captain asked me to have you come up to the flight deck. You quickly stand up, making the passengers in this post 9/11 world a bit nervous, as you walk to the front of the airplane. The door swings open as you arrive, and you notice the co-pilot did not follow you in. You look forward amazed at the beautiful sunset lighting up the whole flight deck. You look at me, our eyes locked again, this time there is no long pause as I say, ""I am glad you showed up tonight"" You say nothing and bend down to kiss me. Your tasty wet lips against mine as we embrace each other, locked together. I turn on the speaker so I can still hear the radio as I take off my headset and stand up to join you. My hands traveling down the small of your back then slowly up your blouse. I reach up and free your beautiful curvy breasts from the restraints they have been in all day. You gasp slightly at the forwardness of my actions since we were in such a public place, and we have never actually even met yet. 

I slide down, kissing your neck as I make my way down toward your now throbbing warm breasts. I can feel your breath as I lay my face against your chest, longingly running my tongue across your nipples. You put a finger under my chin and guide me up back to your face. ""My turn,"" you exclaim. You run your hands across my chest, pushing my tie to the side against the wings pinned to my shirt. Your hands continue down across my stomach, pulling my shirt out of my pants. You unbuckle my belt and slide your hand down into my dress slacks, where there is an ever increasing bulge forming. You gently stroke just two fingers along my now rock hard cock. Then suddenly you grab it tightly and squeeze showing me the force I am about to experience when I slide my cock into your tight waiting pussy.

I take you in my arms once again this time guiding your hands forward onto the dashboard of the airplane which leaves you straddled like you were being arrested. A thought flashes through your mind, can I be arrested for having sex in an airliner? At that moment I snap you back into reality once again as I quickly unzip the back of your tight skirt. I slide it down revealing the boy short panties below. I run my tongue down the small of your back, grabbing your panties with my teeth and pulling them down eventually letting them fall around your ankles. A quick slide of my finger confirms what I already know, your body is getting ready to take the hard cock still strangled in my pants. The sweet smell of your wetness comes across my nose as I lick the rest of your natural juices off my now hot wet finger.

This sends me over the edge, and I throw my pants down around my ankles near your panties. I guide my penis up and down the amazing curves your natural body has. Finally as the tip brushes against your waiting pussy lips I can take no more. With one complete thrust every inch of my cock slides effortlessly deep inside of you. You though your head back as you feel every fold of your vagina caress the shaft of my cock. I say ""no,"" keep looking forward. You tilt your head back down and feel a sudden rush as you see nothing but open sky and a fiery sunset ahead of you. Your mind has a hard time comprehending what your body is experiencing, you feel my cock sliding in and out of you as your mind believes you are flying free as a bird. Your body shudders as the first signs of your upcoming orgasm almost take you off of your feet. I wrap my arms around your waist supporting you as your head drops and an uncontrollable grunt comes out from deep inside of you. Your pussy tightens up and I feel your lips trying to strangle my cock with each pulse of your orgasm. Then I feel your body slack as you come down off of that euphoric high. I keep the pace going as my cock begs to be released into your hot willing body. I try to hold out, and when I think I can't hang on any longer I feel it again, your pussy pulsing cumming with another orgasm, this one making you loose your grip on the dashboard, and I catch you by the waist once more but this time you feel my hot load filling your pulsing pussy as I try my best to keep us upright. The strength of my orgasm causes my legs to give out and we collapse to the right, falling onto the co-pilots seat. We lay there holding each other trying to catch our breath together. 

You turn your head and kiss me again locking me lips and tongue into this crazy thing we just did. We look into each others eyes and just stare, neither one knowing quite how to recover and return to our reality, knowing full well that the passengers in the first class cabin most certainly heard what just happened. We get up, straightening our clothes, sharing another passionate kiss before I pick up the phone, and call my graciously waiting co-pilot. He returns to the flight deck, sliding close to your body trying to trade spots in the small space occupying the tip of this sex toy looking machine that gets people where they need to go. As he slides by you feel the tip of yet another penis, this one being held tight in the slacks of my co-pilot. Knowing my plan all along, he waited in the galley for us to have our secret little meeting. He admires your beautiful face, still flushed from our time together.

You walk back to your seat, feeling my love drip slowly out of you and into your now soaked panties. As you sit, you wonder if anyone knows what just happened, when suddenly the man sitting next to you says ""How was the view?"" 


Hope you liked my story, email me and when I get to know a bit about you I will write one for you ;) Trading stories or photos is always welcomed with excitement! I get turned on by all body types as long as you are as horny as me so don't be shy!

I'm posting this ad in the hopes of finding some new couples to spend time with, who aren't flaky and have the ability to commit to making plans ahead of time without always canceling at the last minute! I'm sure if you're taking the time to read this ad, you probably have friends like this - the kind who always complain about how they're bored and want to do stuff, but as soon as you propose doing something they're ""busy"" or ""can't go."" As you get older you realize you don't have the time or energy to constantly be the only side of the relationship putting in effort when it comes to spending time together. Therefore, if you are also a couple that wants to make new friends that are actually up for DOING things, let's talk! My husband and I live outside of Colorado Springs, but coming from the East Coast where it takes an hour to drive 15 miles on most days, driving doesn't bother either of us. Plus I figure that everyone here drives into the mountains throughout the year, so what's the difference in a one hour drive between the Springs and Denver suburbs if you have friends you want to spend time with?

One of the biggest reasons we moved to Colorado was to be able to enjoy the outdoors, so we want to meet other people who like to be outside and want to go hiking or visit new places on a semi-regular basis. We try to go hiking every weekend (though it's more low key now that it's colder), and I have a whole list of places I want to go in/around Colorado Springs and the rest of the state. Last summer we did a lot of hiking up off 70, climbed Quandary Peak and made our way out towards Aspen. We want to get down to the Sand Dunes and spend some time in Crested Butte this summer to see the wildflowers.

We have an awesome dog so if you like animals that's a plus. We adopted her over the summer and she loves trails, so she usually comes with us when we go hiking - unless of course it's somewhere dogs aren't allowed, we don't just bring her to be tools. Finding a couple with a dog that also wants to get out and explore would be great, but you don't have to have a dog as long as you don't hate them or something. 

My husband loves football, video/computer games (what dude doesn't?) and is in the process of getting his Masters degree. We both have hard science degrees, love to travel and do not smoke (anything). We don't have kids, and are looking for people in the same boat. 

If anything about this sounds familiar to you, feel free to shoot me an email so we can chat some more! I really hope there are some people out there who are in the same boat - there is too much cool stuff to do around here to sit inside and not get out and see it!

Hello! 

After some mild introspection I've realized I'm in a bit of a rut. Good job, nice house but nothing really exciting going on. I want to mix things up a bit and take a stranger out for a fun night in Blackhawk next week. I'm not much of a gambler but I do know enough to teach any willing party how to play Blackjack or Craps or Poker (happy to pay your way if it seems like you'd enjoy the game!). Or if you're an expert I am fantastic at hand signals and cryptic dialogue to take down the house. Really just looking for someone super fun to hang out with and enjoy some free drinks and conversation, and hey, maybe win a little money while we're at it!

I keep getting these free room vouchers in the mail (seriously, I have like 6 now, I don't know what to do with them all) so I thought I'd use two of them next Wednesday night (3/9). As this is in the ""strictly platonic"" section I did want to throw out there that you'd have a totally private free room to yourself (just try to keep the room service bill under a few grand ;). I'm pretty easy to get along with but it's a lot to ask a stranger to come up to Blackhawk for the evening so just wanted to make sure you know there's a safety net there in case we end up being incompatible people. 

If any of this sounds fun to you and you've got some free time next Wednesday night let me know. I'm not looking for any age in particular (older than 21, of course). I just turned 30 myself. Just someone up for a fun and different evening than the usual! Happy to send pics via email so you can make sure I'm not a gremlin beforehand. Hope to talk to you soon!

have to be crazy, and it doesn't have to be super mellow.
As long as we have good people around us that's what 
matters, that's what makes or breaks the experiences.....

Weather you like the green to slow down and mellow out,
the clear to get spun and go fast, or the white to just 
go a little crazy for the night, we don't care, and we don't judge.
We believe that everything is good in moderation, everything 
can be used to enhance your experience and your life. 

Send us a message, tell us a little about yourself,
your interests and your dislikes, tell us about the things
that make you, well you. We will respond to you, and if it seems
that this could be a friendship that enhances all our lives, we 
can progress like we should. 

We are NOT looking for hook ups ( though we can always hook you
up with your favorite party favors) We are NOT looking for pnp 
(although we are not opposed to it either. We are of a ""what happens
is what happens"" mindset.) We truly are just looking to add some
more good people to our lives, and we can't wait to meet you!!!!

Do you like coffee? We LOVE coffee. When your dragging a little and you need a pick me up, have some coffee. When you can't seem to get it in gear or go fasT, have some coffee. If you go Ice skating and you need to warm yourself up, have some coffee. Coffee is even a great thing to bring to a parTy to show your host that you appreciate them. 

It's always girls like chrisTina and crysTal who seem to like coffee the most, and that's just fine with us. 

We are a couple looking for other couples or individuals to join our Coffee Club. The membership fees are low, but you always get quality service. We have several locations through out the Denver area, and also are mobile for Coffee Club meetings. 

If you would be interested in signing up for our Coffee Club please send us an email and we will review your request and reply as soon as possible.

Hi, 
I'm looking for fun people to hike, bike, explore, and adventure with as the weather warms up.
As the title says, I'm 34 years old and I love to eat healthy and push on heavy things at 24 hour fitness. I'm a native and spring is my favorite season as I really don't like winter too much. I love being outdoors this time of year just as the days get a bit longer and the sun becomes a little warmer. My favorite day of the year is daylight savings when we get our extra hour of evening light. Love it!

I'm into indie rock/up beat/obscure types of music that give you goose bumps they're sooo good. I don't watch sports, or play video games, or smoke pot, or get super hammered any more but I have been known to bring a back pack full of beer on a hike or two. I used to like to tube Boulder creek quite a bit and think I'll be getting back up there this summer again. 
Also, my family has a super rad cabin just past boulder that I love to spend time at. No running water, or electricity, but it totally adds to the charm and there's a new mine I just discovered nearby.... I'm totally gonna (safely) spelunk it!
Also,
I love good food, and hitting up the Mayan or Esquire for a strange movie. Indian lunch buffets are awesome, hot springs rock, and estate sales are fun. I haven't been to the flea market in a couple years....I want to check out Eldorado Spgs. pool for the history of it and Bishops Castle for the sheer quirkiness! Definitely on my list.

If you're interested in getting to know a new partner in crime then shoot me a note! What do you do for fun?

Cheers!

Long story short, I was always one of those fat chicks who clearly didn't care enough about herself to put in any time or effort into her appearance. My mom was the same way and I have all male friends; I never really learned anything about how to dress, how to do hair, how to do makeup, etc. 

In the last year I've lost 80lbs and gone from obese to not. I currently weigh less than my lowest high school weight, and I'm wearing a pants size I haven't ever been able to wear.

I want to learn how to be more feminine. Dressing my body has always been about hiding it, now I'd like to learn how to put together cute outfits and accentuate my positive features. I've never worn makeup, so I watched some tutorials and bought some basic drugstore stuff. I still don't wear it because I worry a lot about looking like a clown. I don't have another woman around who would freely and honestly tell me where I could improve and it's making it very hard to judge how well I'm doing it. 

And the hair; I have 2+ feet of it that I don't know what to do with. I can french braid it, but usually it's just parted and pulled into a ponytail or nautilus bun because I just don't know how else to wear it. Everything I've tried from tutorials and such comes out looking wonky and I can't figure out why. 

I live a pretty frugal lifestyle and I'd like to try to learn these things on a budget. I tend to shop only at thrift stores and places like Ross, and I'll get occasional pieces from Target or wally world. My small makeup collection is mostly drugstore/low end. That doesn't mean I won't spend money when I believe it's worth it, but I'm highly interested in learning how a girly girl might shop sales or thrift stores. 

Other than that, I'm a married 26 year old with a humble occupation and no children. We have a place and cars and are otherwise stable and drama free. I recently discovered I'm really into nail polish and nail care (I'd love to do at-home manis or try different nail art techniques with someone, I have a lot of tools and supplies!) I play piano and violin poorly. When it warms up some, I'm hoping to start running with the C25K app. My husband and I spend our limited free time watching movies and Netflix (currently watching ST:DS9,) playing various PC games and (more recently) casually learning MtG. We are 420 friendly, but if you aren't I'm not pushy and don't mind being sober. I have a severe alcohol intolerance, so am unable to drink. 

I'm hoping to make friends with anyone in my general age range (trying to gauge how people my age dress and such) who are interested enough in clothes, makeup and/or hair to teach a stranger what they know. Let's get coffee and chat, maybe go shopping together sometime. Let's try out new and different things. If you even just want a text buddy that's ok too. 

Please put a favorite brand name in the subject line. Thanks much for reading.

I am looking for decent people who are knowledgeable about rockhounding and mining claims in colorado as well as know of good outdoor spots in general. I am a 28 year old father of two. Me, my wife and kids just moved here from portland oregon. I consider my self as a wellrounded and open minded individual. Would be nice to meet people who know the area and would like weekend adventures. Also looking at property and could use some insight. My sister and her wife are very chill as well as their friends.
About me... I love the outdoors. Camping, fishing, hiking, offroading, biking, rock hounding, etc. I enjoy a challenge and if something breaks I fix it. If I get an idea I will go with it (usually resulting in me building something). I dont care for big crowds. My goal is to buy some property (40 acres or more), get toys, have a garden, be self sustaining, make money doing things i love, etc.
What i would like to find in individuals... knowledge, loyalty, honesty, up for new things(not sexually), adventurous, open minded, goal oriented, follow through, etc.
side notes... i smoke (will be quiting), 420 sometimes, drink casual. If you do these things then thats your journey and if not then i will respectfully not do them around you if thats your wish. look forward to meeting some good friends and thanks for reading.

Hi I'm just a middle age (37) Wm that is in a rut at home that's been this way for years. We have agreed we are roommates but don't know how to get past that. Does anyone else have this situation too? Yes I have kids and don't want to leave them but can't stay this way forever either. Maybe I've lost my attractiveness? Idk. I still work out. Do women need that in a man too? I help with the house and the kids. That can't be it. Ugh. Anyon wanna talk?

I am a good looking senior with no friends or family locally. I live alone and am going to have back surgery in a month or so. I will not be able to drive and take care of myself for a few weeks. My immediate need is to find someone to take me to and from a couple outpatient procedures. The clinic will not let me drive home or be released to a taxicab.

I am looking for someone nearby who can help me with transportation to doctor appointments, to the hospital and back, errands, grocery shopping, light cooking, normal household chores and personal care until I get better. Any age range is OK as long as you can help me get to a standing position from a seated or lying down position and back again. I am willing to pay the going rate. At first it may be 24 hr per day until I see how independent I am. You may not have to be here if you live nearby and I can call you. I can supply references so you know who I am and can be trusted. I don't anticipate any medical needs other than pain meds.

Since I have no local friends, I am also looking to make some.

It would be nice if a friendship or friendships if you have interested friends, developed as I need to increase my social activities. I am educated BS/MS. I manage real estate property for a living. I own my own house and have a steady income. I am a friendly sociable guy with varied interests. I like to travel again when my back is fixed. I have found it impossible to date or do anything that involves exercise or standing in line because of my back. Otherwise in good health. I like movies and TV shows. I am handy at fixing things around the house. I like going out to eat at a variety of restaurants.

If this sounds interesting to you, please send me a reply and a phone number and we can meet and go from there. You can ask me anything by email, if you like.
Thanks,
Doug

Spring is nearly here and I'm looking to get out and have some fun with good people.
Honestly up for damn near anything.
BUT I would appreciate somebody who likes going out, having some drinks, and catching some live music.
I don't mean crowded and expensive amphitheater shows.
More like....dive bars.heh
I guess most of my favorite stuff would full under ""Rock"" but I'm not too fussed about genres.
I like all sorts of music.

Not just live music.
Also wouldn't mind somebody to just go out for coffee with,see movies, or just provide some company on a boring day!


Obviously I'd like to get to know you a bit first.
Email, maybe text, stuff like that.
Let's avoid a sudden and awkward first meetup, yeah?

Not really looking for any type of relationship but if one forms from a friendship then I'm open to seeing where things go.

I'm 25, work in the MMJ industry, and I'm very down to earth. I really enjoy the outdoors, hiking, working out and just being outside but I also a great night in, hanging out and smoking a bit(420 only) and enjoying a good beer. Movies and music are a big part of my life too so if you're down to hit up a venue for a show I'm your guy. I'm really just looking for someone with common interests who could use the benefit of a great friend as well. I know I'm missing out on a lot that Denver has to offer by not getting myself out there enough so here's to changing that!

I'm also down to just sit and talk as long as no BSing is involved. I'm not really sure what we'd do together, but I'm up for almost anything as long as it's strictly platonic.

Hi There,

I'm a sweet, sane, average guy in the south metro area looking for a friend (or more ) to spend some time with. looking for a woman of any age, but preferably close to my age or older so we might have a little more in common. Looks mean nothing to me, a nice person with a kind heart does.
The trade you ask?... I came out here for a couple weeks for work and the job got finished early.
I have a flight on Friday back home. Until then, I'm offering myself as basically a slave in exchange for a place to stay until then. I can do handyman stuff, help around the house, or anything you might need, literally anything ( yes, even windows...lol). Imagine... Your own personal slave, and a cool guy too. very few things are off the table as far as what I will do for you. Even if I need to stay in a garage or shed, you have someone that will do ANYTHING you want. My company only covers me on the days I work, and I kind of overspent my per diem. Basically, if you help me out for a couple nights, I'll help you.
Think about it, let me know, and have an awesome day.

You'd like a momentary diversion, even if it's just an occasional coffee for 30 minutes.

You Get Bonus Points: If you're the intellectual type, a little geeky, perhaps even a little shy, you get extra credit. If you have long hair, you get an automatic 'A'.

Me: I'm intelligent and an extrovert. I'm witty, occasionally silly, but always funny. I'm professional, mature, and stable. I'm 6 foot 3 and height/weight proportionate. 40 years old, but often get told I look younger. I'm told that I'm cute, but I'll let you decide that for yourself.

Next: Send me a note and we'll see what happens from there. If we connect, great. If not, there's no harm done. I am looking for someone to connect with on an intellectual and charismatic level and am not looking for a hookup. I am immensely discreet and you should be, too. Take a chance and re-discover yourself. So I know you're not a spam bot, put your hair color in the subject line.

Anyone out there want to send filthy emails back and forth? Yes, I know, this is the platonic section so let me explain. This will not go past email. We will never meet, we will never actually see each other. That being said, I do want this to be ongoing. I want us to learn how to push the others buttons, really explore what they like no matter how ""taboo or frowned upon"" they may be. I don't care about your marital status, I only ask that you be over 18 and not take 5 days to respond. This is a place to explore our fantasies together that is completely free from judgement and with zero risk of catching anything or actually cheating! Today you can be a shy housewife with a passion for delivery guys and tomorrow you can be the CEO of your own company with a flock of men who meet all of your needs. I am aware that this is not for everyone, but it's for a very specific someone. Someone who writes in complete sentences, has a vivid imagination and has a bit of a filthy mind. So, hit me up and lets dialog!

I'm a single, mature, DDF, potsmoking introvert who's just moved here from the east coast to build my new life.

This, of course, is a heroic undertaking- and I'm doing a great job of making a place for myself. I have my own apartment, located close to downtown. I work hard and do well. I take care of my friends and family... What I don't do is get out and socialize. I don't play the ""new friend I met over drinks"" game. I like to work hard, and I prefer to spend my tips on cooking great food and smoking good herb... But that makes it hard when ""human nature"" rears its thirsty head. I want a woman in my life. I just don't want to be your boyfriend/husband until I really have my shit together. But in the meantime, there's got to be a woman who wants to share time with someone interested in success and challenging himself to improve and evolve!

I don't want to sound like a creeper, but I'm very interested to be in a friendship that walks the line of platonic and ""friendship with benefits"". I think we should talk about what I mean specifically once we engage in private email correspondence.

I'm really chill about this. I have thought it through and I definitely want to encourage you to respond with any questions or concerns. Let's get philosophical and ask why I'd even do this. I'm an open book with a desire to keep things respectful and dignified and with the intent of making us both benefit from this arrangement.

Hi. My name is Kalia, I'm 23, and I have agoraphobia.

What that means, practically, is that I have a hard time leaving my home. It makes it pretty difficult to meet people, as you can probably guess.

Commonly asked questions: No, I don't work. Yes, I get my groceries delivered. No, staying at home is not ""relaxing and fun"". Yes, it's very lonely. No, I didn't make a decision to live this way, I have a condition that requires it. Yes, I'm working very hard towards my recovery.

I'm looking for a friend. Someone who will like me and spend time with me in spite of my limitations. I have trouble leaving my home, but otherwise I'm a normal person. I like action movies and comedy specials. I'm a huge nerd. I love comic books and superheroes, as well as magic and fantasy. I play a lot of video games, especially RPGs like Skyrim and Fallout. I read fanfiction. I'm into Game of Thrones and Harry Potter, Arrow and The Flash. My favorite cartoon is Steven Universe.

I want to meet someone who will bring over blankets and pillows for a movie marathon, or help me try a new recipe for the first time, or go for long walks around the neighborhood.

I have a lot of free time on my hands, and I'd like to spend some of it with a new friend.

So... I'm gonna take a chance, roll the dice, maybe make a buddy.

My name is Reese, I'm a 24 year old transmasculine guy living currently in the Denver metro area. I identify as a transguy (ftm) and I'm looking for texting buddies, since I work a lot and currently in between housing. I'm not looking for hook ups, friends with benefits, or anything like that. If we wind up do clicking to meet in public (which has rarely happened, not because I enjoy being anonymous, I have social awkwardness that leads to social anxiety), please understand I will wind up being silent a lot of the times, as I'm very shy. Now that is out of the way, let me spill about my positive attributes...

I'm an aspiring chef (with a current title of dishwasher, but I have a lot of recipe ideas, just no real way for me to create them given my situation. I really enjoy watching the Food Network (Chopped especially), and when I can, the Create channel on basic cable. I'm partnered with an amazing guy who is very important to me. I love beer but I don't drink it to excess, in fact, I prefer cooking with it. I'm a bit of a geek as well, I am a major fanboy of Doctor Who, which I can quite passionately talk about if given half a chance. I do enjoy reading but however, I rarely find time to because of the chaos I have been thrusted in. I do write a bit, usually while listening to some form of music that inspires a scene in my head (Last of the Wilds by Nightwish has recently inspired something just not sure what yet as the scene has yet to be written).

What I'm looking for... well that is quite a mixed bag. I'm looking for someone who would understand that I am very... awkward in person, someone who would tolerate texting some random guy who is quirky yet generous, human but a mystery. I am mostly seeking some sort of companionship but from a distance. If you are that person, feel free to reply to this ad, however to weed out those pesky robots who phish for people to join their websites and such, I ask that in the subject line, you put your top beer and food combos (Beyond beer and pizza, or beer and burgers).

Do you have a desire to feel more at ease with life, no matter what is going on?

Having your Bars run can do just that. There are 32 points on your head that correspond to things like; healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named.

They store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything.

For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called ""money.""

Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it, clearing the space for new awareness to come in.

The creative possibilities for your life begin to open up!

It's been said that at worst a Bars session will feel like a great massage. At best, it will change your life!

Are you interested in seeing what a 60 or 90 minute Bars session can do for you?

Hey!

I am ready for a change in my life, and I'm thinking about moving to the Denver area. Right now, I live in Kansas City, and I really want to live in a more liberal/progressive part of the country, and I have been to Denver enough to know that ""in general"" Denver and Colorado match my morals a lot more than Kansas City & either Kansas or Missouri.

About me: I am a single, 29 y/o straight man coming from a mixed family background (My mum is Catholic; My father is Jewish). I am an extremely polite, nice, kind, person. Politically, I am definitely left of center (If you are even contemplating voting for Trump you can disregard this message; we wouldn't get along!) I love sports, and would be really excited to live close to the Rapids & an NBA team in particular. 

Right now, I am working PT at a furniture/home goods store that has several branches in the Denver area, so between 1 of these stores it would be probably easy for me to get a few hours a week to just get started, but I am wanting to change my employment situation.

I am going to get certified to ref soccer in March here in KC, and this will transfer with me to Colorado so I can ref soccer matches. I have a college degree in Recreation & Tourism Management, and I previously worked for the Philadelphia Eagles so I would be interested in getting involved with the Rapids, Nuggets, or one of the sports arenas.

Lastly, I am 420 friendly. As a former basketball player who has had 3 major knee surgeries, I do believe in the medicinal benefits of it for pain/arthritis. Once a resident of Colorado, I would be interested in getting my Med Badge and pursuing work opportunities in the MMJ industry. I do NOT need to smoke inside (although it would be nice) but like I said, I am a smoker so living with people that at least are morally OK with this is probably necessary.

That's me! I am looking for people to live with! New friends! I might only be working PT at first, but I have the financial ability to pay several months in advance with a security deposit, and I really need a ""home base"" as I pursue all these options I discussed.

Thanks for taking the time to read this post, and if I sound like I might be a fit for your home, or you know of someone who might be, I'd love to hear from you! Even if this is a temporary 1-4 month thing while I get settled and then find a different more permanent place to live, this could work too!

KC is not that far from Denver (I've been to Denver and Colorado a lot) so if anyone is interested in meeting me face to face it is no problem for me to drive out and meet people!

Hope to hear from some nice people! :-D

Cheers.

I have tix to Joe Satriani. The show is March 7 @ 8PM at the Paramount in Denver.

I bought the tickets a while back and the show snuck up on me. 

I'm married, my wife is not a fan of this kind of music, seems like my friends are busy or they aren't fans. 

So, I'm sincerely not looking for anything but a fan who might enjoy the show. Maybe we can have a bite to eat out somewhere before the show. I live N of Denver and don't get to explore it as much now as I used to.

Yep, just over 50 so I'm slowing down a tad. Like to cycle, hike and be outside like most CO folks. My musical tastes are all over the board. Big Zeppelin fan but have tickets to the Dead this summer too... Just for grins. Know of a place that has great pastry or a great appetizer? Maybe some local art on the wall...

Willing to chat or meet up this week for coffee or whatever to put anyone at ease. 

Anyway I'm rambling... If something piques your curiosity please do say Hi.

My boyfriend and I just moved here from Florida. I love it here so far, but I know about two people outside of work. All we need now are some like minded individuals to geek out together. 

STOP NOW if you are looking for anything other than friendship. I do not want naughty photos. Not looking for a hookup or anything of the kind. If you are planning on emailing me asking for 'noods' please just forget this post or I exist. Ok now that that is covered back to the actual post lol

We have pets so would prefer if you weren't allergic as we are always covered in pet hair of all kinds.

We are BIG time gamers. I collect consoles, but my boyfriend is a PC gamer. Also love us some boardgames! Would be great to meet someone who loves boardgames, so we could set up game nights. We do not play your typical boardgames though. No monopoly! Warning: he is a sore winner/loser. Don't play with us if you can't handle A LOT of shit talking and competition.

I am a crafter. Mainly I cross stitch for my Etsy shop. I am learning to knit and crochet. I sew, but it is mostly liners for my chinchilla cage lol. I want to try more hobbies, and have a shopping buddy for the craft shop. Be prepared to spend hours in there if we go. 

I bake! Food is a passion. I love to bake and cook. I eat meat, but I don't care if you don't. 

As for reading, films, and such. I love scifi! I read mainly science fiction. I watch The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Girls, Once Upon a Time, Bojack Horseman, The 100, Orange is the New Black, etc. I love Battlestar Galactica and Firefly. I will watch almost any movie or show except I HATE ALL THINGS TWILIGHT AND FIFTY SHADES. Favourite movies: Star Wars, Stardust, Hitchhiker's Guide. I love anime! And I am Studio Ghibli obsessed! 

Please never use the words: Bae, Turnt, Thot, or Fleek. They are not real words. I don't mind if your spelling sucks or even grammar. Use all the short hand typing your want or we can have a conversation in emojis lol just not those words.

I work part time so I have A LOT of free time.

I curse like a sailor. If swearing bothers you I can try to watch my language, but you have been warned. My favourite word is the 'F word' which I say countless times throughout the day. I smoke like a chimney especially if I am drinking. I don't drink often. We are 420 friendly. 

I have a few disorders I try not to let get in the way of my day. If you were understanding when I have 'bad days' or 'episodes' that would be super! I have anxiety, depression, OCD, and mild agoraphobia.

My boyfriend and I are crazy immature. So, we would prefer friends in the 21-30 age bracket. Unless you are also immature then 'age ain't nothing but a number.' We do not have kids. I do not mind kids they just aren't for me. I lack the maternal instinct (no it will not come with time and I will not change my mind so please don't say this to me). I am crazy awkward around children. So, if you have kids I don't mind just don't be offended when I get weird around them because I really have no idea how to act. 

I do not care what your sexual orientation, skin colour, religion, or political stand is (unless you're a trump supporter. If you are again forget I exist). But if that stuff matters to you here are my stances on them: I am bi, white, agnostic (raised baptist), independent (Sanders supporter), pro-choice, etc. 


So, now that I have written a novel haha if you think we could be friends send me a message.

I'm a senior in college and have decided on my senior project. What I would like to do is photograph average, everyday women to try and prove everyone is beautiful on the outside.

Last semester I watched a video in class about how people use photoshop to create unrealistic pictures of women for advertising. I already knew everyone does this, but the outrage and hurt from the women in my class really stuck with me. This is for them, and for everyone else, who has ever felt ashamed of themselves.

What I'd like to do is find as many women as I can, all age ranges, all body types, all skin tones, and photograph them. With the right lense, lighting, angle, background, etc, I can prove anyone can be a model.

I would like to do fully clothed, partially clothed, and semi nude, that choice is totally up to you. I can also make sure your face is obscured. And of course, you will get a copy of every picture I take.

If you'd like a free photo shoot, to feel like a goddess, to help me complete my project and to give those fake models a big middle finger, I'd love to talk to you. Thank you.

We both love anime and go to San Diego Comic Con every year. We also workout and go hiking and biking often. We are not religious and people who are make us uncomfortable.
About Us:
30 year old female and 29 year old male, avid anime lovers(ask us about our figurine collection!), dog lovers (we have 3), happily married for 8 years, I'm quiet at first and takes me a little while to become comfortable with other people (never sure whats okay to say to other people, I'm very sarcastic and I think I'm hilarious (I'm often told I'm a little too mean)). He is very outgoing and loves bringing people together. We do not drink, smoke or do any drugs what so ever and would prefer friends who is the same, I am obsessed with makeup and frequent Sephora and Ulta on a semi-regular basis. I enjoy going shopping and it has been a while since I've been able to have a girls shopping trip (malls, shopping centers, yardsales, second hand stores, etc) and hubby is getting tired of being draggged along. We do not have children and am still not really comfortable around children yet ( I have no motherly instinct and borderline on being emotionally dead). I love cooking, baking and looking for and trying new recipes. We collect art from different comic conventions and are slightly obsessed with the Nightmare Before Christmas.
My favorite T.V shows are Charmed, Big Bang Theory, 2 Broke Girls, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Our taste in music is very random (country, Jpop, Rock, classic rock, 80's music, mowtown, etc) I think that should do it for now.

I enjoy going shopping and it has been a while since I've been able to have a girls shopping trip (malls, shopping centers, yardsales, second hand stores, etc). I do not have children and am still not really comfortable around children yet ( I have no motherly instinct and borderline on being emotionally dead). I love cooking, baking and looking for and trying new recipes, I collect art from different comic conventions and am slightly obsessed with the Nightmare Before Christmas.
My favorite T.V shows are Charmed, Big Bang Theory, 2 Broke Girls, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. My taste in music is very random (country, Jpop, Rock, classic rock, 80's music, mowtown, etc) I think that should do it for now. 
If I seem interesting, feel free to email me.

Do you need to be spanked or just like the idea? 

Would being held accountable motivate you to work harder on your personal goals, classes, traffic violations, over spending, attitude, general behavior, or some other problem? 

Nothing tells a woman to straighten up like a spanking.

For fun or discipline. Try it once, meet occasionally, or regularly like once a week.

I'm a photographer, somewhere between amateur and professional, who is looking for a woman to take photos of. Please do not feel you have to look like a model--if you do, that's fine, but I'm not necessarily interested in that. Age, race, height, weight etc. are not important to me either (though please be over 18).

I'm more interested in art than portraiture, and I'm especially looking for faces that are interesting to me in some way--if you can convey a sense of playfulness or a sense of mystery, that's more of what I'm looking for. I am NOT interested in taking nude photos, or doing boudoir shoots. I'm just looking to take photos of you in whatever clothes you like in a location that in some way reflects your personality. Fully-clothed can include costumes if you wish, if you feel a costume would bring out your essence. 

If you are interested, please send a photo or two that includes your face. I'm posting this in ""Strictly Platonic"" because I'm not thinking of this as a business transaction, but a friendship of sorts. If we work well together and it works out for both of us, I may want to take some additional photos when the mood strikes either of us. Of course you can have copies of any or all of the photos to use however you like.

1. It could cure you random bouts of boredom 
2. You could laugh so hard you pee your pants ( not certain that's a pro)
3. You could have someone to bounce ideas off of such as should I switch jobs? Should I get a cat? Should I wear underwear today? Just to name a few 
4. You would have someone to flirt with ( I'm not very good at it, you probably won't even know I'm doing it!)
5. You would have someone to vent to, ex... Maybe you had too much to drink at the office Christmas party and secretly made out with your girlfriend and she ended up telling everyone ( not judging) or maybe you got home from the salon and your husband/boyfriend didn't notice your hair! In either case I would respond with a snappy and disbelieved ""ohh noo he/she didn't!"" And proceed with an intense conversation of how your friends are ugly and suck!
6. I'm from Iowa so know worries that your going to fall in love with my charming and witty banter and leave your spouse for me
7. I'm hot ( hey who doesn't want to talk to someone that's hot!)

Cons:
Yeah, I got nothing here

Hey there,

IDK why I'm doing this. On one hand I'm pretty done with the whole relationship thing, cause it always ends with pain. In other words I've kind lost hope. But on the other hand I have this stupid primal/biological desire for intimacy. It sucks even though my mind is telling me no my heart says yes. Its not that I have high standards but, specific standards. I just want some one normal, human, exciting. Some one that has there ups and downs but for reasonable reasons. Someone who can be eccentric about certain things and can back it up. I guess I just want someone with a good head on their shoulders. That to me is what is sexy.

So anyways if you just wanna hangout and chat, maybe hop in my hottub, or come up with some crazy adventurous date then email me. Pleas include a picture. I get it we all suck at taking pictures, just do the best you can.

I have an opportunity I would like to offer to a female in her mid-50s/early 60s but there's a problem with putting this under ""jobs"" -- I really need someone who is a friend, or at least friendly, first and foremost. We have to talk and get to know each other -- sorry! Haha, that's just how it is. Yes, I do have a real-life female friend but she lives in another state. I need somebody who lives closer than that. This can and will definitely lead to a business or job opportunity (not to mention adventure and fun). 

So: You should be a smart, personable gal in her 50s/60s. You should be friendly and open to being friends with somebody like me. What kind of person am I? I'm not a guy! I have lots of different interests. I need one or possibly two people to do as-needed type work with pay dependent on skill and commitment level. Having some computer smarts and an internet connection, as well as a land line and your own transportation, will definitely help, but are not strictly necessary. A car and a driver's license will be needed, however. 

Otherwise, you'll find out when you answer the ad. (NOT looking for a hookup, dates, etc. Please do not reply if that is your interest. Also I am not interested in investing in YOUR business or buying insurance from you, or anything of that nature.) 

Hope to hear from you soon!

------

PS, let me reiterate that this I'm not looking for sex. If that's your interest, please move on. 

If you are broke and/or need a place to live, it's ok to reply to this ad. I've been in the same boat myself and I will help you out if I can. I will at least listen. I used to work in the mental health system so I might be able to help you find resources if nothing else.

Mature couple looking for friendship and fun and also same room sex, maybe touching each other if all agree. ..PS female is straight. we live in the SE area of aurora around iliff & tower. Its been a while since we've met anyone that we can really call a real friend and now we are finally beginning to look. we are fairly active and fit especially in the summer but winter time is hard. A few of our interests are going out to dinner, watching movies and games can usually be a lot of fun. We like fires and hot tubs, and shooting pool. Brad loves to ski and jane would like to learn. this sounds terrible so far but in the warmer months...Apr.-Oct. we belong to a pvt lake 60 mi E of aurora where we spend a good share of our time up there. we have a 21 ft boat and a 5th wheel and are really looking for our friends to come up and join us. so I guess we're looking for people that enjoy boating as we spend our time wakeboarding,waterskiing, wakesurfing, tubing you name it! In the evening a fire or just watch movies and it's nice taking the boat out at night as well. we are looking for fun outgoing respectful couples that just want to have fun and hopefully end up with a true friendship. we are not drinkers..we do smoke but plan on quiting soon and brad will smoke weed once in a while for medical reasons. we are young at heart,mind, body and retired, with a lot of free time. so if this stupid add interests you please give us a shout out. you have nothing to lose and maybe we will end up with a good friendship. Any age is fine..it's only a number and please send us a pic or two so we can see who were talking with.Have a great day..peace out..PS as far as the hot tub suits are optional,how ever if you were uncomfortable without one we would wear one not to be offensive.

So all I've receive this far is fake responses. Not sure what there are people pretending to be someone else. That's just weird. Or from women who don't take care of themselves.

In the past I had contemplated posting something like this several times. I don't know what's actually pushing me to finally do it but here I am.

I'm sure my story is no different than many others. A man gets married and after several years of marriage he finds himself neglected, alone. I think perhaps the difference in my case is the amount of effort I've put into that marriage to see some sort of change. I've tried for years. I've took every piece of advice given to me by professionals and yet I still found myself ignored and often times feeling as though I was taken forgranted. At this point, newly single, I just need a fun and passionate connection. Someone I can share with, vent to, laugh with, and enjoy.

Just as my description says I'm an attractive man, 30, 6 foot, and take good care of myself. I would like to connect with a woman who is in a similar situation, someone as equally frustrated and just wants some fun. Beyond the connection I'm not sure what else I'm looking for but I'm sure that if there is a deep connection we can figure that out.

Yes I'm very real. It's a nice day out. I've no idea what kind of interesting replies this posting will receive, if any, but I'm excited for the chance that there just might be someone out there who feels the way I do and is ready to build a connection.

I'm posting this ad in the hopes of finding some new couples to spend time with, who aren't flaky and have the ability to commit to making plans ahead of time. I'm sure if you're taking the time to read this ad, you probably have friends like this - the kind who always complain about how they're bored and want to do stuff, but as soon as you propose doing something you get radio silence. Therefore, if you are also a couple that wants to make new friends that are actually up for DOING things, let's talk! I'm posting this in the Denver section because even though we live outside of Colorado Springs, coming from the East Coast where it takes an hour to drive 15 miles on most days, driving doesn't bother either of us. We just drove an hour to go to a hiking trail in Woodland Park last weekend, so if you live in Castle Rock or the south suburbs, we aren't all that far apart.

One of the biggest reasons we moved to Colorado was to be able to enjoy the outdoors, so we want to meet other people who like to be outside and want to go hiking or visit new places on a semi-regular basis. We're not going camping in the woods for days at a time or anything but when it's nice out, we are not sitting inside all day. Basically, it would be great to find other couples who are interested in stuff like having a backyard BBQ or taking a longer drive to a nice hiking spot to get away from the more popular places. We have an awesome dog so she usually comes with us when we go hiking. Finding a couple with a dog that also wants to get out and explore would be great, but you don't have to have a dog as long as you don't hate them or something. 

My husband loves football, video/computer games (what dude doesn't?) and is in the process of getting his Masters degree. We both have hard science degrees, love to travel and do not smoke anything so we aren't looking for smoking buddies. We don't have kids, and are looking for people in the same boat. 

If anything about this sounds familiar to you, feel free to shoot me an email so we can chat some more! I really hope there are some people out there who are in the same boat - there is too much cool stuff to do around here to sit inside and not get out and see it!

OK, I definitely posted this in the wrong place yesterday. The m4w in casual encounters has some of the most vulgar references to the fairer sex I have ever seen. (Does that shit really work???) I am NOT looking for a hookup TODAY! I will delete any response asking to meet today. We may or may never meet. That will be determined by how well we like each other after chatting fer a bit.

I think everyone needs a friend and confidant sometimes. Someone to see and accept them just as they are. To provide daily inspiration, encouragement, and empowerment. Or maybe, just to listen without judgement. Whether you simply need someone you can trust and talk to or you desire honest feedback, I'm here.

When everything else seems tough, and no one else seems to understand, I'm your soft place to land.

There is no charge for this. Just hoping to be a friend to someone who needs one and a conduit for abundant love and kindness :)

Do you have a desire to feel more at ease with life, no matter what is going on?

Having your Bars run can do just that. There are 32 points on your head that correspond to things like; healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named.

They store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything.

For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called ""money.""

Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it, clearing the space for new awareness to come in.

The creative possibilities for your life begin to open up!

It's been said that at worst a Bars session will feel like a great massage. At best, it will change your life!

So I am giving this a shot, let's see where it goes. The title pretty much says it all. I would like to find a good friend who would be open to being intimate later on. I moved to CO last June from NC. Haven't had the best of luck relationship wise so I want to take a break from the whole dating scene in general. I go to school full time and nanny part time. It would be great to find someone that lived near me. Honesty is always appreciated. If we did become intimate I would like to know if you do sleep with someone else. Our friendship can continue but the sexual relationship will have to stop. I am not discriminate of age or race. Just looking for a friend I can go out with on occasion, cuddle and watch movies/Netflix with, play board games with, make dinner with and just have someone to talk to.

About me: I am 32 years old. Former Marine. Associate Degree in Early Childhood Education. Working on a degree in Solar Energy Technology. I have an 8 year old boxer.

Thanks for taking time to read this. If you want to message me please send a recent picture with your message. Otherwise I will not respond. I'm real, life is too short for BS.

It has been a longtime dream of mine to see the girl I love again in heaven. I wish to share my first kiss with her, and escape the bullying and torment I have suffered here on Earth. Recently, the cruel behavior of others has shown me that no matter how hard I try to be a good person. No matter how kind or helpful I am with others, that I will always be viewed as nothing more than something I am not. 

But if I go to heaven soon, then I can see my love. Someone who actually cares about me, someone I can watch movies with, and start over with in the next life.

I am not looking for anyone to help assist me with suicide. I simply need help talking.

Is it just me, or does it prove increasingly difficult to make friends as adult who aren't flaky and can commit to making plans ahead of time? As I get older I realize I don't have the time or energy to constantly be the only person in the relationship putting in effort when it comes to spending time together. Therefore, if you're interested in making a new friend that actually wants to do things and won't blow you off at the last minute, let's talk!

I've never been the type of person to maintain a large circle of friends, but I would love to meet some new ladies around my age who want to do more than just exchange emails or texts. One of the biggest reasons my husband and I moved to Colorado was to be able to enjoy the outdoors, so I want to meet other people who like to be outside and want to go hiking or visit new places on a semi-regular basis. Don't get me wrong, we like watching movies and shows on Netflix as much as anybody, but if it's nice outside, I don't want to be inside all day. I live outside of Colorado Springs but I'm posting this in the Denver section in the hopes of meeting more like minded people, since I haven't had a ton of luck thus far. Maybe there are some women out there in Castle Rock or the southern suburbs who can relate.

I'm very sarcastic and stubborn, but I'm extremely loyal and I like to think I'm a pretty good friend to the few people in my life who seem to value our friendship as much as I do. I'm an honest person, and I have no time for BS. I'm looking for other women without kids, since I don't have any.

Other things about me:
- I am married but I'm not glued to my husband, which is why I'm posting this ad. Your status doesn't matter but if you are in a relationship/married maybe we can all get together at some point since it's nice to meet other couples too. 
- I have an awesome dog so if you like animals that's a plus. We adopted her over the summer and she loves trails, so she usually comes with us when we go hiking.
- I love hiking, am trying to get back into running and just enjoy being in a state that has a great climate for being outdoors pretty much all year round. I'm not the kind of person that's going to be camping in a tent or running marathons, but we do a lot of day hiking and I'm working myself back to running 5Ks since I like that distance. I like to be outside in the winter (I'm from the Northeast so the cold/snow don't bother me) but I'm not really into mountain sports. 
- I love baking, both for humans and my dog. Chances are if you have a dog and we ever go hiking together, I will bring your dog treats :)

If anything about this sounds familiar to you, feel free to shoot me an email so we can chat some more! I really hope there are some women out there who are in the same boat - there is too much cool stuff to do around here to sit inside and not get out and see it!

I enjoy 420, breweries, comedy, exercise, live music, and would even be up to try something completely outside of my comfort zone. I'll be staying at the Comfort Inn Central. I'm thinking about moving to Denver and I can't imagine a better way to get to know the city than to take someone out for a casual date, or try something wild. Please write me ASAP if you're at all interested and feel free to ask me any questions. It would be great to make a new friend, or just have a fun affair for the weekend.

Do you have a desire to feel more at ease with life, no matter what is going on?

Having your Bars run can do just that. There are 32 points on your head that correspond to things like; healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named.

They store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything.

For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called ""money.""

Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it, clearing the space for new awareness to come in.

The creative possibilities for your life begin to open up!

It's been said that at worst a Bars session will feel like a great massage. At best, it will change your life!

Hello!

I'll spare you the long version of my story -- until you ask -- but let's just say that for reasons related to my marriage and my divorce, I find myself nearly completely disconnected from the world. I also find my faith waning. I have a couple of good guy friends, but they're married and otherwise occupied most of the time.

I don't really know why I am searching for a woman to buddy up with me for church friend-dates on Saturday. I CAN promise you that I am NOT interested in a physical or romantic relationship. I want a real friend, like I haven't had since I was about twenty-one. I miss sitting in front of one other person, sharing all my bull-s%&t and not being judged. I miss causing myself shame (not really) but having a friend to sit across from me, listen to my story, and share an empathetic look with me. I guess I want a real friend, maybe a bff if we really hit it off.

About me: I'm a 36-year-old divorced father of two who is not looking for romance or intimate connection right now; getting back into the world of the living is where I want to start. I used to play soccer (and would like to still) and wrestle, and I love writing. I have started and gotten fifteen to twenty pages in on about fifty books over the course of my life. I am also a teacher, although I am currently questioning that path. I love to have fun, but I am a hurting soul and am both a little awkward and a little uptight at times. I want to find that happy spark again, and I think having friends, paired with the joy of my children, is the ticket.

Let me know if you live on the west side of town (Arvada, Wheatridge, Littleton, Lakewood, Golden, etc.) and would like to spend part of Saturday evenings worshiping God.

Cheers!

I am looking for a fun lady, a partner in crime, just someone who likes to go out and have fun without any of the pressures of dating. I like to do a lot of things and with summer coming, there are going to be even more things. The only limit I would put is that you should be 50 or over. Personally you can be younger if you want, but I am over and its all about what you are comfortable with. That being said, everything else is negotiable. I do not care about anything else. Its a friend thing. If you feel self conscious about your looks or size then this is perfect for you. All of that judgmental stuff is checked at the door. I am by far not perfect and everyone will be met with a smile. What the heck, give it a shot.

Re-posting this.

Hi my name is Adam. Since this is a CL personal's ad, let me first be clear on one point: I am NOT on here looking for sex. Not now, not down the road once you know me better. If that's what you think friendship is, well there are (and unfortunately from my viewpoint) a lot of posts from people who agree with you. Try them.

Now that that is out of the way, let me tell you a little of who I am and why I AM posting on here. It will be the first time I've done so. I'm posting on here because I believe the world we live in makes deep and intimate human connection difficult and therefore hard to come by, at least for me. Honestly, I don't know how to build a real friendship when for many people, the occasional ""like"" on Facebook or ""LOL"" text message constitutes friendship. That and all the rules that forbid men from getting close to one another physically, emotionally, spiritually, or any other _ally unless they are into homosexuality. Sorry, but I reject both the notions of superficial non-connected friendships as well as the opposite that ""real men"" only interact in fist bumps and bro-hugs and don't actually have any kind of feelings or need for anyone but themselves unless for sex.

What I wish I had right now was a friend, about my age, who feels as deeply about things (and other people) as I do. Who isn't afraid to show it. Who isn't afraid to talk to about hard things, but whom I can also go out and do things with, be real with, have fun with, and feel like said friend desires and values me as a friend as much as I value him. I'll be honest, there are some hard things in my life, some that I haven't completely figured out yet. I wouldn't be on here posting that I need friends if that were not the case. But as I said, I also would love to have another man to just do things with. I like racquetball, ping pong, camping, hiking, volleyball, disc golf. I love conversation, and I don't avoid the difficult topics. But I find that I sit around entirely too much since I haven't found anyone to do any of that with. A little help on that front would be appreciated.

I should also say that I have deep convictions about a lot of things, religious, moral, political to name a few, and am not afraid to discuss those topics, as long as it stays respectful. But those convictions also are a way of life for me. I try my best to actually live according to my beliefs, though I often fail at it. On that note, I don't drink or smoke anything so meeting up for a drink or 420 isn't my thing.

If you likewise want such a friend, I may be your man. Just so you have a little more idea of who I am, I'm 29, from South Carolina, but live in Centennial now (near at least some places in Aurora). I am looking for friends around my age (say 20s to about 35 maybe). Not that I mind older people, I just feel I need a peer more than a mentor. I travel a lot for work, which sadly means I'm sometimes gone for a few days at a time, hence at least part of the hard time finding steady friendships in my life.

I probably am one of the more unusual men you'll ever meet. I guess a man who looks for other men in CL ads for anything other than sex is already a little weird, but hey, you're looking in the platonic section too, so let's be weird together. If you'd like to talk more or meet up, feel free to email back. We can start there.

Hi there,

It's disingenuous to go on as if there's no romantic hopes wrapped up in this. Since I am really too busy those hopes are being deferred in favor of something more tangible. I just want interesting email and for some reason I communicate better with women. So, what's on your mind?

A little about me: I'm married with two small children. Me and my wife are in an open relationship so talking to me will not produce drama. In fact if we ever start meeting in person you'll even meet her. I'm hispanic, 5'10"", reliably male, look like I like to eat (but I did lose 30lbs this year, yay me!), and really good with oak tree identification. I'm well educated (master's in soil ecology), well traveled (4 continents, 14 countries, 49 states), and impractical. I'm an odd bird and open-minded. There's very little you can say that will surprise me. I'm happy and I think my life is pretty awesome. 

Some people are confused by my vocabulary so I'll simplify this message. I want to email women. No pictures. No sexting. G-rated conversation. I would like to find a girlfriend someday, but I'm too busy to actively look. If you send me pictures, flirt, and go on as if you're interested in dating me then I may ask you out. If you don't then I will assume you just want someone to talk to. I'm all ears and promise I won't go all 'tear in my beer' on you.

Greetings Fellas,

New to Denver from the east coast and looking to make some new friends around town - preferably near Capitol Hill or downtown Denver. 

About Me: 
27 years old, full time professional, have a masters degree, love travel, working out, surfing and getting outdoors for some hiking or snowshoeing. I'm also interested in the arts, politics - not a huge sports fan, but like to get out and catch a game every now and then - and having long philosophical talks about life. Have a girlfriend, and not looking for any kind of friends with benefits - just pals! I like to dress well, but don't go overboard about it - basically, I'm a very friendly, active, smart, well dressed, Mr Perfect! Far from it, but Hey, you can try right?

What I'm Looking for: 
Basically, I'm looking for a young guy similar in age, and work situation to me who is also looking to make new friends in Denver. Ideally, you are looking for guy / guys to go hiking with, hang out and grab a few beers on the weekend, watch some Netflix and talk about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I go to Club Form Fitness downtown on 17th and if you also go there and we can put in a workout together - awesome. If you like Bodyspace, but aren't a meat head - we should be friends.

Feel free to reach out on here - send a picture of yourself if you like, or describe yourself if you like, and lets grab a drink or a burger sometime. Always great to meet new people.

If you're around my age & you're posting in the strictly platonic section or reading through post, then chances are you're experiencing the same difficulties I am. Being an adult & making new friends to substitute for the ones lost to marriages, children, & careers can be quite difficult sometimes. Therefore, if you're like me, you've resorted to utilizing the internet in hopes of discovering like-minded individuals with similar interest, passions, views, & beliefs as yourself to develop new friendships with, & enjoy fun & intriguing activities & events with. 

I'm a nerdy, abstract, melodic & obscure atypical CO native with a passion for intricate & melodic music, art, & design with a career in technical support & an affinity for shirt ties & a dapper flair, with indie, punk & alternative roots. It's that expression of music, art, & design that overflows into my surrounding & around my home. I'm charming & can contribute my witty humor, intelligence & vibrant demeanor to any fun conversations of substance, but still reveal a glimpse into my profane side. And I always appreciate different perspectives & stimulating thoughts. 

On any given night, I can be found on the Boulevards among the cityscapes of downtowns, traversing main streets & city parks, listening to the sounds of old guitars & live melodies, indulging in cultured interest (museums, galleries, the theatre, etc.), or sipping cocktails at a hole-in-the-wall. Otherwise, find me near a good heat source, unwinding at home with a glass of vino (or other adult concoction) & a good movie or book, or while sketching, painting & listening to jams.

Maybe we can go to a burlesque & comedy show at Lanny's Clock Tower; see a play or movie, go to an art gallery or museum, do karaoke or trivia night at a pub, or catch a band & some live music. I'm always down to things that are outside of the box as well. 

Sometimes my good qualities are overlooked by the fact that I have a disability. Everyone has imperfections & obstacle to overcome, it's one of mine. To the right people it never seems to be an imperfection at all though. So, if you're interested & think we'd get along, shoot me a response.

I am a strait man. m4w mw4mw m4m mw4ww

Seeking my new best friend 
46 year old married female looking for a female friend. My kids are grown and out of the house. I love spending time with my husband but I also need to have some girl time and he is very understanding of that. I don't care if your married or single but if you have to be attached to your hubby at all times this won't work. I'm in search of a best friend that is interested in anything from shopping and working out together to just hanging out, having a couple drinks and watching girly movies. I live away from the city and work in Denver (overnight shift) but am trying to get away from that shift and back to some normalcy. I have a membership at Planet Fitness in Aurora so would love to have someone that is an early riser that would want to go workout or grab a coffee and chat as this is the time I am usually heading home from work. Also like to go boating, camping, dancing, karaoke, gardening, crafts etc. I'm pretty open to activities just really need someone to be my partner in crime because nothing is as much fun alone. If your interested and are looking for something similar let me know and we'll work it out. My only requirement for a new best friend is that you are nonjudgmental, drug and drama free.

Settling in town, don't have that big a circle of friends and thought this wouldn't hurt. I have been told to be quite attractive, fun, and intelligent (know the difference between their, there and they're lol).

In my 20's, tall, come from a diverse background, Handsome and in great shape, high sex drive and just really enjoy the company of an attractive female. 

No specific type on my end, just be in shape, fun to talk to and good company. Fair enough?
I know there's gotta be normal people on here who are looking for the same lol, I'm sure I'm not the only one.

Also, I realized I'm not exactly sure what I'm wanting so keeping an open mind. I hope you would too... If we just end up being good friends, I'm happy with that. FWB? Sure. maybe something more or something less....

I'm missing something in my relationship, I'm not quite sure what it is. It's not sex, it's not attention. The closest I can come to is I'm missing support and affection. Perhaps you're missing these things. Perhaps you're missing something else. It doesn't matter entirely, the point is that you and I are here to support each other and to comfort each other, listen to each other's frustrations. Neither you or I are looking to change our situations. In fact I'm here to support your relationship and you are mine.

Firstly, I wanted to start by saying I'm looking for PLATONIC friendship. Not many people on CL know what that means -- it's a FRIEND; nothing sexual or weird. No, platonic people don't ""hang out nude"" so stop creepin.

That said, i'm a straight/married guy looking for like minded people to hang out with. I've lived in Colorado for 3 years now and have not had much luck finding people around my aged with similar interests. 

About me:
*A little big into video games but not overly so, like some people can be. I simply like hanging out, playing PS4 online, or playing the occasional couch co-op game with chill dudes. I'm not super competitive, but I can be if people want a more ""serious"" match of CoD or something. Otherwise, I prefer laid back gaming on GTA5 or Destiny, etc.

*I'm into fitness and bettering myself. I do go to the gym 4 days a week and i'm working on putting on more muscle weight. That said, i'm not a meathead. I'm just finally trying to get some positive change going.

*I work a Mon-Fri job with steady income. But even between work and gym, I still have time to hang out/etc.

*I love the mountains and the outdoors, especially in warmer weather. I wouldn't say I'm super active, but the occasional mountain drive or camping is right down my ally.

*My wife and I try to get out to movies, bowling, mall, shooting pool, etc. We enjoy exploring many local breweries. I haven't been drinking as much as I used to due to trying to stay healthier, but I can't help the fact that there are so many good beers in my area!

I'm really hoping to find people in their early to mid 20s to hang with. If interested, reply with some info about yourself. I'm in Thornton and it would be awesome to find people with similar interests in my area.

Hi 😀
I'm a nice guy looking for a sweet, cute and funny girl to go places and do things with. I have a lot of interests and am always open to new ideas. I have been in Colorado for a little over a year and was married when I got here, but now I'm separated and my wife is in Florida indefinitely. I miss all the things that couples do together but I'm not looking for sex or a relationship any deeper than a great friendship. That being said I am very affectionate and love holding hands and cuddling. I like going to dinner and movies, concerts, grungy dive bars, casinos and flea markets I'm a little on the older side, 53, but I look and act younger. I'm told I'm good looking and funny. If you are interested and hanging out let me know. I would prefer someone local. Age doesn't matter. You can be younger or older. I'm polite, friendly and respectful. And I hate to even have to mention this but I am not a psycho 😀

Hi!

I'm not sure what it is about my life that has me yearning for conversation from time to time, but it is there and I am simply after conversation. I'm interested in people that can discuss anything - the price of fish in China, the latest presidential poll numbers, romance, hobbies, the temperature of the closest mountain top, sex, or whatever else. I'm not in a place where I can offer any kind of relationship, but that wouldn't stop me either, I suppose; so, you're relationship status is not a critical matter to me. As far as I'm concerned you could be single, married, divorced, have a boyfriend, have a girlfriend, or whatever, as long as we are able to discuss things openly and honestly it doesn't matter to me.

Hello!! I am 27 years old and just moved to Denver recently. I am looking to meet some new people and have a good time. I am easy to get along with, but tend to be rather shy until I get to know someone a little. I tend to have trouble finding and meeting people, as I am not one to begin openly socializing. I enjoy many different things, I love to go and explore new surroundings, movies, dinners, traveling, hiking, spending time with friends, grabbing drinks with good people, anything outside, and anything adventurous or exciting. I would love to learn how to mountain climb! I am easy going and laid back. My interests are broad and varied. I am open to trying/doing new things. Most importantly, I would like to meet some new friends! So if I sound like someone you would get along with and would be interested in meeting, send me an email, tell me a little bit about yourself, and please include a picture so I have a face with the name. I will respond back with one in return, as well!

I know Craigslist isn't the best place to meet people unless you're looking for serial killers, but I read through this section a lot so I figured I may as well post my own ad. Can't hurt, right? 

I met my best friend on here almost five years ago. Now we live really far away from each other and have sort of fallen apart recently. I miss the camaraderie that comes with being around someone who knows all your secrets - someone who knows you like the back of their own hand. I have some awesome friends, but they're all guys... and while I love them, it's nonetheless a lot of testosterone and none of them love the botanic gardens like I do. 

Anyway, I'm rambling. I'm 22, have my own place & car, and have two dogs and a cat. I love going out & doing things with my dogs - so if you have dogs, that'd be great! We go to Chatfield Dog Park a lot, or Elk Meadows in Evergreen when I have time. This summer I'd like to be outside a lot, so I hope you want to go hiking. 

I'm basically looking for someone who I can share everything with. Someone who's down for midnight drives to the mountains, concerts on a whim, all sorts of adventures, spontaneous road trips, sitting on the kitchen floor at three in the morning while we talk endlessly and do our nails. You know, that kind of cliché friendship I'm sure we all crave. I don't party, drink, smoke or do other drugs, and I've never been to a club or a bar (not that there's anything wrong with those things, I'm just lame), so if you're similar in that regard, I think we'd get along super well. :) 

Hit me up if you'd like. Please, no guys. There's enough sausage in my life.

A Little about me:
I am a black woman, 40 years old, 5'7"", 150 pounds. I'm kinda girly--I paint my toenails and wear lip gloss for work and nice outings, but I also LOVE to put on a dingy T-shirt and raggedy baggy pants to hang out in the woods.

I love the outdoors scene--hiking, taking weekend road trips to places I've never been and camping is an ABSOLUTE MUST. I'd like to get my Jeep Wrangler (and German Shepherd puppies) this summer-- for now I have my car and my motorcycle to get me from point A to point B.

I have a few trips planned for this year: SCUBA diving in St. Lucia and Mexico--and if I could find a partner to road trip to the canyons in Arizona and the Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico that would be awesome. 

I absolutely love to discuss ideas, meaning that I am interested in intelligent conversation about life, but I also love to do silly things like putting on nothing but an over-sized t-shirt, blasting my stereo and dancing to music that makes me love the fact that I'm alive. Sometimes, instead of taking bites out of a Snickers bar and eating it like a ""normal"" person, I shove the whole thing in my mouth 'cause somehow it seems to taste soooo much better that way. After reading that you may not believe this next thing, but I do have a professional job and I'm very much looking forward to advancing in my work. 

What I am looking for:
It is very hard to describe all that I am attracted to in an introductory post. I am hoping that by you reading a little about who I am, you will have a good idea if you and I would be a good fit -- but I'll give you a glimpse of what I'm looking for here...

Intellectually, I'm looking for someone whose values (honesty, integrity, courage, intellect, communication and much more!!) parallel mine; someone who's strong in areas that are not my strength so that I may learn from him; someone who wants to be my friend and who wants to get to know me before we go further. I'd like to meet someone who intellectually challenges me as well as his own ideas. Age is not necessarily important to me (although I really can't see myself dating someone in their 20's), but maturity level is.

It goes without saying that I would like to meet someone whose face and body I enjoy looking at, but there is no way for me to be able to tell if I enjoy looking until we meet. All I can say here is that I am mostly attracted to mature-acting men (race does not matter) who are much taller than I (again, I am 5'7).

On a personal note:
I am single, I do not have any children nor do I want any. That's not to say I am not interested in anyone with children, I'm just saying that I am not interested in having any of my own.

Hello, I'm seeking other women (ages 40 to 60 something) who would like to get together on the weekends to either walk or bike. Having a buddy or several buddies to work out is fun and motivating and a good way to make new friends. At this stage of my life, eating healthy and taking care of myself is a top priority and I want to meet positive women who want the best out of life! Hopefully we could all provide support for each other in our weight loss journey and our journey in life to take care of ourselves, physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. Reply as noted.

Hey there,
I am 47 and love getting to know poeple. The reason I am posting this is because I just like sharing things I normally wouldn't talk about. Talking with a woman who would do the same is exiting for me. I am a father and attached, and yes she knows about this little fetish of mine. She doesn't mind because 1. she trusts me 2. I have been a big part in helping her play out most of her little fetishes and desires. I like to talk about day to day things and joke around. I know this is a platonic section but just know although I am well rounded some of my subjects may involve sexual desires and experience. I am honest, non-judgmental, dominant, loving, stern, gentle, rough, creative, passionate and prefer women that are a princess in public but have a dark side. Although we will never meet I like to build friendships :)

So I find myself bored on this fine Saturday afternoon, I should be outside now that the sun is out, instead I'm here writing this ad seeking a friend.

I've tried this once without success, a friendship can't start on a bed of lies. All I want is honesty, is that hard to ask? I'm a pretty cool person though, but please lies are not a good way to start a friendship. I'm not looking to date, hence the whole friendship thing, but I figure opposites attract and wouldn't mind having a friend of the opposite sex.

I'm a really nice lady, I get along with just about anyone. I love music of all kinds, especially 80s one hit wonders, classical music and edm. My favorite artists consist of chromeo, matchbox 20, showtek, drake and avicii. My taste in music is all over the place, so random I know. I'm random though so it's okay. I love chick flicks and scary movies. I'm not a cat person, I enjoy long walks, conversations about almost anything and everything. I'm into current events, pop culture and history. So seriously we can discuss almost anything :)

Greetings, I am a bisexual guy looking for a friend to hang out with and just be guys. I currently live with my girlfriend and things are getting a little boring lol. None the less I am a young 61 5'7"" 165 lbs. short hair and moustache. I like to watch sports, movies and just about anything outdoors. I am a clean person that just wants to be myself and not judged. I am not much of a partier like I used to be but like to have fun. I would like to start emailing with someone first and then possibly meet. I usually don't suck on the first date.......just kidding. Meeting a couple would be fun too where the guy is bi.

I'll try my best to describe what I'd like, but I think the right person will understand. First of all, I""m not looking to meet. Where I am is not particularly relevant, but let's just say it's way too far for a meeting, even if I was interested. Basically, I'm looking for conversations that are outside our daily lives, the stuff you wouldn't normally voice out loud. This encompasses so many things, which I'm not going to list, but let's just say I speak my mind, No topic is off limits or ""too soon"" if it's funny. 

For the most part, I miss laughing. I had an on-line friend for about two years, and we used to have a lot of these weird conversations- and about our daily lives too- but I mostly miss those random, uninhibited thoughts that showed me who he really was. That's my take on it anyway- most of what we show the world on a daily basis is the version of ""us"" that is socially acceptable. I'd like to find someone who accepts me even if it doesn't always sound safe or sane. I'd like to do the same for you.

If you think this is for you, please feel free to introduce yourself, and include the same stats I've listed about myself in this ad. Oh, two things: 1) Please be a decent writer, who will write more than two sentences of ""text speak"". I will not respond to one- two line emails, or retarded questions like ""Are you real?""; 2) Please have time to write more than once in a blue moon. I think once a day is reasonable, given all the responsibilities we have at home and work. It could be more on some days, but if you expect frequent emails every day, I'm not the one.

Finally, please don't be offended if I don't respond. It's not personal, it's Craigslist. In any case, thank you for taking the time to read my ad.

Well, maybe not STRICTLY platonic (but we'll start there). No reasonable person worth meeting EVER posts or looks in the ""let's go have sex"" categories, I know this is true! :)

Seeking an attractive, fit, and interesting woman, age 40-60 who is also looking for friendship, and occasionally getting together for a walk, a talk, a lunch, a croissant & Espresso, a bike ride, a couple hours out listening to live music. Casual romance is a possibility, but absolutely NOT a requirement or expectation. You do not have to be in a relationship, but it will probably be easier that way, so we have the same limitations and both have a strong motivation towards discretion. Again, this would be casual, no expectations, I am not looking for someone who wants to get serious, but I do like the idea of a long-term friendship, if we develop that kind of connection. 

I am smart, fit, nice looking (I look young for my age, and I take care of myself), artistic, and a good listener and talker. I have a very flexible schedule, live in central Denver, love to walk and bike, and love an excuse to go out to some of these new great restaurants Denver keeps getting. I like dogs. I have a dry sense of humor, and lots of passion. Lots.

I prefer a non-smoker, open-minded, who is ""conscious-but-not-self-conscious"", who can talk about spiritual & philosophical things and even religion or politics without getting crazy. Self confidence, a zest for living and lots of interests. 

Yes, this is a long shot.... but you just never know! Strange & wonderful things happen every day.

Thought I would get a head start on this
Looking for someone interested in escaping the city to go enjoy the country this summer. 
I am thinking of some 3 day weekends, maybe a longer trip over July 4th
I go to the old family farm in Nebraska. Yes there is running water, indoor plumbing and a shower. You get your own room. This is a great place to get away from the big city. There is usually cell phone service and not far from a town
I have family I meet there every year, would just enjoy a companion to join me. Need a helper for some construction/repair projects. Might take some other trips also
You really don't need any money, everything is covered
If interested, just email me and I can fill you in more
Is always good to meet first
Nobody under 18 please
I am not a party person, not looking for anything other than friendship

Hi people,

38 yo T-girl, I work from home late nights and I don't really get out much

Usually when I'm off work I like going fast, and when I spin I get pretty chatty

Problem is I tend to be awake when most everyone I know is asleep,

So basically looking for just fun friendly conversation, not nessicarily looking for anything sexual but if the chat ends up going that direction later on I won't really discourage it.

I'm a bit of a geeky artistic type, love to draw, paint, love classical music theater ballet that kind of stuff.

Not looking to meet up cause as I said I don't get out much (not a total shut in or anything just really more of a homebody)

Women, both cis and trans will go to the front of the line but guys, if you're cool I'll chat with you too

If I sound interesting, go ahead and respond to this ad or feel free to contact me on kik my name there is jessicarvn

I'm athletic, fun, down to earth and have my life together. I enjoy meeting new friends and having some laughs. I do have pics to trade and hope to chat soon.
I'm real, it's nice out and feels like beginning of spring, oh and the Broncos winning the Superbowl hasn't worn off. Talk soon

Slow day at the office, would be fun to make a new friend to chat with, maybe grab a drink or something but definitely fine with just emailing or texting. I have a good job with a flexible schedule.

Hi. I'm looking for a new friend. Yes, a platonic email pen pal -- but that sad little phrase makes it seem way too basic and cliché. It's really much more than that. Anything physical is off the table (and to be honest I don't really feel obligated to explain why right now). But who I am interested in connecting with, is the woman in the Starbucks line who took extra time that morning to dress nice, put on those boots she feels pretty and confident in, but then sighs and wonders why she bothered. Or the one who sits in the tub at night, drinking wine out of a coffee cup, who just finished sorting out all the kid runs for tomorrow, and the homework that's due, and amid the smell of lavender and make-up remover takes fifteen minutes to secretly hate the guts of her female unmarried friend who took that exotic vacation, and callously posted the pics on Facebook. We're not bitter people at our core, but we've battled through enough where some days a good ear to listen, a nap and a little agenda-less flirting sounds amazing. I'm actually a clean-cut, happy, hopeful and kind guy, non smoker, no drugs, no tattoos. I'm an attentive listener, I think I'm hilarious anyway. I'm basically just a dreamer/romantic who needs somewhere or someone for my musings and flirty words to land on. Maybe we can help each other. Talk with you soon, Scott

I have plenty of good friends in my life but not too many gay friends. Yeah, its great hanging out with my straight friends but it would be nice to find other guys like myself who have the same interest when it comes to the same sex. No offense but not really looking for feminine guys. I live a pretty discrete life so it just fits. The crowd I hang out with doesn't provide an opportunity to meet other gay guys like myself or that I would ever really hang out with so that's a bit of the dilemma. I am not looking for sex....particularly. Mainly looking for other laid back drama-free masculine gay guys who are fun to hang with....if other things happen then they happen but I am NOT looking to get laid here as top priority.

I'm posting this ad in the hopes of finding some new couples to spend time with, who aren't flaky and have the ability to commit to making plans ahead of time. I'm sure if you're taking the time to read this ad, you probably have friends like this - the kind who always complain about how they're bored and want to do stuff, but as soon as you propose doing something you get radio silence. Therefore, if you are also a couple that wants to make new friends that are actually up for DOING things, let's talk! I'm posting this in the Denver section because even though we live outside of Colorado Springs, coming from the East Coast where it takes an hour to drive 15 miles on most days, driving doesn't bother either of us. If you live in Castle Rock or the south suburbs, we aren't all that far apart.

One of the biggest reasons we moved to Colorado was to be able to enjoy the outdoors, so we want to meet other people who like to be outside and want to go hiking or visit new places on a semi-regular basis. We're not going camping in the woods for days at a time or anything but when it's nice out, we are not sitting inside all day. Basically, it would be great to find other couples who are interested in stuff like having a backyard BBQ or taking a longer drive to a nice hiking spot to get away from the more popular places. We have an awesome dog so she usually comes with us when we go hiking. Finding a couple with a dog that also wants to get out and explore would be great, but you don't have to have a dog as long as you don't hate them or something. 

My husband loves football, video/computer games (what dude doesn't?) and is in the process of getting his Masters degree. We both have hard science degrees, love to travel and do not smoke anything so we aren't looking for smoking buddies. We don't have kids, and are looking for people in the same boat. 

If anything about this sounds familiar to you, feel free to shoot me an email so we can chat some more! I really hope there are some people out there who are in the same boat - there is too much cool stuff to do around here to sit inside and not get out and see it!

There's a new social nudist group in Denver for younger nudists or guys who might be interested. 

I'm 31, white active and fit. I've been a nudist for 10 years. I love the bonding and brotherhood aspect. Our group is focused on young men under 45. 

I've formed a group on Meetup called Denver young men's nudist brotherhood. Look it up on there or shoot me an email. 

The group is all about naked parties, game nights, drinking watching a game or whatever. Just laid back activities at a private home where we just chill naked. Open to all sexualities since it's not a sex group. But tantric massage or edging could be possibilities for gatherings. Cool with 420. 

So if you're a nudist, naturalist, exhibitionist or wanted to try it but couldn't find dudes your age this group is for you.

As I mentioned I like outdoors etc but im not a ""weekend warrier"" type. I like my down time at home watching the games, movies, tv, cooking grilling, and my time with my dogs and partner.

Hi,

My wife told me the other day, ""You need more friends"". She's right. Trouble is that I'm an odd bird so it's not exactly easy to find someone I connect with. I tend to make friends with women, but work in a nearly all male work place. Add to that I'm not great with small talk. How you get me to converse is by talking about something intense and substantive. Only after that do we get to the small things. I don't follow or sports or TV so I don't have much to talk about with most of humanity. 

And I'm fine with that, except sometimes it's a problem. Like when I want to get a beer and there's no one to do that with. Or when I want some company to help me with a project and there's no one to do that with. Or I want to hear an outside perspective and there's no one to tell me theirs. Everyone needs more than just one person. 

So here I am, quixotically trying to make friends on the internet. I'm not attempting a clandestine affair either. My wife knows about my goings on and is fine with me talking to other women. If it gets to the point where we go out for a beer you'll meet her most likely. 

So maybe you have similar ideas about fun. Fun for me is having a great conversation. You know one of those conversations that make you grow brain cells, not just because you may have learned something new, but because you've seen how to connect the dots differently. Fun for me is a long evening stroll, a game of trivial pursuit, or going out to eat interesting food. Fun for me is also geeking out about plants or animals, but I don't expect anyone else to share that. 

The point of this posting is to find someone to hang out with in real life. I like this whole world of electronic communication, and really like giving and getting email candy, but it's like snacking when you really need a meal. So be warned. After a few emails I'll probably ask you out (2nd warning. I write ridiculously long emails). Anyway, just putting this out into the universe and seeing what happens.

***If you do not change the subject to your favorite color, I will assume you're a bot and delete you***

I am looking for somewhat of an ongoing thing; if you just want to talk just for a day or so, please let me know in advance. 

(I am posting in the Strictly Platonic section because there will be no meetings and no actual sex)

Would you like an online chat buddy?

I am looking for someone to chat with through email. We could talk about anything interesting, but I would like there to be some flirting, innuendo, and even some back-and-forth dirty chatting, if you're interested, but no pressure. There will be no pressure for actual sex, only online encounters. This will give us both the freedom to share whatever we want, without fear of embarassment.

You can share pictures without face, if you feel comfortable, but not required. Total anonymity is the goal.

I would like you to have a sense of humor, be articulate, and not be self-absorbed or rude. I would want us to both be free to share stories, fantasies, or whatever without judgement from the other person. I do have limits on what I will not talk about.

I am only looking for sane, stable, non-married people.

I prefer 21-40 year old physically fit people, but that is not an absolute requirement.

If you would like to have this type of online encounter, maybe allow your inner sexual personality to come out a bit, then email me. Change the subject line to your favorite color to eliminate spam. When responding, please tell me a little about yourself; short responses like ""hey"" will probably not get a reply.

So I am giving this a shot, let's see where it goes. The title pretty much says it all. I would like to find a good friend who would be open to being intimate later on. I moved to CO last June from NC. Haven't had the best of luck relationship wise so I want to take a break from the whole dating scene in general. I go to school full time and nanny part time. It would be great to find someone that lived near me. Honesty is always appreciated. If we did become intimate I would like to know if you do sleep with someone else. Our friendship can continue but the sexual relationship will have to stop. I am not discriminate of age or race. Just looking for a friend I can go out with on occasion, cuddle and watch movies/Netflix with, play board games with, make dinner with and just have someone to talk to.

About me: I am 32 years old. Former Marine. Associate Degree in Early Childhood Education. Working on a degree in Solar Energy Technology. I have an 8 year old boxer.

So I'm new to Colorado. I have been here for close to two months now. So far I'm absolutely loving it here! 

What I'm looking for : someone that loves to go out, see and do new things, again I'm new here there is ALOT of things to see and do. 

I LOVE to go to country concerts, heck I'll go solo! lol 

If you don't like country music, this probably won't work! 

I'm a very busy person, I'm working 3 jobs starting next week. Doesn't mean I don't have time to hang out or grab a beer at one of the many local brewery's. 

So more about me: I'm kinda a odd mix of country boy, surfer, GQ... lol fashion is a big deal to me, good chance I dress better than you! Ha 

I just moved here from Hawaii. I spent the last year there surfing and finishing my sommelier course. It's was a epic adventure! 

I'd love to meet the right girl / adventure buddy that hopefully could turn into something more.

I ❤️ Country girls!

Trolls in the personality sense. Everyone is sensitive about something, that does not make an individual thin skinned. You know the phrase, don't throw stones at a glass house.

Hello gentlemen,

First, let me say that I am not located in Colorado. I live in Atlanta, Ga. I have family in Colorado and have visited there before. I really like the atmosphere and people so I figured I would try to make some new friends there. 

I am an African American female with asymptomatic HSV2 (Herpes). I am only looking for someone to chat with. I am not really looking for a relationship right now. 

Even though I do not plan on meeting anyone, I still want to give a description of myself. I am attractive, professional, educated, and active (I am always training for some 5k/10k race). I have a job, my own place and car, no kids, 5'6, HWP, brown complexion, average build w/curves (I do workout, but I am not slim), short hair, great personality, positive attitude, and an awesome smile. . .I had to throw that in there. 

So, do not ask for a pic and there is no need to send one of yourself. I mean, we all want someone that we are attracted to, but I am not looking for a man...just a friend. 

Have a great day!

I'm headed up to Winter Park next Monday morning (tickets have been purchased) and would love for someone or a few folks to join me, at least for the ride up, which is free of charge. I can drive but I don't have a rack that holds equipment but I believe average skis/boards will likely fit inside my Subaru Forester SUV. As for skiing, I'm new to the sport but can do the easiest of the greens. No worries - you don't have to baby sit me on the slopes but I'm just looking to meet some new folks and at least have some company on the ride up and back. I also like to grab a few beers while skiing so if you're into that, that's cool.

Attached, Bored, Confident and Discreet looking to strike up a casual friendship without the implicit objective of getting in the sack. 

I rank intelligence over beauty, simplicity over complex, sushi over fast food, whiskey over beer and natural over fake. I have traveled quite a bit. I like Trump even though not into politics. Some of the TV shows I enjoyed are slow detective dramas, house of cards, survivor and exotic (not disgusting) food. I work out couple of times a week to stay healthy. 

I am looking to connect with someone intelligent to share thoughts and maybe a drink now and then. I would prefer that you are attached and/or a parent. This way we have few more things to share. I will not send a pic nor do I need yours. I do expect the friendship to be based on reality. I won't be asking questions that are not relevant to friendship or things that are none of my biz. I do prefer someone who is local and with intellectual maturity. I like someone with interests and someone interesting.

Hey ladies! How would you like to earn some fairly easy cash?? I must warn you, you might think it's a bit crazy haha but hear me out. All you need to do is have fairly good ""self-control"" :)
Here's how it works: You will be asked to drink a fairly large amount of your choice of either water, tea, juice, soda, beer, etc. within a certain amount of time. Then your money making opportunity will begin! After drinking all that liquid obviously you will need to pee, but the longer you can hold your pee the more money you will earn!!!!
5 dollars for every 10 minutes that you can hold on, that's $30 an hour!!!

I told you this would be a bit crazy but really you can see it is pretty easy money! If this sounds like something crazy enough for you to try, please feel free to send me an email. We can chat for a bit about the details of this, and when/where it would take place. Again, this is a completely legit offer, and only email me if you have a serious interest in perhaps trying this out.

Hope to hear from you soon!

Hey everyone. I've been here over a month now but I still feel out of place. I have been a few places downtown but that gets old. I'm sure Denver has nice, classy places for those of us over 30. I'm not into loud bars or clubs. The breweries are nice but it's the same old in each one. 

Isn't here a nice cocktail bar? How about a rooftop hangout spot that oversees the city? Where do people hang out during the day outdoors? 

I'm sure there's hidden gems but it really sucks not knowing a place that I'm sure has potential. If only I had a guide to this place Denver would be alright.

Me: Single father of wonderful kids. My life is a collage of school, appointments, activities, tutoring with little time for myself except for work. I wouldn't change my life, but I need some grown-up time with new friends, and a chance to channel physical interests, even if they stay platonic. I'm in a rut and spending too much time lost in daydreams or fantasies that don't lead anywhere. I would like an evening out or two and remember what it was like to be with someone fun.

Hello everyone. I am looking for an awesome girl to text/chat with throughout the day and night. I really enjoy scifi and the more nerdy aspects of life. I enjoy hiking and the outdoors.

Hi potential future friend. I am a 28 year-old guy in Summit County--I'm about 6'2, 175, tall/thin, athletic, and consider myself attractive. I've been in a long-term relationship for around 6 years. Looking for a new female friend, life can be a little dull in tourist land. I'm educated, semi-normal, and I enjoy all kinds of sports, food, travel, kayaking, hiking, tons of music, 420, etc. I make it to Denver/front range regularly for work, shows, sporting events, or whatever looks interesting. I work in a field with all guys and miss the spark of getting to know a new female friend. I'm not above flirting and the potential of more than friends if it comes to that--or not. Either way, I'm pretty open minded and just looking for a new connection. Hope to hear from you. :)

Sometimes platonic friendship between a man and a woman comes into question. It's like there's never a situation that is 100% devoid of sexual tension on at least on parties' behalf. This, to me, is the most intriguing aspect of the male/female connection.

Sometimes, as a guy, we know the reasons why things can't go further. Women get this, as well. Even when this is the case, there is STILL some underlying tension! Why? Soooo fascinating.

So, I say let's embrace that moment. What if, say, while you were venting about your life, and you caught me with that look in my eye? That look that says ""I want you. I can't have you, but I still want you."" What if I proceeded to masturbate myself while I espoused my fantasies of how things would go if we were who were in a parallel universe? 

We can get high. We can be friends. We'll never touch or kiss or make love or play with each other's nipples... but we'll entertain the idea the way we'd entertain the idea of making it big.

Seems like Craigslist men are up to their old tricks again. Using strictly platonic to get some sort of sexual gratification in the fictitious way they try to write a ad. Its pathetic. 

I am seeking a male or female it does matter and I didn't have the choice to pick either when writing this posting so I flipped a coin. I have lived in Colorado for a very long time and I am no stranger to where the ghost towns are or old mining places. Some can be driven up too while others
require a hike. Either way its really amazing on how beautiful the places are. I will attach a few pictures to the place I went to just last weekend. It was called Gold Hill 10 miles as the crow flies
from Boulder. From it extends allot of other trails. Have you ever seen a glacier lake? They are very blue and very deep. From the edge of the lake you have about 8 inches then its straight down.
Looking from now till end of summer

Hi there, I'm David. I'm a 30 yr old male born and raised in Colorado. First, a little about what I'm looking for....

I'm basically just interested in meeting new people in various ways. Everything from friends to hang out with, people to do arts with, a woman to love, or even a couple to become close with. I'm very open minded and am interested in getting out and experiencing new parts of life. I would love to find someone to personally connect with, but am also open to NSA fun with someone if it were to happen that way.

Now for a little about myself...

I am a very open, honest, and positive person. I enjoy many aspects of life, but really have a passion for arts. Especially photography and music. I enjoy the outdoors, and try to get out as much as possible! I love to hike and backpack or anything that gets me into nature. I am not really religious, but am very spiritual. I have a 5 year old son that lives with his mother that I adore dearly and see around twice a week. 

I work currently as a Real Time Analyst at a call center. In short, I basically make sure other people are working. :-P I'd like to get into the photography and music full time soon, and have been working on making that happen. I'd like to work for myself and not someone else! :-)

Well I hope this was enough information to give you an idea of who I am. Feel free to contact me for any reason you may choose. Keep in mind, I will be very blunt and honest. I'm sure I'll get tons of weirdos and spam from this, so I will be pretty critical weeding out the reals and fakes. ;-)

Text is easiest. 3oh3 Three3Zero 0847 If you email, please leave an email to reply to, I seem to get 8 million inquiries that I'm unsure if they ever even end up getting my reply. It's like CL's email relay is messed up or something.... Will get back to you ASAP.

Ok so I live in Florida...but I am needing a getaway for a little bit, and I may be interested in moving to the area in the near future. I would love to make a friend who I could text and talk to on the phone until I come, then can show me around, introduce me to people, and keep me company when I'm in town. If I decide to move there maybe we could be roommates. If our relationship blossoms into more than a friendship than that's ok with me. I will say that I am currently in an extremely complicated, miserable relationship. We live together and that is the only thing keeping us together. Moving will be the end of our relationship, so I'm trying to start the process of moving on from her. I am 420 friendly, I don't drink, I don't mind if you do, I just don't really like the bar scene so that's not something I would be interested in doing when I come to town. I'm very laid back and go with the flow. I hope to hear from you soon :)

Dear,

Guy that's considering suicide. 

I just caught your post. I don't normally post here much and I would have emailed you but I just want to say something positive before you make a wrong choice. Plus my phone is harder to email on but if you need to talk feel free to email me.

My advice: Don't hurt yourself. It's not worth it. You have a purpose here, regardless of what assholes keep telling you.


I hope and pray that you don't hurt yourself or anyone else. I know sometimes life throws monkey wrenches at people but in order to be happy, you just need God and yourself. At least for me that's all I need but you might be different but that's ok too.

Count yourself lucky if you have somewhere to stay right now, and if you don't, I know what that's like too. Whatever rejection that comes your way just,""shake it off."" like Taylor swift wrote.

Life is rough but it gets better and I hope you know that happiness is what you make it. Just like in church today my pastor was talking about how our thoughts are a result of life. 

So if you keep thinking nobody cares you would be wrong. There's someone out there that luvs you rather it be ur mom or gf or whoever just be grateful. Jesus loves you. And he died for us all.

I'm a total stranger but I'm a rare one that cares for human life and if you ever need to chat just through email, I'm cool with it.
I make a bad ass friend. 

You can ask anyone that knows and luvs me I've been through a lot but just recently my doctor has informed me that I'm happier now, just by knowing God and not forcing my beliefs on others just living my own life. 

I will pray for you and I hope this emotional pain your feeling fades quickly. 

God bless!

My kids are grown and gone and now I'm looking for friends to get out and enjoy life with. I am single and looking to meet people in a similar situation (single with kids that are older, not little ones)

Here's a list of things I'm interested in. Some of these I may not be currently doing but would like to.
I'm a few extra pounds but I still like to stay active so I enjoy biking, hiking, other outdoor actives, and the gym, all at a novice pace.
Jet skiing, snow mobiling, fishing, rafting, live music (r&b), comedy clubs, getting out once in awhile (need to flirt with men somewhere), movies, dinner, casinos, bbqs, Broncos, etc.

Having similar personalities is important in making friends so a little bit more about me.
I date all ethnicities.
I'm a democrat.
I mostly listen to r&b
I'm completely straight and only looking for friends.

If you choose to respond, please send a pic so I know I'm talking to a real person.

Hey!

I recently moved to Colorado and I don't know too many people here. I like trying new things and exploring. I like painting & sipping wine, checking out new restaurants, going to the gym, building with legos, and going places with my little husky mix. I just like doing things. I studied biology in undergrad and now I'm prepping for medical school. 

I like being spontaneous but I also like lazy days. It'd be cool to find someone that's also down to just watch TV.

Shoot me an email with a bit about yourself. :)

Are you an educated professional woman frustrated in getting things done, due to your ADHD? I am a PhD in my 50s on CU faculty whose productivity and enjoyment of life is hindered by this problem. I would like to try addressing it by working alongside someone similarly affected. 

Just working on reading, writing, programming, bill paying, etc. across the table or room from one another might be mutually beneficial. Household projects could be addressed too.

I am single, so, if there should be a spark between us, the scope of friendship could widen. However, this is not the immediate intent of this posting.

Would love to chat/commiserate with a friend who shares this affliction. I was diagnosed more than two years ago, but this doesn't seem to be getting any easier. The medical side of it is taken care of; thankfully it's a minor case with very rare outbreaks. I'm an educated woman; I understand the statistics, which tell me that many people around me have this virus. Those statistics are not compelling to me. I feel like a pariah. I feel like I'll likely never be with another man and, damn it, I really loved sex.

Anyway, hoping to find a friend who has a better handle on this than I do and I think I'll find a man's perspective particularly helpful. Hoping to find a friend to help me navigate these waters!

We are a mid 40's couple looking for other couples to hang out with. We are easy going and drama free. We do not smoke anything or do any drugs but we are occasional light drinkers. We enjoy all kinds of activities, from heading out early on Saturdays and Sundays looking for a new coffee house, tootling around to garage sales, stopping here and there at an antique store or day trips around the country side. We like to discover new hikes/walks although I don't think we are ready to concur a 14teener yet or a bike ride. We both are into refinishing all kinds of antiques and vintage pieces plus creating some repurposed items as well. We are also just as happy staying at home enjoying BBQ's, playing a game or watching a good movie (or a few episodes of the office) with a big bowl of popcorn. If you have the same interests and want to get together, drop us a note and tell us about yourselves. Please do not respond if you are looking to swing, so not us!!

We have been married for 13 years and honestly our friends are flakes. Would love to find someone to hang out with. Yes, we have been known as swingers, freakish, and everything else, but as of this moment I just want someone who shares the same interest. We camp, hike, fish, love the outdoors, hunt, and are planning to move to Alaska. I need personal feeling and not lonely. No hidden agendas, just want a personal touch as they say. If interested for just a dinner, light drinks, and perhaps karaoke, (he hates that's but I love it), hit me up on my email. As said before, just need human contact, not customers, clients, acquaintances, or just fakes. Thanks.

Women, I am 48 and I want a friend who likes to go to the bars to listen to live music particularly on a Friday or Saturday night. I like to have a drink but not excessive. I love to talk about the eye candy. I am not a liberal minded person, as a matter of fact, I'm Trump all the way because of his message. I love rock to heavy metal as well as country and stuff on KBCO. I'm wide open when it comes to music although I will never attend a rap concert and I'm not into the Beyonce crap. I'm a bit hardcore with a super soft side. I have a filter but only use it when I have to. I love to laugh and have a good time. I love bikers, the kind that ride Harleys and I LOVE tattooes (the more the better). I am tattooed as well. I am attractive so you won't be embarrassed if we go out...not a troll :) I'm not a big talker but a great listener. I like to hike and workout and I eat healthy. I also believe in a relationship with God but am not religious. I'm not a bible thumper by no means. Almost all my friends are married or have kids still at home and they are homebodies so I find myself sitting at home cuz no one wants to go out. I know you're out there. Lets get together and find what life has for a few late forties women. I'm older but not dead.

Hey there!
I'm a 20 year old tattooed goth who is lacking in the friend department. I've got two beautiful cats, as you can see, and I live with my partner. I'm a little shy starting out but I come around pretty quickly. Love makeup and fashion and trying new food. I'm a home body and I really enjoy relaxing at home, smoking, talking, gaming, etc. I also enjoy going out to concerts or clubs every once in a while.

I enjoy going on nature walks/hikes and exploring Colorado. I'm pretty spiritual and am an eclectic witch personally, I can tell you more about that if you'd like. I'd also love to explore Colorado's paranormal side.

I just really want to make some new friends, around my age (Please nobody over 25), who are fun and don't expect too much. Someone who's chill and loves to smoke and hangout at home or get dressed up and go out to do whatever! I drink occasionally, and do drugs whenever a friend or acquaintance happens to get me some. When I say smoking I only mean weed, in case you were wondering :)

If you think we'd get along, and you'd like to hangout sometime, send me an email and we'll go from there :) Your photo gets mine, nothing romantic or sexual please. Put 'black as your soul' in the title so that I know you read it all.

PS. Here's a list of all of my favorite musicians/bands: Die Antwoord, Two Door Cinema Club, Andrew Bird, Starfucker, Basement Jaxx, Air, Tryo, Cake, Kiesza, Little Dragon, M.I.A, Miscommunicado, Miley Cyrus, Neko Case, Ozric Tentacles, Rush, The Shins, Spin Doctors, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Wolfmother, Wire Faces, The Swashbuckling Doctors, Imogen Heap, Sonic Youth

I am a 40 year old woman who works full-time and goes to school full-time (Master's degree in social work). I'm not a parent but have raised kids (long story). I have a great boyfriend and a couple of good friends, but life often gets in the way of us hanging out so I'm looking to increase the friend supply, so to speak. 

I love to do ""stuff"", meaning I'm easily entertained. I love to learn and try new things but really enjoy what I call ""exploring"". I enjoy hiking, finding ghost towns (photographing them although I haven't done it in a while), road trips, going places just because I've never been and asking questions like ""hey, I wonder where this road goes?"". I am not very feminine. Doing my hair involves washing, drying, brushing it and done. My dream car is a lifted Jeep with a winch (I currently have a wimpy Jeep but it gets me down those roads I wander). I do my own remodeling work on my house, enjoy DIY projects and crafts. I don't care for shopping. Dirt and hard work don't scare me. I love horror movies and Halloween (Yay Walking Dead!). I love conversations about anything interesting...and I find almost anything interesting. I am a ""dog person"". I prefer nature and small towns over the city.

I'm not into going out for drinks because I'm not much of a drinker and don't like bars. I'm not religious or very spiritual although I love talking about those topics from a nerdy or academic standpoint. I don't smoke and am in fact very allergic to it. Don't smoke pot although I'm not against it. I'm not into drama and am looking for friends only, nothing more. I don't care if you're ""fit"" or not, I'm not ""fit"" but am not lazy either. I think it's odd when I see that caveat in CL friends posts.....""fit and attractive"".....uhhhh....so what. This is a friends post, not online dating.

I also have sarcastic humor, if you didn't pick up on that just now. 

So if you're looking for a friend to go do ""stuff"" with, and I sound like someone you could stand to go do that stuff with, send me an email.

Hi. Happy Weekend! I decided to not go skiing this weekend so find myself with some free time. I'm have a professional career (M-F) and ski, hike or run on the weekends. I'm divorced and not looking for a relationship. I'm enjoying my freedom. Most of my friends are married with families so I find myself wanting to go see a movie, but would prefer to meet a new friend for some drinks beforehand. Maybe we could go to Alamo Taphouse/Movies off Santa Fe? Here are some movies I would like to see, but am open to suggestions. I'm looking for a woman close to my age, give or take a few years, who doesn't smoke, ideally is active and has a professional career (would like to hang out and have a nice discussion) so these attributes would most likely make it less uncomfortable. I'll be running some errands today, but checking emails and responding so please feel free to ask questions.

I am a sucker for a good back rub.

I am willing to give back/foot rubs as well

I have some kink, but if we bond well your kink is also my kink... Within reason :P

Dildos/Vibes do not intimidate me in the slightest. I think they're kinda fun :P

I like getting head, but love eating pussy more...

Bi girls to the front of the line... and it isn't even about wanting/hoping for a threeway... I just think female sexuality is awesome and envy it I guess...

I am a smoker/Vaper... Not big into 420, but not against it either.

Soo...... Are you:

21-35?

Interested?

I'm bound to get spammed, so please prove that you are a real person. I will not email you beyond the CL annon email right away, nor will I text you until I know you are real.

Its Friday and I'd like to make a new friend. 
I smoke weed in the evenings and just got a Nintendo 64 and some games... thought it would be fun to have a girl come smoke and play with me. 

I have a dab rig, shatter, planning to buy flower after work. I can host (but I do have roommates) or I can travel and bring it all with. 

Physically:
24 
5'2 n slim
Hazel eyes 
Bald 
Caramel skin 
A few tattoos and piercings 

Sexuality:
I am not looking for anything more than a friendship. I am pansexual, find all humans beautiful.

Gender identity: 
He/Him pronouns please.
I identify as non binary/Androgynous, meaning I don't feel I fit into M or F Gender, many consider me ""both"" as my brain is M and my body is F. 

Personality: 
I'm a natural shy Virgo 
Soft spoken and kind hearted. I always have weed and chocolate on hand. 
However, My inner thoughts are intense as shit, and I curse a lot.
I only open up when I'm High, so if you enjoy deep philosophical conversations when you're stoned then we will get along well! 


What I'm looking for: 
An open minded friend 
Maybe you're nonbinary too
Ita okay if not, but an acceptance and understanding of the lgbt lifestyle is required. Smoke weed, obviously. Choloate and/or Pho lover is a plus as I eat both often. 
No video game experience required, I haven't played 64 in twelve years so I'm not real competition. 

So... if an evening like this sounds enticing, please email me :) I live in Aurora near children's hospital, but I can travel to you. Please be over 21. If you have a LINE account, My tag is OnixJ, otherwise email. I'd love to hang out tonight, or make plans for another evening. 

Happy March 11th and I hope you had a great week!

You and I are here for the same reason. Like me, you are married, but the thrill is gone and passion is dead. Like me, you are lonely and want to meet someone new. You're probably nervous -I know that I am. You tell yourself that you're only looking for a friend. But deep inside, you know that you are really looking for a lover. Maybe you're not looking for a physical affair, but you're definitely looking for more than just friendship. I am too.

Let's chat and see what happens. Have a beautiful day!

We are married with children, mature, educated, and an open minded, grounded, non-religious, down to earth couple. We are interested in discovering a friend to build a potential long term friendship with. 

Our preference would be to meet people between the ages of 18-26. If you are older, please feel free to shoot us an email anyway. We will not discriminate based on race, gender, or anything else that most people tend to be discriminatory about. You must like kids and be willing to interact with us and our children.

You must possess: Good hygiene, be able to read and write, basic morals of conduct, good communication, be truly trustworthy, and very open-minded.

I can say with certainty that we have no intention of hanging out with hard narcotics users.

There is much more that is to be shared with the right person, but we would like to chat with you before going into detail about what it is that we are looking for.

If this sounds like something that might interest you, please shoot us a message and we will answer questions.

Copilot/ companion needed. My father and stepmother need me to help take care of them in Tennessee. My father has been suffering from strokes and my stepmother is in ICU with spina bifida related heart complications. I will be leaving soon and want to see if anyone out there wants to get away and start fresh in a small town.
I'll be driving an old, partially converted, military bus roughly 1,000 miles and - to put it simply - I don't want to be alone. I'm not looking for a relationship per se, and I'm not looking for sex. I don't drink or do drugs. I'm just a redneck nerd looking for a friend to take a leap of faith.

Ha... well, maybe not STRICTLY platonic (but we'll start there). No reasonable person worth meeting EVER posts or looks in the ""let's go have sex"" categories, this is true! :)

Seeking an attractive, fit, and interesting woman, age 40-60 who is also looking for friendship, and occasionally getting together for a walk, a talk, a lunch, a croissant & Espresso, a bike ride, a couple hours out listening to live music. Casual romance is a possibility, but absolutely NOT a requirement or expectation. You do not have to be in a relationship, but it will probably be easier that way, so we have the same limitations and both have a strong motivation towards discretion. Again, this would be casual, no expectations, I am not looking for someone who wants to get serious, but I do like the idea of a long-term friendship, if we develop that kind of connection. 

I am smart, fit, nice looking (I look young for my age, and I take care of myself), artistic, and a good listener and talker. I have a very flexible schedule, live in central Denver, love to walk and bike, and love an excuse to go out to some of these new great restaurants Denver keeps getting. I like dogs. I have a dry sense of humor, and lots of passion. Lots.

I prefer a non-smoker, open-minded, who is ""conscious-but-not-self-conscious"", who can talk about spiritual & philosophical things and even religion or politics without getting crazy. Self confidence, a zest for living and lots of interests. 

Email me, and you will get my story of why this posting... and remember: Strange & wonderful things happen every day!

Contractor on long term project staying in Old Town Castle Rock area seeking female companionship a few evenings weekly for diner, drinks, movies, chat, whatever. Four20 friendly, rock/pop/contemporary music, enjoy shooting pool, and just hanging out with nice people. Fit/thin, long blonde hair beard mustache, late 50's, not a fancy dresser or into fancy things..... BUT..... generous to a flaw and very willing to spoil the right person. 
If you like movies like Minions, shows like Dave Chapell, and music like Awolnation & NIN then well probably get along great. Would most enjoy younger crash and burn personality, not into the stuffed shirt professional type. Not looking for love -- just a friend to chill with.
Bottom line is motel life is VERY boring, just looking to make my stay a bit more pleasant.

Do you have a desire to feel more at ease with life, no matter what is going on?

Having your Bars run can do just that. There are 32 points on your head that correspond to things like; healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named.

They store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything.

For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called ""money.""

Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it, clearing the space for new awareness to come in.

The creative possibilities for your life begin to open up!

It's been said that at worst a Bars session will feel like a great massage. At best, it will change your life!

I see people in coffee shops, on the sidewalk, at stoplights, on the freeway, and I wonder. Everyone carries something. 

I'm a photographer in Denver working on a series of portraits. Would you be willing to tell me, and be photographed? Are you curious about others? It's a leap, I know, but I'm serious and only looking for sincere replies. See my website or blog at www.carlbower.com. I provide prints and what might be an interesting experience.

Good morning,

I am a married man. Just want to start there, not looking to change my situation. But I had another long ""conversation"" with my spouse last night about how we are not on the same page in several areas in our lives. We are not unhappy but we both know or I guess I should say mostly I know that these ""areas"" are never going to change and just have to accept them as they are. But I still long for intelligent conversation about life and its challenges. I am looking for a woman who is willing to talk about life, listen to my thoughts and intelligently respond with thoughtful insight and maybe even suggestions on a new and fresh approach. I refuse to have conversations where one participant is acting like a teenager instead of an adult and it gets frustrating. I know it sounds like the reverse of the drama couples usually see but that is my relationship. Always has been. If you are an intelligent woman who listens well and is interested, please let me know and we can chat. I think you will find the situation intriguing and even if we get nowhere the conversation can still be stimulating and rational. I have a kik account I can provide after we have some preliminary discussion and trust can be established. Looking forward to talking to someone mature enough to think beore they respond.

So I'm a 26 year old guy out in California, I'm unhappy here and not really able to find work, even through temp agencies.
Shit sucks for me and it just gets me depressed.
I honestly have no money, all I have is the clothes on my back, my car and a dozen boxes of my personal belongings in a spare bedroom at my grandfathers who's letting me stay here because it's better than living out on the streets or in my car.

I tried to move away in 2014. I went to Seattle, I loved it! Being somewhere new and different just filled me with different feelings and I liked that. I felt like anywhere but California is where I belong. Unfortunately I had to go back because I couldn't get a job quick enough. Oh well.

I took a quick look and saw that studios are as low as $600 a month and thought ""yo that's perfect. I do not care about a one bedroom, I eat and sleep in the same room here at my grandfathers already. I'm used to small living quarters."" And I've got some experience with maintenance and some porter work and noticed jobs for apartments needing people.
I have some tools of my own, I can turn over an apartment with some help, I'm not good enough to do it alone yet but I'm not afraid to do work. I still have a lot to learn though. 

I just...I'm hating my life and myself here every passing day and I want to get away from this feeling. I just wish I could pack up and move out there to Denver but I won't get far with what little I have now and I don't have a computer, only this iPhone with a cracked screen. 
I thought I'd maybe post here and see if I could make a friend or just find someone to talk to.

Hey everyone! 

I am an attached female, living with my partner and our two pups. He is very into gaming, board games and video games, and I am very into art of all forms. We share a love for Doctor Who, Adventure Time, A Perfect Circle and music like it, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and weird hats. We are both individually very quirky (Gemini and Aquarian). He is completely sober and always has been, so while I don't drink or smoke around him, I do drink and smoke (420) on occasion. It is important for him to not have those substances used around him. I am 22, and he is 30. 

When I bought my 3 day passes for Comic Con in June, I realized that we are at a point where we don't have any friends close enough to go to con with, or to share a hotel room or anything like that, as we did last year. So, I'm reaching out, looking for some great people to get to know, who might be interested in going to DCC with us and getting to know us. We both really crave having good friends in our lives. 

Shoot me an email and tell me some of your interests, if you've ever been to DCC, and what you might be looking for in a friend.

I'm new to the Denver Area & don't really know many people but I'm hoping I could find some interesting people on here. I'm 21 & all my life I've had a passion for music & performing but was never confident to take it seriously until recently. I've been writing a lot of songs lately & am wanting to find someone or a couple people who know how to play guitar, piano, or keyboard to jam & create with! I'm only interested in people who have a true passion for doing this & want to do it with their time rather than feel like they have to or are obligated to. I love to sing & am always singing so if I could find friends who also love to play instruments or even sing as well I would be really happy to meet & see where our chemistry could take us. Music is something I'll always see myself doing so why not find bad ass musicians & support each other's talents & motivate each other to be better artists & people. It sounds like a huge commitment lol but I want to keep it cool & natural. My musical taste ranges all over, I'm not formally musically educated but I enjoy learning & am open to all styles. My personal styles would probably be pop, jazz, or soul & r&b, even punk. I'm learning what it means to be a vocalists the more I practice & explore my own range. I like to smoke 420 & drink socially but I'm not a partier. You can always reach me by email. Im open to when we get together & I'm hoping this isn't ridiculously long to read! :P 
P.S. I do not play any instruments, but I'm definitely considering buying a guitar & learning.

I'm looking to find a REAL (not spam) guy that needs a friend. Someone who enjoys video games (definite plus), music, movies, and good conversation. Maybe someone who is not looking to change their status, but needs someone to talk to, friendship, maybe even game with, but ultimately nothing beyond anything platonic. Someone to chat with via text/kik or email and preferably someone I click with to chat long term.

Hello!

I am visiting 3/25 through 3/30 and I am looking for someone to show me around. Hopefully we can get to know each other before I get up there to avoid any super awkwardness. I am basically just plopping into town and exploring. Food, culture, sights, burning, hiking and all that touristy shit.

Me - 31 years old originally from New York. 6'5 big friggin guy coming from Jacksonville, Florida. I am intimidating looking just because I'm a giant but I assure you I am a friendly person. Always looking to laugh and smile. I am a professional in my career and college educated. My left arm is sleeved. I am very outgoing and social and like to try different things. I burn on the reg so I am looking to partake in the festivities while up there. I am a bit of a nerd. Marvel comics and anything automobile related is my jam. I love art and almost any type of music.... except country.

You - Fun. Cute. Outgoing. Friendly.

I'm headed up to Denver this weekend to celebrate life and attend a special martial arts class Saturday morning. I'm looking to have some fun and want to meet someone nice to keep me company and do something fun. I'm not too familiar with Denver, and it would be awesome if you know of any events or cool bars or breweries we can hang out at. I'm a tall white guy, 32 years old, 6'5, 205lbs, works out regularly, single, and craves something new. I can be a huge dork at times, but I hear my awkwardness and openness can be very seductive and make for easy fun conversation. I enjoy 420, breweries, comedy, exercise, live music, and would even be up to try something completely outside of my comfort zone. I'll be staying at the Comfort Inn Central. I'm thinking about moving to Denver and I can't imagine a better way to get to know the city than to take someone out for a casual date, or try something wild. Please write me ASAP if you're at all interested and feel free to ask me any questions. It would be great to make a new friend, or just have a fun affair for the weekend.

Hello!

I'll spare you the long version of my story -- until you ask -- but let's just say that for reasons related to my marriage and my divorce, I find myself nearly completely disconnected from the world. I also find my faith waning. I have a couple of good guy friends, but they're married and otherwise occupied most of the time.

I don't really know why I am searching for a woman to buddy up with me for church friend-dates on Saturday. I CAN promise you that I am NOT interested in a physical or romantic relationship. I want a real friend, like I haven't had since I was about twenty-one. I miss sitting in front of one other person, sharing all my bull-s%&t and not being judged. I miss causing myself shame (not really) but having a friend to sit across from me, listen to my story, and share an empathetic look with me. I guess I want a real friend, maybe a bff if we really hit it off.

About me: I'm a 36-year-old divorced father of two who is not looking for romance or intimate connection right now; getting back into the world of the living is where I want to start. I used to play soccer (and would like to still) and wrestle, and I love writing. I have started and gotten fifteen to twenty pages in on about fifty books over the course of my life. I am also a teacher, although I am currently questioning that path. I love to have fun, but I am a hurting soul and am both a little awkward and a little uptight at times. I want to find that happy spark again, and I think having friends, paired with the joy of my children, is the ticket.

Let me know if you live on the west side of town (Arvada, Wheatridge, Littleton, Lakewood, Golden, etc.) and would like to spend part of Saturday evenings worshiping God.

Cheers!

You, were just not satisfied, maybe stuck in a rut in your marriage. Even though you were unhappy, I never got the feeling you were ""on your way out"", but just needed someone to talk to as well. You lived south (postal code a total guess) I know you were south of Denver but north on Monument. We shared our secrets and fears, even talked on the phone a time or two. I wanted to see how you were doing, how your kids turned out (high school / college) and if you ever ever got out of that rut. I wanted to let you know how I was doing and thank you for all your time, energy and kind, life saving words....You kept my head above water when all I wanted to do was sink. If you can tell me what business you had, I'll know it was you! I hope you still read these!

I am looking for a fun lady, a partner in crime, just someone who likes to go out and have fun without any of the pressures of dating. I like to do a lot of things and with summer coming, there are going to be even more things. The only limit I would put is that you should be 50 or over. Personally you can be younger if you want, but I am over and its all about what you are comfortable with. That being said, everything else is negotiable. I do not care about anything else. Its a friend thing. If you feel self conscious about your looks or size then this is perfect for you. All of that judgmental stuff is checked at the door. I am by far not perfect and everyone will be met with a smile. What the heck, give it a shot.

Re-posting this.

Hi my name is Adam. Since this is a CL personal's ad, let me first be clear on one point: I am NOT on here looking for sex. Not now, not down the road once you know me better. If that's what you think friendship is, well there are (and unfortunately from my viewpoint) a lot of posts from people who agree with you. Try them.

Now that that is out of the way, let me tell you a little of who I am and why I AM posting on here. It will be the first time I've done so. I'm posting on here because I believe the world we live in makes deep and intimate human connection difficult and therefore hard to come by, at least for me. Honestly, I don't know how to build a real friendship when for many people, the occasional ""like"" on Facebook or ""LOL"" text message constitutes friendship. That and all the rules that forbid men from getting close to one another physically, emotionally, spiritually, or any other _ally unless they are into homosexuality. Sorry, but I reject both the notions of superficial non-connected friendships as well as the opposite that ""real men"" only interact in fist bumps and bro-hugs and don't actually have any kind of feelings or need for anyone but themselves unless for sex.

What I wish I had right now was a friend, about my age, who feels as deeply about things (and other people) as I do. Who isn't afraid to show it. Who isn't afraid to talk to about hard things, but whom I can also go out and do things with, be real with, have fun with, and feel like said friend desires and values me as a friend as much as I value him. I'll be honest, there are some hard things in my life, some that I haven't completely figured out yet. I wouldn't be on here posting that I need friends if that were not the case. But as I said, I also would love to have another man to just do things with. I like racquetball, ping pong, camping, hiking, volleyball, disc golf. I love conversation, and I don't avoid the difficult topics. But I find that I sit around entirely too much since I haven't found anyone to do any of that with. A little help on that front would be appreciated.

I should also say that I have deep convictions about a lot of things, religious, moral, political to name a few, and am not afraid to discuss those topics, as long as it stays respectful. But those convictions also are a way of life for me. I try my best to actually live according to my beliefs, though I often fail at it. On that note, I don't drink or smoke anything so meeting up for a drink or 420 isn't my thing.

If you likewise want such a friend, I may be your man. Just so you have a little more idea of who I am, I'm 29, from South Carolina, but live in Centennial now (near at least some places in Aurora). I am looking for friends around my age (say 20s to about 35 maybe). Not that I mind older people, I just feel I need a peer more than a mentor. I travel a lot for work, which sadly means I'm sometimes gone for a few days at a time, hence at least part of the hard time finding steady friendships in my life.

I probably am one of the more unusual men you'll ever meet. I guess a man who looks for other men in CL ads for anything other than sex is already a little weird, but hey, you're looking in the platonic section too, so let's be weird together. If you'd like to talk more or meet up, feel free to email back. We can start there.

Greetings Fellas,

New to Denver from the east coast and looking to make some new friends around town - preferably near Capitol Hill or downtown Denver. 

About Me: 
27 years old, full time professional, have a masters degree, love travel, working out, surfing and getting outdoors for some hiking or snowshoeing. I'm also interested in the arts, politics - not a huge sports fan, but like to get out and catch a game every now and then - and having long philosophical talks about life. Have a girlfriend, and not looking for any kind of friends with benefits - just pals! I like to dress well, but don't go overboard about it - basically, I'm a very friendly, active, smart, well dressed, Mr Perfect! Far from it, but Hey, you can try right?

What I'm Looking for: 
Basically, I'm looking for a young guy similar in age, and work situation to me who is also looking to make new friends in Denver. Ideally, you are looking for guy / guys to go hiking with, hang out and grab a few beers on the weekend, watch some Netflix and talk about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I go to Club Form Fitness downtown on 17th and if you also go there and we can put in a workout together - awesome. If you like Bodyspace, but aren't a meat head - we should be friends.

Feel free to reach out on here - send a picture of yourself if you like, or describe yourself if you like, and lets grab a drink or a burger sometime. Always great to meet new people.

My name is Danielle and I'm newly single. I moved out here with my ex and never made any female friends. I need a bestie! Someone that is funny and likes to have a good time no matter what we're doing. A gym buddy would be amazing. Maybe some yoga classes, step classes, or even if we had our own routine! A single friend would be nice because it's difficult to be around couples right now due to the breakup. But if you do have a man no biggie! I'm a full time nanny and I have the weekends off. I'd like to go to the gym after work about 6 pm. Hope I hear from some down to earth ladies!

Seeking my new best friend 
46 year old married female looking for a female friend. My kids are grown and out of the house. I love spending time with my husband but I also need to have some girl time and he is very understanding of that. I don't care if your married or single but if you have to be attached to your hubby at all times this won't work. I'm in search of a best friend that is interested in anything from shopping and working out together to just hanging out, having a couple drinks and watching girly movies. I live away from the city and work in Denver (overnight shift) but am trying to get away from that shift and back to some normalcy. I have a membership at Planet Fitness in Aurora so would love to have someone that is an early riser that would want to go workout or grab a coffee and chat as this is the time I am usually heading home from work. Also like to go boating, camping, dancing, karaoke, gardening, crafts etc. I'm pretty open to activities just really need someone to be my partner in crime because nothing is as much fun alone. If your interested and are looking for something similar let me know and we'll work it out. My only requirement for a new best friend is that you are nonjudgmental, drug and drama free.

Hi, 
Do you like to explore random mountain towns? Strange hot springs and quirky shops? Hiking trails you never knew about? 
What about touring Cave of the Winds, getting some yerba mate in Manitou, and hitting the outlet mall in Castle Rock?
This spring I want to check out Bishop's castle, finally swim at the Eldorado pool in Boulder, and at last take a tour of the Celestial Seasonings plant and Coors brewery!
There's a quirky little museum downtown that I want to check out as well. It's called the Kirkland Museum. Cheap to get in and I love mid mod furniture and things of that nature. I've never been but heard good things! 

So I'm not into video games, smoking, comics, or other typical dorky stuff but I am a goofball who is into:
exercise
mtn biking
hiking
exploring
concerts and movies
art walk/first Friday
indie music 
indie films
comedy shows
Mopeds!!!
FUN!!!
So, if any of that sounds like a good time shoot me a response, maybe with some ideas of your own. Springs on it's way and I'm stoked for the weather to turn warm.
And..... I really do like mopeds.

Hello all,
I have posted before seeking a friend to talk to that is in the same situation as I am in. I am a positive person and am finally past the worst part of my divorce. What is left is a person that might be insecure when they never have been before...may feel a bit lost when they have been grounded their entire life....or miss just talking about their day to someone. 
What I have found so far? Women that ask for a pic upfront as if they are only responding to my post for future dating purposes...women that so desperate to 'hook up' that they don't want to get to know someone as a friend...women that only respond with 3 word answers when you write a paragraph. 
After my divorce, the last thing I want is to go into the dating pool...sex is the last thing on my mind...and if you can't put together a friendly discussion via email, why would you even reply? I don't give a damn if you climb 14ers or teach a yoga class. I could care less about your serial dating habits...
All I seek is a true human being that is not hung up with their ex, doesn't mind talking...really talking about what is happening in their lives...and would like to slowly learn more about someone that could become a lifelong friend. Is that a too much to ask?

Cheers! :)

I'm looking to find someone to text with! I am looking for a texting or kik female friend basically just keep each other company thru messaging. If you're concerned about discretion, the only people that ever need to know is you and me, and I can completely disappear if that's what you need.

My information: 38, married, white, tall, brownish hazel eyes, educated, and professionally employed.

Who I'm looking for: 20 to 50 (not a hard limit), any race, single or taken (I won't judge and, like I said, no one is as discreet as me), capable of carrying on a conversation (intelligence and a quick wit isn't always found only with educated people), able to be relaxed, and loves to laugh and make others laugh too. I'm relatively flexible on all of this (so few things can be broken down to black and white decisions), so don't be afraid just to message me to say hi if you're curious.

If you do message me, I will answer. I'm not out to sell something, I'm not a picture collector, I'm not a flake who won't follow through. No silent blow offs and no BS from me, I'm exactly who and what I say I am.

For the most part, this cuddling will be generally platonic- and under no circumstances will there ever be any request or expectation of nudity, or anything that could be described using the word ""job"". Outside of that, I'd like some potential for boundaries to be flexible within those non-negotiables. My initial impression (for a first session) is something along the lines of us laying on my couch, with a blanket over us, snuggled up in front of my wood burning fire place. We'll be wearing comfortable clothes (flannel pants and tshirts/tank tops?). I'll be the ""big spoon"" and will hold you in my muscular arms with quiet, chill music playing. We'll talk politics, relationships, the human condition... or just quietly hum along with the music. 

You are welcome to keep in contact via phone with whomever you need consistently throughout our cuddling session. I'm not against the idea of you having a friend waiting for you. I'm really looking for someone who can cuddle with me once or twice a month, for a few hours, for a flat rate of $200/cash. 

Here's where I invite questions and concerns about my post, my intentions or my reasoning for offering money for this. Questions about sexual favors won't be entertained or discussed. What I can say is this- this is really about affection and relaxation. The closeness of a man and a woman in this context definitely implies some degree of sexuality. Let's figure that out, but once again... no ""jobs"" and no nudity and no touching anything that is covered with underwear.... I think that makes things easier to figure, now.

Anyway, at this point I'm rambling. I think my intent and integrity are yours to question. 

To get an immediate reply- please include a pic or two (fully clothed, one that gives an idea of your body type), and some return contact info. I've included a phone number that takes text messages, so that is available as well.

Oh, Princess Bride. Maybe that dates me. 
Attached early 40s man seeks mature, intelligent woman for discreet friendship via email that could develop into more, but who knows. I have no expectations. 
I'm good with my life, and you should be too ... other than the possibility of needing a private friendship because, perhaps, you're a little disillusioned with matrimony. Maybe you need to vent, and that's fine. 
I'm fit, educated, literate, kind, thoughtful, nonjudgmental, very open minded, flirty, and - other than being a married guy on CL - not a creep. I enjoy the outdoors, music, the occasional 420, and whatever is fun.

I have a number of close female friends, and unquestionably prefer the company of women to men in most cases. But once, just once, I'd love to find a highly compatible female companion who, like me, is tall (5' 9"" and up) and slender -- someone who relates to what that means in terms of doorways, buying a car, or finding properly fitting jeans or long-enough sleeves. (If you smiled when you read that, you should probably consider getting in touch. :))

Open as far as age is concerned (I'm mid 50s, but don't look it, feel it, live it or get taken for it, ever). Prefer someone caucasian, cute/attractive, at least reasonably fit, intelligent, thoughtful, joyful, well read, upbeat/optimistic, open minded, easygoing, balanced, great sense of humor, an excellent conversationalist, self-aware (as opposed to self-absorbed), and eternally curious about the world around her. Being health-conscious, semi- to fully vegetarian, spiritually inclined (as opposed to 'religious'), at least somewhat liberal politically, and a lover of nature, the outdoors, travel, and the written word would be major pluses.

Obviously I too am tall (6' 2"") and slender (165), as well as single, caucasian, clean cut and clean shaven, fit, attractive, casually professional, with most/all of the characteristics referenced in the paragraph above. Oh, and I don't smoke (not even 420) or use any kind of drug, and would prefer that you not either. Living relatively close to one another would seem wise too in this case, as I think of it.

This being Craigslist, I realize it's unlikely the friend I seek can be found here. Then again, I suspect there are many like me who have never posted or responded to a post before because they've viewed the ads on CL, many quite off-putting, and are convinced no one they'd care to know could ever be found here...

Sometimes in life, you find a special friend. Someone who changes your life just by being part of it. Someone who makes you laugh until you can't stop. Someone who makes you believe that there really is good in the world. Someone who convinces you that there really is an unlocked door just waiting for you to open it. This is forever friendship. When you're down and the world seems dark and empty, your forever friend lifts you up in spirit and makes that dark and empty world suddenly seem bright and full. Your forever friend gets you through the hard times, the sad times an dthe confused times. If you turn and walk away, your forever friend follows. If you lose your way, your forever friend guides you and cheers you on. Your forever friend hold your hand and tells you that everything is going to be okay. And if you find such a friend, you feel happy and complete because you need not worry. You have a forever friend, and forever has no end. Text me 21nine218nine35two

I appreciate the perspective and understanding the female mind has to offer, which is why I am writing this post. I love conversation as it pertains to life, eternity, health, relationships and other topics of importance.

A couple of other details about myself, I fix bikes as a job, I am Hispanic and I have long hair, I am studying to be a person trainer.

Do you have a desire to feel more at ease with life, no matter what is going on?

Having your Bars run can do just that. There are 32 points on your head that correspond to things like; healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named.

They store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything.

For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called ""money.""

Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it, clearing the space for new awareness to come in.

The creative possibilities for your life begin to open up!

It's been said that at worst a Bars session will feel like a great massage. At best, it will change your life!

Hello,
I am seeking to do a massage trade with a younger attractive fit female who needs and enjoys a good massage session. 
I'm not looking to hook up or looking for sex or drama. I am just wanting an attractive honest girl who loves the benefits of a good fun massage. 
I am an attractive, nice, kind, clean, and fit white man and look much younger than 55. 
I am looking for a mutual trade either switch off every week during the same session. You don't have to be a profession massage person, since I'm not either. I have been told that I give a great massage. I have had trade partners before and everybody wins with a nice trade. This can be at your home or mine. I am located in a nice house in the central metro area. So if you love a full body massage and think you could trade in return. Even beginners will do fine. I'm open to all trades.
Please send your age, recent photos, telephone, and time to call. Thank you.

I am looking for somewhat of an ongoing thing; if you just want to talk just for a day or so, please let me know in advance. 

(I am posting in the Strictly Platonic section because there will be no meetings and no actual sex)

Would you like an online chat buddy?

I am looking for someone to chat with through email. We could talk about anything interesting, but I would like there to be some flirting, innuendo, and even some back-and-forth dirty chatting, if you're interested, but no pressure. There will be no pressure for actual sex, only online encounters. This will give us both the freedom to share whatever we want, without fear of embarassment.

You can share pictures without face, if you feel comfortable, but not required. Total anonymity is the goal.

I would like you to have a sense of humor, be articulate, and not be self-absorbed or rude. I would want us to both be free to share stories, fantasies, or whatever without judgement from the other person. I do have limits on what I will not talk about.

I am only looking for sane, stable, non-married people.

I prefer 21-40 year old physically fit people, but that is not an absolute requirement.

If you would like to have this type of online encounter, maybe allow your inner sexual personality to come out a bit, then email me. Change the subject line to your favorite color to eliminate spam. When responding, please tell me a little about yourself; short responses like ""hey"" will probably not get a reply.

Are you stuck?

What if working out and proper nutrition was more than just a Means to
lose weight and get into shape?

What if it was a catalyst to shifting your life?

In my years as a trainer I have noticed one amazing thing about
purposeful movement and good nutrition. It gives people to confidence
to do amazing things with their lives!

People step up into better engagement in their jobs, relationships, in their lives!
Of course a healthier body shows up along for the ride, but are you ready to really shift your life?

How about a complementary exploratory session to see what is possible?

Hi there, I hope you're staying warm on this snowy day. I'm a 34 year old married guy who is looking to add someone new and special to my life. I can't leave the situation that I'm in... But I miss the excitement and comfort of really being attracted to someone. I'm looking for long term and serious. Now that word tends to throw people off so let me explain what I mean...

By serious I just mean real. I'm a real person on the end of this conversation, as are you! If things click I will think of you often, and think of ways to make you happy, as I would any partner in my life. I will light up inside when I see a message arrive from you, I want to trade pictures often ( naughty, nice and everything in between), I will genuinely want to know how your day was... A real relationship to me doesn't mean you need to leave your spouse, fly across the world and ever meet me. It just means we're in this together...

If you've made it this far..let me tell you a bit about me... I'm attractive(handsome and cute are what I'm told), 6' tall, 172lbs, athletic build, brown hair and eyes and love my body, very sexual and open to all sorts of kinks, open and honest, funny (at least I think so!), and generally worth getting to know.

I'm into hockey, football, hiking, biking, cooking, music, and movies. I'm intelligent and want to meet someone who will talk about anything and everything and will reply in complete sentences most of the time (I'll let it slide in the throes of passion when we're both about to cum together after a long session of dirty talk though...)

If you think you can handle all of this and I haven't scared you away, shoot me a message and we'll go from there.

Can we be each other's fun escape?

I've met a few cool people via Craigslist in the past, so I figured it was worth a shot to write my own ad so I can describe myself and the type of people I'm hoping to meet. If you are a flaky person who claims you want new friends but is never going to want to do anything other than be a hermit, please do not waste my time. 

To keep it brief, I'm looking for friends around my age who don't have kids and are fairly active. No offense to you if you have kids, but I have enough friends with them who can never commit to plans. If you're married/in a relationship, that's cool too, since maybe we can all hang out. I'm not looking for smoking buddies or people who only want to get together if it involves eating/drinking/sitting at a bar. I'll go to a happy hour on random occasions but I'm not a big drinker and would rather get to know someone by doing something fun instead of sitting at a noisy bar with a bunch of sloppy people. 

My husband and I try to go hiking as much as possible, but it's day hiking type stuff - I'll never be camping in a tent for a week because I have a screwed up back. I'm trying to motivate myself to get back into running since I like 5Ks, and haven't been running much since we moved to CO last year. The dry air still kills me even though I will never miss the humidity of the East Coast! I'm sarcastic, honest, analytical, and a fairly type A person. I consider myself introverted but I like meeting new people on an individual basis. I love zoos, baking and traveling as much as humanly possible. I need independent friends who aren't reliant on their husbands/boyfriends/whoever and like to do new things. 

I do live outside of Colorado Springs on the NE side, but am hoping there are some women on the southern side of Denver that might be in the same boat since I have no issue with driving or meeting in between. I've been here for a little over a year and have yet to meet many people I click with, so maybe you're reading this right now...and if you are, email me and let's talk!

I don't want to change anyone's home life or cause any drama so I will offer respect and privacy/discretion (of course).

Hey there!
I'm a 20 year old tattooed goth who is lacking in the friend department. I've got two beautiful cats and I live with my partner. I'm a little shy starting out but I come around pretty quickly. Love makeup and fashion and trying new food. I'm a home body and I really enjoy relaxing at home, smoking, talking, gaming, etc. I also enjoy going out to concerts or clubs every once in a while. 

I enjoy going on nature walks/hikes and exploring Colorado. I'm pretty spiritual(anti-religion) and am an eclectic witch personally, I can tell you more about that if you'd like. I'd also love to explore Colorado's paranormal side.

I just really want to make some new friends, around my age (Please nobody over 25, preferably someone dark/goth), who are fun and don't expect too much. Someone who's chill and loves to smoke and hangout at home or get dressed up and go out to do whatever! I drink occasionally, and do drugs whenever a friend or acquaintance happens to get me some. When I say smoking I only mean weed, in case you were wondering :)

Friend requirements: Must smoke weed, must enjoy horror movies, must despise christianity and all things surrounding it 110%

If you think we'd get along, and you'd like to hangout sometime, send me an email and we'll go from there :) I'd love a photo of you as well, nothing romantic or sexual please. Put 'black as your soul' in the title so that I know you read it all.

So I have been debating weather or not to post here or keep hoping that I come across a post that really interest me. Obviously I chose to be proactive. What I am looking for is someone to call a friend. Someone I can hang with and have some fun. A little about me, I'm 32, have a wife of 4.5 years although we have been together for about 16 years now. I also have a son who just turned 5 a few days ago. I have a great M-F job so I get nights and weekends to do whatever my heart desires. I enjoy being out in nature just as much as I enjoy being inside playing cards or video games or just having good conversation over a cup of coffee. I am a bit of an introvert so meeting people outside of work has been somewhat challenging. Things that I am passionate about are cars (working on them, racing them, etc.), 420, golf and cooking just to name a few. So I guess what I am looking for out of this post is to find someone like minded or have similar inerests. I would consider myself bi/curious and would like to form a strong bond or bromance and maybe let our curiosities come to fruition. I just think it would be great to find a friend that would come over to hang out and maybe cook up some grub, play some games and have some guy time to let a little loose. I have played with myself and have some experience with that but i have the desire to try things that i cant do to myself. Message me if you feel like maybe we could hit it off or if you have any questions that I didn't address. I will just describe what I look like and maybe respond to some of you with pictures.

I'm seeking a carefree, fun, neat, considerate, preferably female, 20something roommate(s). I'd be open to living in RiNo, Wash Park, Cap Hill or Uptown (in that order). Ideally I would love to have a solid relationship with my roommate -- maybe have movie and wine nights on occasion or work out together -- whatever is your thing. Establishing trust and having good communication is important. I already have a lot of living room furniture so it would be ideal if you didn't.

Hi.. hope you're having a nice evening. are you interested in being a part of a human experiment? I am in my early 40's .. if ur judging me already this won't work. I'm hsv positive, a social drinker, and seeking someone open minded. 

I am a firm believer that if a person is a ""4"" or ""5"" in looks but has a great personality & we share some chemistry he would be a great catch. However what I ""see"" right now is tainted. is it possible for 2 people who haven't seen pictures of each other to share feelings for each other purely based on chemistry & commonalities or will I forever be burdened with seeking what only appeals to me visually yet does not meet my emotional & intellectual needs??? ;)

Hello wonderful land of cl. Im looking for people to talk with. I enjoy the conversation of others and would like to help pass the boredom. 

About me:

Let me just say that if you are looking for that drop dead gorgeous blonde with a slim figure...that's not me. I dont think a friend status should come with what a person looks like. Yes i consider myself attractive...most of the time. Ive got a few pounds that i wish would go away but hey thats part of me. Im ok with that. Im a great listener and love talking if the right subject is brought up. No i wont discuss politics or religion. That wont be much of a convo but more of a heated argument. I wont go there. Sorry guys im not big into sports. Cant hold that much convo about that subject but im willing to try if you really want. Other then that...im open to ideas. I have a sense of humor and i dont take offense easily. I can be a smartass and i will make jokes that only i find funny. Im not looking for a relationship or anything. Just good conversation. I dont care your situation as long as you dont lie about it. I dont want to be the cause of drama. The only thing i ask is be around my age. I dont have much in common with older and younger. Im 32. 

Your pic will get mine. Please change the subjec so i know you're not spam. Thanks for reading.

He is an Air Force veteran who now works an odd work schedule out of state, and I am in the admin field We are both professionals, ddf (drug, drama free), and an every day average family! We are proffesionals, homeowners, but fun!

""Simple, no frills, down to earth Tauruian guy!""

Actually I'm a workaholic. I keep really busy and have no real social life. I read more than I watch TV, listen to all genres of music, am pretty open minded about the world and the people in it, been around the globe three times during my military career but still have lots more to see. I'm not afraid to try new things and am a Colorado native (which just sounds wrong coming from a white boy) and hail from the Western Slope. I love this state, and not just here for the 420 fest, but I also don't judge those that are. 

""Welcome to Colorful Colorado""

I'm looking to get out more, though I do enjoy my internet friends, it's not enough for me. I love my work, but don't like mixing my business life with my social one...two seperate worlds for me. I love to laugh and love comedies. I like laid back chill women, so, no drama please! I like happy, positive, fun people that are comfortable in thier own skin. Oh ya, and laughing, lots and lots of laughing!

I'm former military and a combat infantry veteran. I'm missing a leg below the knee but keep active and get around well. I don't always think about it or remember to tell people, but it does need to be disclosed up front for all the shallow Val's out there...
...so there it is, my ""catfish"" discloser! 

I'm still a man and enjoy the company of positive open minded women who love good food with wine, good times indoors or out, great entertainment and laughs, like to travel even if only a day trip or at least the thought of it. Oh ya, did I mention laughing? So important in a friendship.

I'm not looking for anything more than a platonic (friends only) relationship. I'm not good at intimacy or opening up my heart to be chewed up and spat out or even at being a casual fwb...not what I'm into or good at. But if you want to go out, have a good time, laugh, enjoy yourself without any weird sexual pressures or awkwardness, then I'm your guy. 

Interests include:

Travel, Sci-Fi, comedy, gardening, veterans affairs, conservation, sustainable life styles, simple things in life, volunteering, being kind and compassionate, art, life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness...just to name some to get conversations going.

And it is ok to send me a message first, I'm not stuck up.

Sometimes in life, you find a special friend. Someone who changes your life just by being part of it. Someone who makes you laugh until you can't stop. Someone who makes you believe that there really is good in the world. Someone who convinces you that there really is an unlocked door just waiting for you to open it. This is forever friendship. When you're down and the world seems dark and empty, your forever friend lifts you up in spirit and makes that dark and empty world suddenly seem bright and full.

Hi, I'm looking to find a chubby girl/woman between the ages of 24-40 to start a new friendship with. Ideally you'd be a nerdy type who's more comfortable at home in sweatpants playing video games and browsing Craigslist than bar hopping. Also a huge plus if you enjoy smoking weed and making stupid jokes.

My best friend is moving out of state and admittedly I'm worried it's going to get lonely around here. I live by myself and soon I think I'll really want a buddy to smoke and chat with. Everything is more fun with company, right?

I don't care if you're single or in a relationship or if you have kids or whatever other baggage we build up as we get older. I'm just looking for a pleasant person to pass the time with. In your initial response tell me what brings your to browse Craigslist and include a picture, if you're comfortable with that.

They have to meet anyone I leave the house with and won't let me leave by myself. The truth is sometimes I need some time to myself and I just don't want to rock the boat before I leave.

I'd like to find someone willing to come in for seriously like 5 minutes, meet them, and then leave with me. The whole thing would probably take like 10 minutes. Must have car.

Hey everyone.

Moved here just over a year ago and have found it surprisingly difficult to make genuine friends. So I figured I would give this a try.

So. A little about me: 28yo guy. Educated with a great job that I am passionate about. People tend to say I am very laid back and easy to be around. Am a bit of an introvert though. I am in a long term relationship with my boyfriend (I am gay) so I am not looking for anything more than friends. He is just the only person I know here and would love to meet some new people! I am pretty masculine for a gay dude and tend to get along with all sorts of people...When it is nice out I prefer to be outside. I hike with my dog or bike almost every weekend and am looking to explore other outdoor activities. Also going out for dinner or drinks is fun. Or juts staying in with Netflix. I do smoke weed sometimes when I don't have anything to do. Or at the end of an active day. Anyways hit me back up with a little about yourself and maybe we can meet up and do something!

Hey there,

I'm just looking to meet a few people and hopefully make a new friend who live close by. It's getting harder and harder as the years tick by.

I'm technically in Littleton. My major intersection is S. Wadsowrth and Bowles. Right by the Southwest Plaza Mall. I would really like to find a few guys who live close by; makes it easier to hit up and do something.

I like to consider myself a pretty chilled out guy. I work for myself so I set my own schedule.
I get up in the morning, head to the gym, come home, work, go out on impromptu hikes if the weather is nice, play video games or watch movies in the evenings, read books, write, play music, rinse and repeat.

Tried skiing for the first time this year and it hurt. I need more practice but hopefully will get better.

I smoke recreationally and that is something you should probably be okay with. If you're in to it, happy to share. 

Very big on the outdoors in the summer. Planning on doing a few 14'ers and backpacking trips. Would like to visit and camp out in Utah. Would like to explore more of what Colorado has to offer as I want to get back in to photography this year. Such a great state for it, too.

If you're interested in getting to know me, just tell me about yourself and what you like to do. :)

I've posted on this site previously with no luck but I thought I would give it another try. I'm looking for other men that like to hang around naked, someone who is as comfortable out of their clothes as they are in their clothes. I don't care what you look like just as long as you're comfortable in your own body. The only real requirement that I have is that you be at least my age or older. Please send a picture of yourself along with a brief description of you with your response. This is NOT an ad for sex but I am not oposed to playing around if we are both comfortable with each other. I AM NOT 420 FRIENDLY SO DON'T EVEN ASK.

Looking for a clubbing friend, mostly Milk, but I am open to other places notably Lipgloss. Also wouldnt mind learning swing dance or really any kind of dance. A kind Cl responder suggested it. I have done Salsa all of once, had alot of fun at La Rumba but was hilariously bad at it!

I am married, so yes this is platonic. Unlike most of the females posting ads, platonic doesnt mean give me free stuff or romantic relationship at my convenience.

I just want to dance with a friend and sadly hollywoods lied to me saying all women love dancing and all straight men hate it.

Tired of going alone, and tired of drink ho's asking for drinks, its been a while but one can never be UN-tired of drink hos.

I do possess a mohawk, and I workout so Im fit. Still trying to lose those last 10lbs, but there isnt a workout for my overly inflated ego. Yeah, totally take myself seriously. :-).

Im also available for coffee houses! I like chai

Should I say, no pic no reply like the F4M platonic section? Sounds kinda harsh, but equality is a thing and I want us to be equals.....

Hi there, I'm David. I'm a 30 yr old male born and raised in Colorado. First, a little about what I'm looking for....

I'm basically just interested in meeting new people in various ways. Everything from friends to hang out with, people to do arts with, a woman to love, or even a couple to become close with. I'm very open minded and am interested in getting out and experiencing new parts of life. I would love to find someone to personally connect with, but am also open to NSA fun with someone if it were to happen that way.

Now for a little about myself...

I am a very open, honest, and positive person. I enjoy many aspects of life, but really have a passion for arts. Especially photography and music. I enjoy the outdoors, and try to get out as much as possible! I love to hike and backpack or anything that gets me into nature. I am not really religious, but am very spiritual. I have a 5 year old son that lives with his mother that I adore dearly and see around twice a week. 

I work currently as a Real Time Analyst at a call center. In short, I basically make sure other people are working. :-P I'd like to get into the photography and music full time soon, and have been working on making that happen. I'd like to work for myself and not someone else! :-)

Well I hope this was enough information to give you an idea of who I am. Feel free to contact me for any reason you may choose. Keep in mind, I will be very blunt and honest. I'm sure I'll get tons of weirdos and spam from this, so I will be pretty critical weeding out the reals and fakes. ;-)

Text is easiest. 3oh3 Three3Zero 0847 If you email, please leave an email to reply to, I seem to get 8 million inquiries that I'm unsure if they ever even end up getting my reply. It's like CL's email relay is messed up or something.... Will get back to you ASAP.

It has been written that you learn best via teaching others. So I would like to teach some others random things about dating and maybe learn a few new things in the process or have a few laughs about humans. I've been dating quite a long while, in between some long healthy relationships. Also have been studying psychology and sociology for many years. At this point I'm not confused or surprised by much. 

Presently open to some random conversation. So hit me up to find out why your dating profiles on okc pof etc, or posts here are not working. Or things like the time tested question of what the fuck was he thinking, etc.

I have been divorced for 7 years now and find my life revolving around work. Having no kids and all my friends being married with kids I find myself alone unless at work.

Being alone is great some of the time but this feeling has been growing and growing. With me getting older I just want to find a friend to hang out with, be a confidant and someone to just be honest about how I feel. Someone who can be honest with me giving their opinion good or bad. I don't judge others as I don't want to be judged. My life is far from perfect and I have done my fare share of stupid but as they say live and learn. I have without doubt grown from my mistakes and learn to be a better man.

I am looking to develope some sort of friendship and or community support person. I was homeless for a year and ended up getting caught with a weapon without a permit and now in a halfway house. I'd rather be upfront and honest with no responses than open up the gift of Gabe and get many non foundational responses. You get the point. I work full time and trying to get through my program. I don't have anyone here in Denver that will facilitate my needs as far as program requirements. I'm also looking for anything that helps being they won't let me have any of my own money yet. Things in terms mostly hygiene and little things to help survive. I'm looking for a friendship but not closed minded to future opportunities. I'm 6ft 220 blues eyes and a personality that's greater than not less than. I am real I'm in the 80022 zip code by Sapp bros. I'm open to suggestions as well and will consider all things beneficial to not only my needs but yours too. Thanks for reading,

Hi,

Long story short, I'd like to go to a nudist colony. I'm a single man and have some body image issues and have heard exposure therapy can work well. 

I don't want to go alone as a male, so would love to find a female friend/acquaintance to go with that would make it more comfortable than just a single male going to a resort. 

I'm 37, white, educated, fun and easy going.

Hi, Thank you so very much for looking at my ad. I am a bit lonely but only for good friends with time. I have people around me like family. Many of my friends are busy with their families. I generally just want to be nice and get that back. 

Hoping for above average intellect, so I can learn from friends and hopefully vise versa. One liners are unlikely to get a response. Seriously, not into a day or two of small talk. I see it taking a month or more of talking/emailing to get to know if we are a friend match? Long term friendship is preferred. 

You can only get to know someone by getting to know them, in my opinion. If you think your looks will deter me, they won't. I don't need to know your height, weight or how tall you are. That is not who you are. :)

That raw desire you have when meeting and feeling that attraction in your stomach. If after another drink we decide to enjoy each other company further that is to be decided then not now. 
If after that first night we never meet again , we had that one night! and SA la Vie ...
Maybe we meet again or not however things may be will be but to meet a new person, being honest of what you are looking for and the possibility of finding it , if even for just a day or even an hour what a thought. 
Want more out of live and feel trapped in the world I live in. No escape exists for me to today , so I am making this my escape. The possibilities are endless and I don't judge as I do not want to be judged. I am not a game so don't play me and you wont be played, I am honest , maybe to much so as you can read but at least my escape is now a reality.

Hi,

Thanks for taking the time to read my post. For some time now, it's been clear my circle of friends has grown smaller, and those I do have are shifting. I am feeling less connected than many years ago when we began our friendship. Though they are dear to me, I am finding myself longing for a connection with another who values not only intellect, attending to physical body's needs (e.g. exercise, sustenance) but also has a desire to be better than he is today. I am seeking someone who finds gratitude in the smallest of things (e.g. the sunshine, the water, the contributions others have made to his life) and wants to share in that kindling of a new friendship to create new opportunities of gratitude and sharing

A little bit more about me: Single, blk, gay (though you do not have to be), 41. I like intimate coffee talks and smaller venues to get to know others, non-drug user, non-smoker to include 420, rarely drink. I also enjoy reading specifically books on dreams, hiking, exercise, good company, good movies. I find that for me it's not about the activities but the people I share those activities with that determine if I am having a good time.

Who I would like to meet: people with life experiences that have strengthened them but have also provided them with humility, those who know there is more to life than just the daily grind, those looking to connect with quality individuals and have their lives bettered for knowing another human in the world, those who have a great sense of humor but is also kind in their humor, and those who can challenge me to being a better person as I will challenge them out of my commitment to support others in being the best they can.

If interested, please say hello. Until our paths cross, I wish you all the best life has to offer.

I'm missing something in my relationship, I'm not quite sure what it is. It's not sex, it's not attention. The closest I can come to is I'm missing support and affection. Perhaps you're missing these things. Perhaps you're missing something else. It doesn't matter entirely, the point is that you and I are here to support each other and to comfort each other, listen to each other's frustrations. Neither you or I are looking to change our situations. In fact I'm here to support your relationship and you are mine. That being said you and I must be discreet, let's chat, maybe meet for a coffee and situation dependent we're open to something occasional physical (although this isn't the key point it can help with forging a bond and support each other).

I'm 32, Ph.D. educated. Great conversationalist. Kind and understanding. I'm a great guy. I'm also tall dark and handsome,lol.

Hi people,

38 yo T-girl, I work from home late nights and I don't really get out much

Usually when I'm off work I like going fast, and when I spin I get pretty chatty

Problem is I tend to be awake when most everyone I know is asleep,

So basically looking for just fun friendly conversation, not looking for anything sexual AT ALL.

Ok I'm making a change to this part of the ad, it used to say ""if sexual chat happens later I won't discourage it"". But no, now I WILL discourage it. Silly me I was under the impression that people would understand ""later"" to mean ""perhaps after a couple of weeks or months of chatting, after we get to know each other as human beings, if if happens at all"" but I forgot on Craigslist, ""later"" means they'll say ""hi, how are you"" first before jumping into sex chat.

Do people even know what ""strictly platonic"" means or do they just not care?

I'm a bit of a geeky artistic type, love to draw, paint, love classical music theater ballet that kind of stuff.

Not looking to meet up cause as I said I don't get out much (not a total shut in or anything just really more of a homebody)

Women, both cis and trans will go to the front of the line but guys, if you're cool I'll chat with you too

If I sound interesting, go ahead and respond to this ad or feel free to contact me on kik my name there is jessicarvn

My kids are grown and gone and now I'm looking for friends to get out and enjoy life with. I am single and looking to meet people in a similar situation (single with kids that are older, not little ones)

Here's a list of things I'm interested in. Some of these I may not be currently doing but would like to.
I'm a few extra pounds but I still like to stay active so I enjoy biking, hiking, other outdoor actives, and the gym, all at a novice pace.
Jet skiing, snow mobiling, fishing, rafting, live music (r&b), comedy clubs, getting out once in awhile (need to flirt with men somewhere), movies, dinner, casinos, bbqs, Broncos, etc.

Having similar personalities is important in making friends so a little bit more about me.
I date all ethnicities.
I'm a democrat.
I mostly listen to r&b
I'm completely straight and only looking for friends.

I'm introverted by nature, I take great comfort in my privacy and I find silence to be a bliss. Needless to say, I love being alone. I detest loud places and loud people. Once or twice a week I enjoy the company of a friend and nothing makes me happier than having someone to constantly email back and forth with or to have a conversation over Skype at the end of the day.

I'm not anti-social and I'm far from shy. At a glance I might come off as a welcome mat with the patience of a saint; fortunately that is not the case. I simply don't care about anything as a result nothing ever gets to me. I'm being deported next year and I can't decide whether I want a 3 piece charcoal suit or a rust / burgundy sport coat and some really nice shoes. When my grandfather passed away, that entire day I couldn't help but wonder if I left the stove on before leaving the house. 

From my perspective, an ideal day starts off with reading random articles online, followed by a workout secession in a non crowded gym, cooking a new exotic recipe for dinner and ending with watching a good movie in front of my monitor.

I have two amazing friends who I have great respect for, unfortunately most of the time they feel more like acquaintances due to the lack of ever wanting to spend time on weekends or talk or email during the weekdays. In short, I have no friends. I'm sure If I had friends they would give me a catchy nick name like Rooster, not many people call me Rooster, in fact no one calls me Rooster, it's depressing. 

I don't need sex but I always welcome it, I'm always in the mood. I get an escort every week, I always pick one with short hair, preferably one that can pull off the tomboy look. Sometimes I pick a guy with a feminine complexion and long hair. 

If you're a lesbian we'll get along just swell, if you're a straight women then it's only a matter of time before I offer you a couple thousand to sleep with me - it's landed me in jail before, so with all due respect I will go to great lengths to avoid you. If you're a bisexual guy then you might just be a potential candidate for best friend. Please note: I don't sleep with my male friends. Above all be under 25 years of age. 

If you have any questions, soliloquies, grievances, death threats, what ever it may be please don't hesitate to ask. DO NOT send me a picture of yourself, otherwise I will judge you and end up ignoring you. I will reply to all and any emails with in the same day. 

The picture I posted is a painting I saw at the Denver museum of art, the piece captured my attention in a way most porn can't. Despite the dark image it depicts, I find it to be beautiful.

There's a new social nudist group in Denver for younger nudists or guys who might be interested. 

I'm 31, white active and fit. I've been a nudist for 10 years. I love the bonding and brotherhood aspect. Our group is focused on young men under 45. 

I've formed a group on Meetup called Denver young men's nudist brotherhood. Look it up on there or shoot me an email. 

The group is all about naked parties, game nights, drinking watching a game or whatever. Just laid back activities at a private home where we just chill naked. Open to all sexualities since it's not a sex group. But tantric massage or edging could be possibilities for gatherings. Cool with 420. 

So if you're a nudist, naturalist, exhibitionist or wanted to try it but couldn't find dudes your age this group is for you.

Hello, and thank you for taking the time to view my ad. I am wanting to move to the big island of Hawaii. I want to live off-grid, complete with water catchment, solar power, grow a completely organic year around garden and orchard. I also have a deep desire to help others in some way. Not sure how that will end up being. But I can definitely see giving away fruit from the orchard that I couldn't possibly consume on my own. I would also like to produce tea tree oil for it's homeopathic benefits.

I was originally going to move to Hawaii with my soon to be ex-wife, and daughter. But they changed their minds, so now I am on my own in this adventure. Which I am fine with. I just wanted to put this out there. In case there is someone out there that is like minded, that would like to join forces in something like this. As I tend to believe where two or more are gathered with the same intents and purposes, real magic can happen. So this is basically a test for echo. (Yes I am a Rush fan.)

So a little about me. I am a 46 year old male. I am not gay, bi, or remotely curious. Just so that is clear right from the start. As I would not be opposed to joining forces with another man that may have interest in the same thing. As long as we are like minded, and can work as a team. I am very spiritual, and believe full heatedly in signs and synchronicities. So much so, that they pretty much lead me in my life. So if you can't handle crazy synchronicities going on around you all of the time, I am definitely not the right person for you to team up with. 

I am also a musician/singer/song writter. I mostly play the keyboards/piano now. So if you wouldn't like listening to me play around 3 times a week. This probably wouldn't be a good fit either. (I don't want to have to use headphone all of the time.) A fellow musician would be great! I am dealing with some health issues currently, that I am hoping I will be able to get past. But typically I am a very athletic person. Love playing several different sports. Like to garden, be out in nature, etc.. 

Very mild mannered. I hate to argue, tension, negativity, etc.. I do not like to watch a lot of violence, or listen to angry/negative music, etc.. I like being in a positive uplifting atmosphere overall. My mantra is to become pure positive energy. The law I live by, is Do No Harm. More specifically, don't harm other people spiritually, emotionally, physically, or financially. If we can agree to live by that together, and communicate effectively whenever any issues do come up. Coming from a place, where we have a trust that the other person would never do anything to harm the other intentionally. That in my opinion, is a rock hard foundation to build any relationship on. 

But I am ready for a transition in my life, I am ready to live my life the way I have wanted to live it for a long time. I want to better myself, and become the best person that I can be. So if you feel like you are ready for a break from the craziness that is our society, and maybe create a little piece of Heaven here on Earth with me. Please let me know, I would love to compare notes, etc., to find a good fit. I could use a life long friend, could you be it? Especially if you have a desire to help others.

Thank you for your time, and consideration,
Dan

I've been writing a lot of songs lately & am wanting to find someone or a couple people who know how to play guitar, piano, or keyboard to jam & create with! I'm only interested in people who have a true passion for doing this & want to do it with their time rather than feel like they have to or are obligated to. I love to sing & am always singing so if I could find friends who also love to play instruments or even sing as well I would be really happy to meet & see where our chemistry could take us. Music is something I'll always see myself doing so why not find bad ass musicians & support each other's talents & motivate each other to be better artists & people. It sounds like a huge commitment lol but I want to keep it cool & natural. My musical taste ranges all over, I'm not formally musically educated but I enjoy learning & am open to all styles. My personal styles would probably be pop, jazz, or soul & r&b, even punk. I'm learning what it means to be a vocalists the more I practice & explore my own range. I like to smoke 420 & drink socially but I'm not a partier. You can always reach me by email. Im open to when we get together & I'm hoping this isn't ridiculously long to read! :P

Good friend's are a rare thing.
This ad isn't for everyone, even most people.
I'm not your typical guy.

This is truly meant to stay a friendship, not putting limitations on things.
I made the choice to stay single, out of the need to examine my behavior.
One thing that was quickly realized Is the need for healthy friendships with women.

However in this I do not seek a shallow friendship.
I have a lot of value for honesty and openness. Generally being able to share what's going on in one another's lives. I am a very emotional person actually, so speaking from the heart happens a lot.

I have no time what ever for superficial conversation.

I'm more on the ""spiritual"" end of things. As a practitioner of Buddhism I meditate daily. If you happen to meditate that's awesome, if not that's cool too.
Practice is very central, so you certainly will here about it. In a respectful way, not beliefs being pushed around or anything like that.

Self love is a big one here, this is a basic of self realization.
How we view are ourselves is intimately tied to how we view others.

Being present is also a big deal. Being able to put down the cell phone, the other distractions, in general and be here, be now. If you are at a place where being distracted or entertained constantly is of value. Our interaction would be of little value. I consider alcohol and weed distractions. I am not going to judge you for what you do, please though don't do these things around me.

I like getting outdoors, a Lot!
I'm open to all kinds of adventures really, just as long as it doesn't involve, bars, movie theatres, clubs, this kinda thing.

A few practical notes, it is preferred you are single, if not please disclose. Though being single isn't mandatory, it tends to complicate things if you're not, I'd like to know.
Also I will NOT BE your texting buddy, who you never see. Please make sure you have time to have a friend. Please also make sure you are prepared to meet fairly quickly, I have no desire for a prolonged email exchange.

Let me be blunt....guys, please don't contact me. I am not divorced yet and not interested. Guess I had better put this out there as well, I'm not any way or form wanting to join you and your hubby. Thank you. 

Women, I am 48 and I want a friend who likes to go to the bars to listen to live music particularly on a Friday or Saturday night. I like to have a drink but not excessive. I love to talk about the eye candy. I am not a liberal minded person, as a matter of fact, I'm Trump all the way because of his message. I love rock to heavy metal as well as country and stuff on KBCO. I'm wide open when it comes to music although I will never attend a rap concert and I'm not into the Beyonce crap. I'm a bit hardcore with a super soft side. I have a filter but only use it when I have to. I love to laugh and have a good time. I love bikers, the kind that ride Harleys and I LOVE tattooes (the more the better). I am tattooed as well. I am attractive so you won't be embarrassed if we go out...not a troll :) I'm not a big talker but a great listener. I like to hike and workout and I eat healthy. I also believe in a relationship with God but am not religious. I'm not a bible thumper by no means. Almost all my friends are married or have kids still at home and they are homebodies so I find myself sitting at home cuz no one wants to go out. I know you're out there. Lets get together and find what life has for a few late forties women. I'm older but not dead.

Really I just want to come by or we can meet somewhere and connect for a few. I give really amazing hugs, or so I hear. I embrace people. I am an excellent listener and easy to be with. I don't want sex, just heart connection person to person and caring affectionate touch.

If you are shy I would really love to draw you out and get you talking.
Age, looks, weight don't matter. But you must live fairly close, I mean like less than 20 min away from Chambers and iliff. I'm just looking for a person who is at least a little open. I'm pretty non judgemental.

Hello all,
I have posted before seeking a friend to talk to that is in the same situation as I am in. I am a positive person and am finally past the worst part of my divorce. What is left is a person that might be insecure when they never have been before...may feel a bit lost when they have been grounded their entire life....or miss just talking about their day to someone. 
What I have found so far? Women that ask for a pic upfront as if they are only responding to my post for future dating purposes...women that so desperate to 'hook up' that they don't want to get to know someone as a friend...women that only respond with 3 word answers when you write a paragraph. 
After my divorce, the last thing I want is to go into the dating pool...sex is the last thing on my mind...and if you can't put together a friendly discussion via email, why would you even reply? I don't give a damn if you climb 14ers or teach a yoga class. I could care less about your serial dating habits...
All I seek is a true human being that is not hung up with their ex, doesn't mind talking...really talking about what is happening in their lives...and would like to slowly learn more about someone that could become a lifelong friend. Is that a too much to ask?

Cheers! :)

Are you an educated professional woman frustrated in getting things done, due to your ADHD? I am a PhD in my 50s on CU faculty whose productivity and enjoyment of life is hindered by this problem. I would like to try addressing it by working alongside someone similarly affected. 

Just working on reading, writing, programming, bill paying, etc. across the table or room from one another might be mutually beneficial. Household projects could be addressed too.

The title says it all. What can we share with one another? I have always enjoyed conversations with people regardless of topic. It is quite intriguing to listen to what people have experienced, passions in life, values they cherish and the dreams that are still being sought.

I would enjoy starting a conversation and see where it leads. I do not judge, enjoy viewpoints that differ, most importantly I enjoy talking with new people.

I have a busy professional life, but as a genlteman always should I make time to listen, learn and talk with great people.

If you are interested, please feel free to drop a note. Include in your subject line, your favorite color.

Look forward to what conversations come along!

I'm trying to meet new people to hang with around town. I'm not big into going downtown or to clubs/bars down there.

I'm also up for hitting smaller local bars for happy hour and watch a game or something. Basically anything to get me out of the house more often. 

I'll probably click best with guys near my age (34) who are either straight or otherwise masculine, since I'm not looking to date from this post - just guys to hang with more often. Also, if you live near Englewood/Littleton would be good too.

I have plenty of good friends in my life but not too many gay friends. Yeah, its great hanging out with my straight friends but it would be nice to find other guys like myself who have the same interest when it comes to the same sex. No offense but not really looking for feminine guys. I live a pretty discrete life so it just fits. The crowd I hang out with doesn't provide an opportunity to meet other gay guys like myself or that I would ever really hang out with so that's a bit of the dilemma. I am not looking for sex....particularly. Mainly looking for other laid back drama-free masculine gay guys who are fun to hang with....if other things happen then they happen but I am NOT looking to get laid here as top priority.

I am down to hang out, grab a beer, kick back, play some playstation/x-box, grab a movie, food, hike, gym, theater, art shows, travel, etc....love trying out new stuff.

I prefer someone that's open minded and honest. We don't have to share names or pics.

Trolls in the personality sense. Everyone is sensitive about something, that does not make an individual thin skinned. You know the phrase, don't throw stones at a glass house. 

Now that I got that out of the way, any comic book nerds out there would be awesome. If you have an unusual conspiracy theory, please let me know.

Hi, I'm Brad. I moved to Denver last summer from NYC, still don't know a lot of folks. I LOVE it here and am looking to meet new folks in general. I'm headed up to Winter Park next Monday morning (tickets have been purchased) and would love for someone or a few folks to join me, at least for the ride up, which is free of charge. I can drive but I don't have a rack that holds equipment but I believe average skis/boards will likely fit inside my Subaru Forester SUV. As for skiing, I'm new to the sport but can do the easiest of the greens. No worries - you don't have to baby sit me on the slopes but I'm just looking to meet some new folks and at least have some company on the ride up and back. I also like to grab a few beers while skiing so if you're into that, that's cool. 

Me: 33 y/o professional guy in a committed relationship of 8 years, so this is strictly platonic with no strings or expectations! I love Colorado and am really into the outdoors (biking, hiking/backpacking, and recently skiing - not a boarder contrary to my photo in this post). 

You: Age, gender unimportant. Just be down to earth and open to meet new folks. Oh, and it helps if you're not voting for Trump :)

Hey ladies! How would you like to earn some fairly easy cash?? I must warn you, you might think it's a bit crazy haha but hear me out. All you need to do is have fairly good ""self-control"" :)
Here's how it works: You will be asked to drink a fairly large amount of your choice of either water, tea, juice, soda, beer, etc. within a certain amount of time. Then your money making opportunity will begin! After drinking all that liquid obviously you will need to pee, but the longer you can hold your pee the more money you will earn!!!!
5 dollars for every 10 minutes that you can hold on, that's $30 an hour!!!

I told you this would be a bit crazy but really you can see it is pretty easy money! If this sounds like something crazy enough for you to try, please feel free to send me an email. We can chat for a bit about the details of this, and when/where it would take place. Again, this is a completely legit offer, and only email me if you have a serious interest in perhaps trying this out.

Hello there,

I am looking for a running buddy/friend/partner. I am currently training for a half marathon and would like to find someone to go on 4-5 mile runs with on Mondays and Fridays/Saturdays/Sundays... 

Weekday runs in the evening and weekend runs in the morning. We can chat or just run with each other and listen to music, either works for me.

Just want someone who is about the same pace, 11:30-14 minute/mile, and willing to help with accountability (give me shit if I need it).

Hope you all find what you're looking for.

Cheers,
Norm

Sometimes platonic friendship between a man and a woman comes into question. It's like there's never a situation that is 100% devoid of sexual tension on at least on parties' behalf. This, to me, is the most intriguing aspect of the male/female connection.

Sometimes, as a guy, we know the reasons why things can't go further. Women get this, as well. Even when this is the case, there is STILL some underlying tension! Why? Soooo fascinating.

So, I say let's embrace that moment. What if, say, while you were venting about your life, and you caught me with that look in my eye? That look that says ""I want you. I can't have you, but I still want you."" What if I proceeded to masturbate myself while I espoused my fantasies of how things would go if we were who were in a parallel universe? 

We can get high. We can be friends. We'll never touch or kiss or make love or play with each other's nipples... but we'll entertain the idea the way we'd entertain the idea of making it big.

Seems like Craigslist men are up to their old tricks again. Using strictly platonic to get some sort of sexual gratification in the fictitious way they try to write a ad. Its pathetic. 

I am seeking a male or female it does matter and I didn't have the choice to pick either when writing this posting so I flipped a coin. I have lived in Colorado for a very long time and I am no stranger to where the ghost towns are or old mining places. Some can be driven up too while others
require a hike. Either way its really amazing on how beautiful the places are. I will attach a few pictures to the place I went to just last weekend. It was called Gold Hill 10 miles as the crow flies
from Boulder. From it extends allot of other trails. Have you ever seen a glacier lake? They are very blue and very deep. From the edge of the lake you have about 8 inches then its straight down.
Looking from now till end of summer

Ok so I live in Florida...but I am needing a getaway for a little bit, and I may be interested in moving to the area in the near future. I would love to make a friend who I could text and talk to on the phone until I come, then can show me around, introduce me to people, and keep me company when I'm in town. If I decide to move there maybe we could be roommates. If our relationship blossoms into more than a friendship than that's ok with me. I will say that I am currently in an extremely complicated, miserable relationship. We live together and that is the only thing keeping us together. Moving will be the end of our relationship, so I'm trying to start the process of moving on from her. I am 420 friendly, I don't drink, I don't mind if you do, I just don't really like the bar scene so that's not something I would be interested in doing when I come to town.

I don't won't to meet, but would like to exchange photos, as that would enhance the experience if we are both attracted to each other. If this sounds like something you might be interested in, please reply with your eye color in the subject line.

I am something of a cuck hubby here and I am willing to bet there are others in the same situation. So, would any other men who have wives that play away be up for sharing stories and such? As humans we all find it hard to keep things bottled up and to ourselves. 

I am happy to share my experiences and pictures because I feel just being able to speak to others is very therapeutic.

soooo I know this is kind of lame and by embarking on this journey we are both acknowledging we don't make the best life decisions, but I'm lonely/super quirky and my son thinks its totally lame his awesome dad will potentially be alone on his birthday so will give this a try. I am an extremely shy and maladjusted nerd boy of the awkward 'super adorable' persuasion (other girls endorsements~ not my ego talking) seeking a quirky nerdy girl to accompany me on a birthday jaunt near belmar sometime the last week of march. I seek to underwhelm and eventually let you down as we get some grub and go see a movie. no weird stuff I promise and we can just meet somewhere down there to prove I am a man child of my word. you get bonus points for glasses sort of alternative and more than a layman's knowledge of bowie and the pixies. stuff I am into: arcade fire, pixies, bowie, lcd soundsystem, anime, comic books, dandy warhols, lego, joy division, funko pop figures, and adventure time. I am tall, sort of on the heavy side, but not completely hideous (again not my words). I promise I will be nice or at least incredibly naive in an entertaining way. either way I will treat you like a queen. thanks for reading my ad.

Dear,

Guy that's considering suicide. 

I just caught your post. I don't normally post here much and I would have emailed you but I just want to say something positive before you make a wrong choice. Plus my phone is harder to email on but if you need to talk feel free to email me.

My advice: Don't hurt yourself. It's not worth it. You have a purpose here, regardless of what assholes keep telling you.


I hope and pray that you don't hurt yourself or anyone else. I know sometimes life throws monkey wrenches at people but in order to be happy, you just need God and yourself. At least for me that's all I need but you might be different but that's ok too.

Count yourself lucky if you have somewhere to stay right now, and if you don't, I know what that's like too. Whatever rejection that comes your way just,""shake it off."" like Taylor swift wrote.

Life is rough but it gets better and I hope you know that happiness is what you make it. Just like in church today my pastor was talking about how our thoughts are a result of life. 

So if you keep thinking nobody cares you would be wrong. There's someone out there that luvs you rather it be ur mom or gf or whoever just be grateful. Jesus loves you. And he died for us all.

I'm a total stranger but I'm a rare one that cares for human life and if you ever need to chat just through email, I'm cool with it.
I make a bad ass friend. 

You can ask anyone that knows and luvs me I've been through a lot but just recently my doctor has informed me that I'm happier now, just by knowing God and not forcing my beliefs on others just living my own life. 

I will pray for you and I hope this emotional pain your feeling fades quickly. 

God bless!

Hey!

I recently moved to Colorado and I don't know too many people here. I like trying new things and exploring. I like painting & sipping wine, checking out new restaurants, going to the gym, building with legos, and going places with my little husky mix. I just like doing things. I studied biology in undergrad and now I'm prepping for medical school. 

I like being spontaneous but I also like lazy days. It'd be cool to find someone that's also down to just watch TV.

Shoot me an email with a bit about yourself. :)

Would love to chat/commiserate with a friend who shares this affliction. I was diagnosed more than two years ago, but this doesn't seem to be getting any easier. The medical side of it is taken care of; thankfully it's a minor case with very rare outbreaks. I'm an educated woman; I understand the statistics, which tell me that many people around me have this virus. Those statistics are not compelling to me. I feel like a pariah. I feel like I'll likely never be with another man and, damn it, I really loved sex.

Anyway, hoping to find a friend who has a better handle on this than I do and I think I'll find a man's perspective particularly helpful. Hoping to find a friend to help me navigate these waters!

Happy hours, dancing, dinners, lunch/brunch, events, etc would be fun. I'd love to go on light hikes too and explore some of the mountain town and festivals.

I have a professional job, monday thru friday, so weekends are free. I like pop and indie music and a little rock. Live music is great. I""m dating someone but he has kids so I'm not with him too often. I have to say, if you love Trump, we probably won't get along.

We enjoy all kinds of activities, from heading out early on Saturdays and Sundays looking for a new coffee house, tootling around to garage sales, stopping here and there at an antique store or day trips around the country side. We like to discover new hikes/walks although I don't think we are ready to concur a 14teener yet or a bike ride. We both are into refinishing all kinds of antiques and vintage pieces plus creating some repurposed items as well. We are also just as happy staying at home enjoying BBQ's, playing a game or watching a good movie (or a few episodes of the office) with a big bowl of popcorn. If you have the same interests and want to get together, drop us a note and tell us about yourselves. Please do not respond if you are looking to swing, so not us!!

I am traveling west on August 12th-Sept 6th.

I am a 40 year old woman who works full-time and goes to school full-time (Master's degree in social work). I'm not a parent but have raised kids (long story). I have a great boyfriend and a couple of good friends, but life often gets in the way of us hanging out so I'm looking to increase the friend supply, so to speak. 

I love to do ""stuff"", meaning I'm easily entertained. I love to learn and try new things but really enjoy what I call ""exploring"". I enjoy hiking, finding ghost towns (photographing them although I haven't done it in a while), road trips, going places just because I've never been and asking questions like ""hey, I wonder where this road goes?"". I am not very feminine. Doing my hair involves washing, drying, brushing it and done. My dream car is a lifted Jeep with a winch (I currently have a wimpy Jeep but it gets me down those roads I wander). I do my own remodeling work on my house, enjoy DIY projects and crafts. I don't care for shopping. Dirt and hard work don't scare me. I love horror movies and Halloween (Yay Walking Dead!). I love conversations about anything interesting...and I find almost anything interesting. I am a ""dog person"". I prefer nature and small towns over the city.

I'm not into going out for drinks because I'm not much of a drinker and don't like bars. I'm not religious or very spiritual although I love talking about those topics from a nerdy or academic standpoint. I don't smoke and am in fact very allergic to it. Don't smoke pot although I'm not against it. I'm not into drama and am looking for friends only, nothing more. I don't care if you're ""fit"" or not, I'm not ""fit"" but am not lazy either. I think it's odd when I see that caveat in CL friends posts.....""fit and attractive"".....uhhhh....so what. This is a friends post, not online dating.

I also have sarcastic humor, if you didn't pick up on that just now. 

So if you're looking for a friend to go do ""stuff"" with, and I sound like someone you could stand to go do that stuff with, send me an email.

Hi. Happy Weekend! I decided to not go skiing this weekend so find myself with some free time. I'm have a professional career (M-F) and ski, hike or run on the weekends. I'm divorced and not looking for a relationship. I'm enjoying my freedom. Most of my friends are married with families so I find myself wanting to go see a movie, but would prefer to meet a new friend for some drinks beforehand. Maybe we could go to Alamo Taphouse/Movies off Santa Fe? Here are some movies I would like to see, but am open to suggestions. I'm looking for a woman close to my age, give or take a few years, who doesn't smoke, ideally is active and has a professional career (would like to hang out and have a nice discussion) so these attributes would most likely make it less uncomfortable. I'll be running some errands today, but checking emails and responding so please feel free to ask questions.

So, to the point... I am a single white male aged 30 years. I am looking for at the very least a good chat, preferably more... Like forever maybe... 

Intimacy, both physical and emotional, are big with me.

So... Things of note:

I am a sucker for a good back rub.

I am willing to give back/foot rubs as well

I have some kink, but if we bond well your kink is also my kink... Within reason :P

Dildos/Vibes do not intimidate me in the slightest. I think they're kinda fun :P

I like getting head, but love eating pussy more...

Bi girls to the front of the line... and it isn't even about wanting/hoping for a threeway... I just think female sexuality is awesome and envy it I guess...

I am a smoker/Vaper... Not big into 420, but not against it either.

Soo...... Are you:

21-35?

Interested?

I'm bound to get spammed, so please prove that you are a real person. I will not email you beyond the CL annon email right away, nor will I text you until I know you are real.

Its Friday and I'd like to make a new friend. 
I smoke weed in the evenings and just got a Nintendo 64 and some games... thought it would be fun to have a girl come smoke and play with me. 

I have a dab rig, shatter, planning to buy flower after work. I can host (but I do have roommates) or I can travel and bring it all with. 

Physically:
24 
5'2 n slim
Hazel eyes 
Bald 
Caramel skin 
A few tattoos and piercings 

Sexuality:
I am not looking for anything more than a friendship. I am pansexual, find all humans beautiful.

Gender identity: 
He/Him pronouns please.
I identify as non binary/Androgynous, meaning I don't feel I fit into M or F Gender, many consider me ""both"" as my brain is M and my body is F. 

Personality: 
I'm a natural shy Virgo 
Soft spoken and kind hearted. I always have weed and chocolate on hand. 
However, My inner thoughts are intense as shit, and I curse a lot.
I only open up when I'm High, so if you enjoy deep philosophical conversations when you're stoned then we will get along well! 


What I'm looking for: 
An open minded friend 
Maybe you're nonbinary too
Ita okay if not, but an acceptance and understanding of the lgbt lifestyle is required. Smoke weed, obviously. Choloate and/or Pho lover is a plus as I eat both often. 
No video game experience required, I haven't played 64 in twelve years so I'm not real competition. 

So... if an evening like this sounds enticing, please email me :) I live in Aurora near children's hospital, but I can travel to you. Please be over 21. If you have a LINE account, My tag is OnixJ, otherwise email. I'd love to hang out tonight, or make plans for another evening.

the only thing i ask is no pervy dudes... i don't mind hanging out with guys but i feel the need to throw that out there. i have a pretty top notch boyfriend, but he couldn't come with me :( but other than that, i'm laid back, love music, nature, going out for drinks, and being adventurous. i want to make super rad friends while i'm there so feel free to email me!

Looking for a friend. Someone to chat with, hang out sometimes and have fun with. Not looking for sex. Be honest, no woman has got me excited that way, in a very long time. 
I enjoy FX creations, cosplay and lifecasting. Actually trying to start my own business doing that. I enjoy video games and Star Wars. Also, a huge Minion fan.
I am open to talking/meeting anyone. Age and race is not a concern. I just like positive people and not negative.

Good morning,

I am a married man. Just want to start there, not looking to change my situation. But I had another long ""conversation"" with my spouse last night about how we are not on the same page in several areas in our lives. We are not unhappy but we both know or I guess I should say mostly I know that these ""areas"" are never going to change and just have to accept them as they are. But I still long for intelligent conversation about life and its challenges. I am looking for a woman who is willing to talk about life, listen to my thoughts and intelligently respond with thoughtful insight and maybe even suggestions on a new and fresh approach. I refuse to have conversations where one participant is acting like a teenager instead of an adult and it gets frustrating. I know it sounds like the reverse of the drama couples usually see but that is my relationship. Always has been. If you are an intelligent woman who listens well and is interested, please let me know and we can chat. I think you will find the situation intriguing and even if we get nowhere the conversation can still be stimulating and rational. I have a kik account I can provide after we have some preliminary discussion and trust can be established. Looking forward to talking to someone mature enough to think beore they respond.

So I'm a 26 year old guy out in California, I'm unhappy here and not really able to find work, even through temp agencies.
Shit sucks for me and it just gets me depressed.
I honestly have no money, all I have is the clothes on my back, my car and a dozen boxes of my personal belongings in a spare bedroom at my grandfathers who's letting me stay here because it's better than living out on the streets or in my car.

I tried to move away in 2014. I went to Seattle, I loved it! Being somewhere new and different just filled me with different feelings and I liked that. I felt like anywhere but California is where I belong. Unfortunately I had to go back because I couldn't get a job quick enough. Oh well.

I took a quick look and saw that studios are as low as $600 a month and thought ""yo that's perfect. I do not care about a one bedroom, I eat and sleep in the same room here at my grandfathers already. I'm used to small living quarters."" And I've got some experience with maintenance and some porter work and noticed jobs for apartments needing people.
I have some tools of my own, I can turn over an apartment with some help, I'm not good enough to do it alone yet but I'm not afraid to do work. I still have a lot to learn though. 

I just...I'm hating my life and myself here every passing day and I want to get away from this feeling. I just wish I could pack up and move out there to Denver but I won't get far with what little I have now and I don't have a computer, only this iPhone with a cracked screen. 
I thought I'd maybe post here and see if I could make a friend or just find someone to talk to.
