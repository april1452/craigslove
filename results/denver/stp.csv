Older Southern gentleman, lifelong bachelor; I have had many beautiful girl friends over the years who all would say I have NEVER cheated on a girlfriend in my life. Moral compass. 

A little bit of a nutrition and fitness nut. I am 6'2"", the same weight 180 lbs., and body I was when I tried out for the corner at an elite college football program at age 19 (pic after football camp attached). I can out last most guys in their 30's. Girl trainers, fitness models, and nutrition nuts follow me on Pinterest and Twitter. Women my age BORE me; I would rather be alone than be with someone I have no interest in.

I have been ""Discrete Friend"" to girls 19 to 28 or at least have 4 in the past 10 years who have also become BEST FRIENDS. My latest, from when she was 19 to 22, graduated last June and teaching abroad while working on her Masters in Spanish. Our planned graduation left me with an empty heart.

I met her when she saw me giving an investment presentation. She began calling and asking questions, odd for a 19-year-old, but I was nice and patient as she called just to chat. 

I became her virtual lover. . . during the day she would text, call, email. . . like lovers do and every night for over 2 years I told her a bedtime story. 

Simply seek to be close with a girl who has not yet lost her sense of wonder and wants a man to talk to who only seeks her happiness. Tell her a bedtime story every night to assure her Sweet Dreams.

Honestly, you location doesn't really matter, it is what is inside that counts. But, I am quirky, and I am okay with that and hope you are too. I like things in common and age within 5 years. Nothing wrong with wanting someone to correspond with that has your same interests. Here are the things I would like to talk about with a penpal:

1. You are single, I am as well. I don't want to disrespect anyone involved. Around my age range, within 5 years.
2. Love of the outdoors, nothing better than being with Mother Nature and loving a ski trip, a run, a bike, a hike, a kayak, a boat, anything outside.
3. A good drink, a night by the fire with a good wine or a great beer is good.
4. A superhero outfit, you never know when you will need one.
5. A good education and a good job. This is one of the things I value in my life that is up on the top. Prob #3.
6. Enjoying the moment.
7. Random yard ornaments. Gazing balls, solar lights, bird baths, shiny things are so darn cool.
8. Random thoughts and acts of kindness, 4 out of 5 voices in my head told me to post this. 
9. A getaway car. 
10. I am not looking for a meetup. That's why I posted in strictly platonic. No pics are necessary, just a like mind.
11. Eleven is from heaven, tell me about yourself. I won't respond to a ""Hello"" especially after I spent the time to create this post.

Let me know your superhero outfit!

Hi there, =) 
I am a 23 yr old lesbian looking for friends in the area. I've been in the area for three years now. Right now I'm in the process of self improving and have decided that not being in a relationship is detrimental to the process. I just left a 2 yr relationship and was very distraught doing so but it was do to my personal failings. Thankfully we are still friends and have a ton of love for each other. Right now she is my only friend in Colorado. I think it would be healthy for me to branch out and know more people during this transition in life.

I've always had great expectations for myself and won't be happy until I feel fulfilled. I want that lust for life and hopefully I meet like minded people. 
I've lived a dangerous and unpredictable life but that's behind me (thankfully). I'm striving to be the best self I can. 
Now with that being said, I work a lot and wouldn't be around all of the time but I keep an open ear for friends and am not that far away. I'm pretty political for the most part. Stong opinions but not pushy. I'm into everything outdoors. Can't say I'm very good for shopping. Movies are OK but not usually entertaining, more of a documentary kind of girl. I'm seriously level headed so if you need a grounder, I'm your gal. Don't think I'm super bland, I've got whit to boot ;) can be a complete riot.

t has been said that the whole is more than the sum of it's parts. Synergism is what I desire in a personal relationship with a woman. I wish to be more than a stunted part of a stale entity. I see each of us as a cracking element of a synergistic event. Somewhere there is such a woman worthy of both my trust and admiration. I have dedicated my life to be such a man, capable of lending my strength and honoring that which is best between us. A man is made of many thing's, none of which can be seen at a glance.

I am incarcerated, there will be obstacles and challenges to negotiate. ""Never judge a book by it's cover,"", I'm sure you've heard that before, and what would life be like for us if we were all to scared to explore?

I am spirited, there will be adventure and excitement to endure. And I am passionate, there is hope and a high regard for matters of the heart. But tomorrow I see change, a chance to build anew. Built on spirit, intent of heart and ideals based on truth. It's only a moment of your time, email me and you will be sent ways to contact me directly.

So it seems in my experience that women only talk about wanting a decent guy. The reality is they end up with the opposite. I'm hoping that I'm wrong and I guess I will find out. I would really like to meet a woman that appreciates nice guys whether it's as friends or more. I'm 35 brown hair and eyes and 200lbs. I have a pic i will send. I play a lot of hockey so that keeps me in shape. Write me back and lets grab a drink and just have a fun night out. The worst that can happen is we each make a new friend.

please put hockey in the subject line so I know you're real

I cannot wait to move to Denver next weekend! I am a 23 year old girl coming from Upstate NY who is passionate about a career in event planning, travel & hospitality. I'm very big into fitness and love to stay healthy. I have heard so much about the Denver lifestyle and how amazing it is and I am very excited to become a part of it soon. 

Since I do not know anyone in Denver(besides my cousin), I really am looking for a fun, local, active guy to take me around the city and help me explore my new home. Please be between the age range of 23-35. I also prefer you to be single, but if you're attached, that's OK too. Mainly, just be outgoing!

Anyways, I would like to email/text/snap for the next week so that when I do get to Denver next weekend and we want to meet up, we will have already become familiar with one another. 

Hope to hear from you soon!

Mostly someone I can go to the gym with and on hikes maybe camping trips later once it warms up. My new job has left me in a shape that I'm not totally happy with.

So very little sunlight and not much movement.

Now that you have read my life story... I would like to find someone who I can go to the gym with fairly regularly and go on hikes and in the summer if we still hang out make trips up to Leviathan rock and hanging lake and places like that.

I'm not picky on looks or age and probably won't turn anyone down unless they are a prick. that being said the more attractive you are the more motivation I have to work back to my godly awesomely.

Looking for a clubbing friend, mostly Milk, but I am open to other places notably Lipgloss. Also wouldnt mind learning swing dance or really any kind of dance. A kind Cl responder suggested it. I have done Salsa all of once, had alot of fun at La Rumba but was hilariously bad at it!

I am married, so yes this is platonic. Unlike most of the females posting ads, platonic doesnt mean give me free stuff or romantic relationship at my convenience.

I just want to dance with a friend and sadly hollywoods lied to me saying all women love dancing and all straight men hate it.

Tired of going alone, and tired of drink ho's asking for drinks, its been a while but one can never be UN-tired of drink hos.

I do possess a mohawk, and I workout so Im fit. Still trying to lose those last 10lbs, but there isnt a workout for my overly inflated ego. Yeah, totally take myself seriously. :-).

Im also available for coffee houses! I like chai

Since its come to my attention that theres crazies and Im supposed to be terrified of the internet Ive taken my pics down. Also, since the female platonic ads are rife with Pic or no reply....guess I get to join ya and demand a pic before I reply. Supposedly its to know who Im talking to, but I really dont want a pic of you I just want something funny.

Hello, new CL bestie!! I'm new to the 30's (just turned last month) and am looking for a kick-ass girl to get to know. I'm huge into music and would be awesome to find someone to attend some local shows with. Not your typical Coloradan, as in I don't get down with the 420 and I would mind if you do! Just not anything I care to partake in, and would appreciate the same. As far as drinking goes, have at it! Haha 

I love watching Netflix and chillin on the weekends, even a lot during the week. Going out ALL. THE. TIME. is just overrated and SO expensive. I like home-cooked dinner and watching tv, or just having great conversation and then grabbing some dessert and walking afterwards. I work a M-F job that I love and that allows me to have tons of fun (just bought a new car!!). 

Would be great to find a cute girl to go hang out and just have fun with. I'm all for if you're a healthy eater, as I would love to get in a little better shape (I mean, me being 'fat' is 6', 200 and running 3-4 miles a day! Haha) I'm an advocate of working out, but really don't care if you do. Would love someone that can go grab Mickie D's with me for dinner on a random Wednesday night! All in all, just looking for a fun girl that would enjoy the company of a fun guy! :) Someone that can and will talk about anything, from sex to movies to the idiocy of politics and religion (and if you're a fan of those, I'm very respectful and will value your opinions! :), and everything in between!!

Ask away with any questions you have, and please be a good conversationalist; nothing kills a friendship boner quicker than poor communication skills. Haha And I would like if you sent a photo, as I will do so in return. I hope you enjoyed my random novel, and have a great day! :D

I'm posting this ad in the hopes of finding some new couples to spend time with, who aren't flaky and have the ability to commit to making plans ahead of time without always canceling at the last minute! I'm sure if you're taking the time to read this ad, you probably have friends like this - the kind who always complain about how they're bored and want to do stuff, but as soon as you propose doing something they're ""busy"" or ""can't go."" As you get older you realize you don't have the time or energy to constantly be the only side of the relationship putting in effort when it comes to spending time together. Therefore, if you are also a couple that wants to make new friends that are actually up for DOING things, let's talk! My husband and I live outside of Colorado Springs, but coming from the East Coast where it takes an hour to drive 15 miles on most days, driving doesn't bother either of us. Plus I figure that everyone here drives into the mountains throughout the year, so what's the difference in a one hour drive between the Springs and Denver suburbs if you have friends you want to spend time with?

One of the biggest reasons we moved to Colorado was to be able to enjoy the outdoors, so we want to meet other people who like to be outside and want to go hiking or visit new places on a semi-regular basis. We try to go hiking every weekend (though it's more low key now that it's colder), and I have a whole list of places I want to go in/around Colorado Springs and the rest of the state. Last summer we did a lot of hiking up off 70, climbed Quandary Peak and made our way out towards Aspen. We want to get down to the Sand Dunes and spend some time in Crested Butte this summer to see the wildflowers.

We have an awesome dog so if you like animals that's a plus. We adopted her over the summer and she loves trails, so she usually comes with us when we go hiking - unless of course it's somewhere dogs aren't allowed, we don't just bring her to be tools. Finding a couple with a dog that also wants to get out and explore would be great, but you don't have to have a dog as long as you don't hate them or something. 

My husband loves football, video/computer games (what dude doesn't?) and is in the process of getting his Masters degree. We both have hard science degrees, love to travel and do not smoke (anything). We don't have kids, and are looking for people in the same boat. 

If anything about this sounds familiar to you, feel free to shoot me an email so we can chat some more! I really hope there are some people out there who are in the same boat - there is too much cool stuff to do around here to sit inside and not get out and see it!

I enjoy people watching. Just watching the behaviors of people and trying to think through different scenarios of their circumstances. Like looking at the way someone is walking and trying to determine if they are single walking home to a movie, walking home to a wife or girlfriend? Its amazing the shit you can come up with and learn from observing people. Is there anyone out there who is also weird that way? Maybe we can meet and people watch . . .

Are you stuck?

What if working out and proper nutrition was more than just a Means to
lose weight and get into shape?

What if it was a catalyst to shifting your life?

In my years as a trainer I have noticed one amazing thing about
purposeful movement and good nutrition. It gives people to confidence
to do amazing things with their lives!

People step up into better engagement in their jobs, relationships, in their lives!
Of course a healthier body shows up along for the ride, but are you ready to really shift your life?

How about a complementary exploratory session to see what is possible?

Does anybody read these ? Do they legitimately work ? Here goes nothing. 

Mid-thirties man looking for friends. Someone to exercise with, hike with, grab a beer and talk about our week, other casual stuff not presently at the forefront of my mind. 

I'm in a happy relationship, just don't have many friends. Prefer women over men because they actually listen when you talk and don't tend to let their egos get in the way of an honest conversation. 

I can prove I'm real if you can. I will actually want to hang out or do activities, I'm not looking for an email buddy. Let's grab a beer and shoot the shit

Addendum. Strictly platonic people ! Google it if you don't know what that means. I get plenty of attention and affection and I don't need a cuddle buddy. I'm lolling for friends to chill with, grab a beer, whatever is in the realm of platonic, nothing more. Jesus Christ!

Hi there. My name is Rob. I used to live in Denver several years ago and now I'm returning for a visit from 3/8 to 3/13. I live in Ohio currently and just can't seem to find a woman here who I like. I would like to meet a white woman in Denver for some fun and travel in CO. I am extremely attracted to both red heads and women with dark features. But if you don't fit into that category, please don't worry about it. I am pretty flexible with age. I would say anywhere from 25 - 43 is fine. I am really NOT into women with kids though. However, if I met the right woman, I'd like to have kids with her one day. 

I would really like someone to connect with more than anything else. I'm a good guy with a little bit of a wild streak, fun, articulate, and will talk about anything under the sun with you. I like to hike, fish, go white water rafting, go to the breweries, and have a very strong interest in holistic and metaphysical things. But at the same time I am also very grounded. I just got a new job in the IT field that I am starting right after I return home. In the meantime, this is my time for fun and adventure! And I would love to hang out with someone fun, who is kind, warm, caring, affectionate, grounded and who I can relate to and talk with easily. Please respond and I will provide more information so we can talk more.

Do you have a desire to feel more at ease with life, no matter what is going on?

Having your Bars run can do just that. There are 32 points on your head that correspond to things like; healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named.

They store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything.

For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called ""money.""

Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it, clearing the space for new awareness to come in.

The creative possibilities for your life begin to open up!

It's been said that at worst a Bars session will feel like a great massage. At best, it will change your life!

That title is right to the point. I'm a Denver native, but it's time for some new faces. I figured I'd give this a try, maybe there are some other cool people looking for the same thing. I'm really looking for people who like going out drinking, to rock shows, and smoking/dabbing until they pass out. Not about the conservative gun loving types. I'm 23, white, liberal if you can't tell, and open to most people who fit the description above. Gender not important either just looking for friends. Hit me up and let's start hanging out.

Hello! 

I am looking to find some people more my speed. I don't have too many friends because I have and older soul and it is hard to befriend girls my age. We just have different goals I think. I am looking for someone to make crafts with, read books, get coffee, shop, and maybe take walks/hikes or exercise classes. 

A little about me ; 31 yrs old, never married but i have a bf. I have a 12 yr old son (full custody) I don't smoke or do drugs. I do drink occasionally. Getting together to craft and drink a bottle of wine sounds Amazing to me!!!! I have a dog. I like to read, watch movies, hang out with my son. Right now I am deeply into learning different things to sew. I'm new so learning to not break my machine! Other crafts im learning is making stained glass, glass etching, mosaics, candles, painting wooden projects. Those are just what I have in my closet right now. Mainly just sewing at the moment. I would love to find someone similar in interest. I dont care your age race or occupation. I am looking for a genuine friend to spend time with, learn from and help learn.

I have a research project involving Cannabis and meditation. I'm currently in need of a vivid dreaming female who can follow instructions and is not afraid of the unknown. I'll provide all the instructions and help acquire the materials needed. This is no scam but 100% science. 

You'll medicate at home and follow my instructions. You can start seeing results in the first week. You'll experience enhanced clarity, greater relaxation, and profound spiritual well-being to just name a few. We're going to be ""turning the lights on"" in your brain, so, there will also be increased good dream activity and fewer nightmares.

Take this journey and you'll be able to get in on the ground floor of something big. I'm putting this program in to a book after my first success and I strongly believe we'll be able to help a lot of people.

Hi. I'm looking for a down to earth friend to hang out with, have fun, and help get my mind back where it needs to be. I'm not looking for a hook up! I just want to put myself out there and see where the universe takes me. If it matters I'm an attractive guy. I have an awesome personality, great sense of humor, somewhat sarcastic at times, loves life and wants to enjoy what the future brings. 

I'm a very honest person and am looking for the same. I'm very open minded on things. I like to go out, enjoy the weather, love movies, playing golf, tennis, pool among many other things. I've became somewhat of a foodie and like to try and enjoy fine dining. I'm 420 friendly, rarely drink.

I'm really not sure what to say. But I'm an open book and welcome any questions. Pic for pic.

First off..a message to the guys who will send me an email. I'm not interested!!! I don't have problems finding men in real life. And since you'll ask anyway I'll save you the time. I'm 34f . 


So hoping to find a PIC or BFF. So I'm new to the area and def need some girl time. I am looking for a friend or friends that love to go out and enjoy life. Preferably love to go dancing, shopping, clubbing, bar hopping. Basically living it up as young 20's year olds. 

I prefer that you're single because from past experience it just isn't the same when going out with a girl in a relationship. I need somebody that will watch my back as I watch hers. 

Somebody that is non judgemental. Somebody that if I leave with a guy at the bar/club will be calling me up the next day to see how great it was and not judging me by giving me a hard time. 

I love to dress to impress. I wear a lot of halter tops that tend to show cleavage. I also wear leggings a lot that make the booty stick out lol. So if you don't want to be around that we probably won't get along. Would be awesome if you're on the same page so I'm not alone lol

I listen to mostly hip hop and rap r n b. Prefer stuff with a good beat and can dance too.

I smoke and drink. I do like 420 but not a big deal if you're not into it BUT I do smoke cigs. 

Please when responding lemme know your favorite stores to shop in, music taste, types of guys you're into. And anything else you're into.

I don't know exactly what I'm looking for. Maybe just a fresh new connection outside of my little circle. The truth is I don't get out much anymore to meet anyone. I work a full time career with a very demanding schedule. I have two kids and I make enough to thankfully support my wife being a stay at home mother. I'm 29 years old and bored sick. I'm so tired of the monotonous same old same old. I'm not looking for love, my wife fulfills me in that aspect. Hence the strictly platonic posting. I'm looking for someone like me. Maybe a new best friend. Someone that intrigues me. I'm not easily impressed but maybe you can impress me? As for me, I'm one of those ""intellectual"" types. Not really geeky although I could nerd out on a few things. I speak very open and honestly which some people find a little blunt. Yes I can be blunt. Brutal. But very honest. Im working graveyards so night owls are more than welcome. Everyone has problems in one way or another however I ask that you not be addicted to any sort of drugs. Thanks.

Hello, 

My bf and I moved to Colorado a couple years ago and we would like to find some friends that we both have things in common with. We haven't seemed to meet many good friends in the area, so we decided to start looking. 

So far we love Denver and all of Colorado that we have been to so far! Some of the things we like are: Hanging out, watching movies, dancing, fishing, camping, motorcycles, road trips, playing pool, games, he is trying to learn a bit about photography, I am a very girly girl, I like getting my nails done, shopping and getting dressed up to go out.

He is an Air Force veteran who now works an odd work schedule out of state, and I am in the admin field We are both professionals, ddf (drug, drama free), and an every day average family! We are proffesionals, homeowners, but fun!

Well if you are interested in getting to know us, send us a message :-) also looking for girlfriends as well so w4w or w4mw would apply.

So, I really need some perspective right now. My dating life has been strange lately. I don't do online dating, won't date girls from work and pretty much only hang out in my neighborhood. I also try not to mess around with girls in my neighborhood. I do meet girls, usually randoms that are I meet somewhere out in my neighborhood. That is usually either a straight hookup or very short term. 
Well, I met this girl last week at my regular bar recently. I had never seen her in there and she is one of those girls you would notice but she claims she goes in there and does live around there. We hit off but it was just great conversation. She showed up a few days later and actually told me she wanted to run into me and was surprised I didn't ask for her number last time. Again, it was a great time. She has a complicated life. She works and has a young child. So, from what she told me, she is very hesitant when it comes to guys. We made a plan for a proper date and have been texting daily ever since. 
So, this morning I responded to the last text she sent last night. I fell asleep early and it seemed like she was seeing if I was out or at home. I didn't get a response so just asked if she was having a busy day. She text back saying yes and it hasn't been a great day. I was consoling and said I wish I could meet her but I'm not off for a couple of hours. She said she had something to tell me. That's never good. She said she went out last night, to that neighborhood bar and ended up hooking up with someone. She feels horrible about it because that's not her and she really likes me. She just had a rough day at work and things went further than she wanted with drinking and that guy. She also said she understands if I don't want to talk to her anymore because I probably know the guy. 
So, I don't know what to think. I have my history. I was with someone for a random hookup the week before I met her but I think that situation is different. Considering we kissed, I'm imagining ""hooking up"" meant they had sex. She's been very clear about me having to be patient with her and I was willing. From our talks, I think she is finally over things with her ex and wanting to date someone. I liked the way she has been with me, really like her and we connect well. It's bad enough that her actions contradict what she has told me but even worse that I probably know the guy. I'm glad she was honest though. I guess that counts for something. 
So, please share some advice or thoughts with me. It's difficult because of how I mentioned my dating life is and I do honestly feel we had a great connection. Is there a way to get over this?

I figured I'd give this a try since I've had surprisingly amazing luck on Craigslist before so here goes nothing:

I'm a 25 yo female looking for female friends on Craigslist. I know it's kind of a weird concept, but I've been in CO for 3 years for graduate school and now that that's done, most of my friends have moved away and I find myself in serious need of a female friend.

About me: I'm 25, in a serious relationship, have a cat and work a full time 8-5 M-F job. I'm open minded, friendly, trustworthy, a good listener, 420 friendly and I drink occasionally (nothing sloppy though lol). I like reading, traveling, watching TV and movies, going out to new bars and restaurants, and music (going to live shows, listening to music on my iPhone, etc). I'm also starting to get into more outdoorsy things like fishing, camping, hiking, etc too.

What I'm looking for in a friend: Someone with similar personality traits who would like to do similar things. I would love someone to go out with on the weekends, or just chill low-key. Someone who's into doing some girly stuff would also be a plus. I like getting my nails and hair done every once in awhile and some company would be nice since my b/f has no interest in doing those things with me (surprise, surprise haha). Some who is an animal lover (or at least tolerant of animals) would also be a plus since I have a super friendly cat that'll want nothing more than to love the hell outta you. 

So if you've read this and think we'd be a fit as friends email me and attach a picture and we'll see what happens!

Thanks!

Do you need to be spanked or just like the idea? 

Would being held accountable motivate you to work harder on your personal goals, classes, traffic violations, over spending, attitude, general behavior, or some other problem? 

Nothing tells a woman to straighten up like a spanking.

For fun or discipline. Try it once, meet occasionally, or regularly like once a week.

Obviously with the exposure given by media and gotten by celebrity, the idea of exposing one's leg or breast is still something participated in throughout society.

However, what about the every-day-person who is also ready, willing and able to participate in such activities? The possibilities are significantly less apparent! For those who enjoy a bit of the ""risqué"", there is the fine art of ""flashing"". It happens every Friday on Craigslist, right? Well, I would like to introduce a new and exciting sport for those who would like to memorialize your Simi-public flashing bent. I will agree to take or follow you around town and take pictures of you in any locations and in any state of dress, or partial dress or undress flashing you would like to have pictures of. This can be fun in your heart and mind is into such recreation. Let me know your thoughts, ok?

Hello,

I'm a 32 year guy who has had a weird last few years, taking me out of my element, and putting me in a position of being more introverted than my normal self (I can explain all of this in detail in person). As I come out of this period in my life, I'm finding my social skills to be a little rusty, and I want to find someone to talk to, especially about dating. I haven't had any problems with dating, per se, but I feel I'm not seeing the results I'd like to lately, and would love to get some outside perspective.

A little about me: I own a small business, very physically active, love gardening & cooking, and overall a caring, open, and passionate person. Additionally, I live in Boulder. The reason I'm posting in the Denver group is because it's more active than the Boulder group, and feel I'll find more diverse perspectives here. Meeting in Denver would be easiest for me, though I meet in other areas that are conveniently accessed with public transportation, or via bicycle. 

On a final note: I've been told I'm a very good listener, and this wouldn't be a one-way street. If you need to talk about anything in your life, I'd love to listen and help.

To all the CL Ladies (preferably attractive lol),
Settling in town, don't have that big a circle of friends and thought this wouldn't hurt. I have been told to be quite attractive, fun, and intelligent (know the difference between their, there and they're lol).
The type where my group of friends would be shocked I even came to CL, so shhh, let's be discreet lol.

In my 20's, tall, come from a diverse background, Handsome and in great shape, high sex drive and just really enjoy the company of an attractive female. 

No specific type on my end, just be in shape, fun to talk to and good company. Fair enough?
I know there's gotta be normal people on here who are looking for the same lol, I'm sure I'm not the only one.

Also, I realized I'm not exactly sure what I'm wanting so keeping an open mind. I hope you would too... If we just end up being good friends, I'm happy with that. FWB? Sure. maybe something more or something less....

Add your age in the subject so I know you're real. Pics get faster responses!

This is the ad you've been waiting for: I'm looking for a FWB, but not just for random hook-ups. I want to be able to talk to you, flirt, have fun and laugh...get excited about each other's texts, wait with butterflies for each other's emails, wondering if maybe we went too far suggesting something kinky or admitting something really personal about ourselves. And then move to meeting when the time feels right. Do you want that kind of relationship back again? I do. So let's give it a try.

I am married, and it's fine if you are too. Basically, we're roommates, and I know for certain she's had some outside relationships. I can't really change things right now, so my thought is why not make someone happy, and find fulfillment and excitement outside, as long as nobody gets hurt? In the long run, it's better for everyone. So let's just have fun! There will be some sneaking around to communicate, but that's also part of the fun, right?

Me: I'm 41, 5'8, in good shape. I'm outdoorsy, educated, and have a good, if a little dry and random, sense of humor. Plenty of interests and ideas for conversation topics. You: surprise me! Just be someone I can connect with.

If we click, I'm in for the duration! No one word emails/chats or long silences from me. Just fun, excitement, and some badly needed release of frustration for both of us.

Having been involved in athletics and personal training for 30+ years,
I've achieved a lot of my personal targets around athletics and my body.
I've been stuck on the couch and shifted back into movement all the while thinking I don't have the time to exercise or eat right.

I've learned what really created the shifts for me to be able to achieve these targets I had for myself. It isn't the work or effort I put into it, it wasn't forcing discipline or faking that having patience was fine. It was a shift in how I was choosing to think. How I think about the target itself and how I think about the journey vs the end goal.

I can show you this, build a plan for you around your exercise, nutrition and the mindfulness habits to support and get you to your targets!

Would you be interested in a complimentary 30 minute discovery session to see what is possible for you, and if we can build this plan together to achieve your targets?

There is no obligation to hire me, and you will walk away with at least one tool you can employ right now to help you!

Do you have a desire to feel more at ease with life, no matter what is going on?

Having your Bars run can do just that. There are 32 points on your head that correspond to things like; healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named.

They store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything.

For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called ""money.""

Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it, clearing the space for new awareness to come in.

The creative possibilities for your life begin to open up!

It's been said that at worst a Bars session will feel like a great massage. At best, it will change your life!

Are you interested in seeing what a 60 or 90 minute Bars session can do for you?

I just want to be honest from the beginning ,I'm looking for friends to help me explore Colorado. I moved here two months ago from California , I do have a wife in California. She's not sure she wants to move out here. I don't have any kids. I'm not looking for any drama, stress, or issues. Just want to go out to restaurants movies outdoors I want to get to know the good local spots to just enjoy and relax . Also would like to find some workout buddies. I go to the lakeshores gym. I do work a lot but my evenings are free. I haven't done this before so I'm kind of skeptical. Respond with comments a pic, just be real. I just don't have time for games or dishonesty. I'm not looking to meet right away.

Ladies are you seeking a sensual experience? Do you enjoy the feeling of strong, experienced, oiled hands, massaging your body? I offer erotic massages. I am seeking a lady or ladies that might enjoy a massage on occasion, (possibly a regular thing). I am available days, some evenings, and weekends. Looking to give a massage that will be memorable for you. I travel quite a bit, so I understand those stuck in hotels needing distraction. I can travel, I am a tall, with dark hair and hazel eyes, I carry an extra 10-15lbs, but at 6' tall it is not bad, I am easy going and not pushy. Ask any questions you may have, I have a picture if you want to exchange. I am clean and DD free, I prefer mature ladies of all legal ages.

Recently moved to a different part of town than I was in, and I have no friends out here at all. Looking to change that. I don't really care what your age is, or what your sex is, or your race, but I should let you know a little bit about myself so you know what type of person I am

I'm a musician, gamer, and stoner, and those go in interchangeable order. I also smoke cigarettes and cigars, so if that is not cool with you, tough luck. I've been playing guitar for 5 years and would love someone to jam with, or at least appreciate music with. I'm also mostly a pc gamer, but love playing Project M and am down to play other games (I don't have many myself, but if you do that's cool) Movies are great, walks in the park, just goofing off in general. I might seem opinionated or pretty radical, so if you are a conservative/ultra Christian we might not hit it off, unless we can keep that stuff under the table. I'm also pretty sarcastic and deadpan, so be prepared for me to say off color things that I don't mean at all. 

I guess I'd just like someone to hang out with, and if you're the right girl, maybe it can go further. Who knows. 

As a last note, it would be better to hang out with people closer to my age, as it would be easier to identify and relate to, but I'm not prejudiced. 

Also if it matters to you, I'm a white male, brunet hair, grey eyes.

I made a friend through Craigslist, and it was nerve wracking, perhaps embarrassing to think I'd needed to use the internet to find anyone to talk to. I've got a good personality, am fun, not a nut or a druggie and I even have all my teeth. But there I was, and he and I had made a connection, became friends and had big hopes for the future. 

But in time, he fell ill and passed away and I miss him terribly. I miss the random texts and his sense of humor. A lot has happened since then, and I find myself in a new town where everyone seems so very busy.

I'm not really expecting any replies and I don't expect to find what I had before (that wouldn't be fair to future friends), but I would like to move on. I'd love to have someone to text. 

That being said if you like heavy metal, odd things that are a little dark or macabre, art, film, the unusual, I'm for you. I'm open-minded, strange, and an artist. I love long conversations, but also cozy shared silence, falling asleep to a horror movie, going for walks in the rain in the summer, laying in the grass in a park in the middle of the night, laughs over pizza and playstation, people watching while sharing tea. I need a muse and a gentleman, but perhaps also an oddball, not someone who NEEDS me, but WANTS me. There's a difference. 

Anyway, friends or lovers, it doesn't matter. I'm happy with platonic, and believe that's where it should begin. **I'm not judgemental (I can handle most circumstance, I understand that shit happens), but please don't contact me if you're married. Be divorced, or working on a divorce for crap's sake. I'm no one's side woman. Pics will happen if we connect, and no, I don't want to see your dick.

So tonight I'm bored. Lonely is a better way to put it. Miss the feeling of making a new connection. To be excited to hear someones life story help them with advice and just learn about someone. I wish I had a movie date or maybe grab a beer. I don't do 420 like I use to but for the right girl maybe I'd dabble.

So I just moved to Denver a few weeks ago, and I don't know anyone for a 600-mile radius. As if making friends at 21 isn't hard enough, I can't go back to school for a year until I have in-state tuition, blah blah blah. 
SO. That's where you come in. I'm a totally normal person, I'm just a little out of my comfort zone and my husband's best advice was to tell people I like potatoes... I like to do anything outside, play with my dogs, go dancing (bonus if you like country bars!), work out, read, binge-watch Netflix, and anything that fosters an adrenaline rush. I don't do drugs, I rarely drink, and I'm married so I'm not interested in anything other than friendship, (but I promise I'm not totally vanilla, I have piercings and tattoos!)
I'm fluent in sarcasm and I'm a giant goofball. Also, I can lick my elbow. 
If you maybe wanna try to be my friend, reply and we can totally come up with another story other than meeting on CL.

It takes all kinds of people to make the world go 'round. 
And we are a couple that chose to embrace those that 
are a little different, who's ideas of a good time venture 
outside the normal parameters set by society, and we are
seeking out those that are like us in this aspect.

Male, female, couples, it doesn't matter! Good people
are good people no matter what, and that's what we are 
looking for. Good, honest, down to earth people who 
still have morals and place value on being decent.

Dinner, movie night, drinks, game night,hot tub-ing, 
parties, day trips to try something new, or just sitting 
around smoking a bowl and hanging out. It doesn't 
have to be crazy, and it doesn't have to be super mellow.
As long as we have good people around us that's what 
matters, that's what makes or breaks the experiences.....

Weather you like the green to slow down and mellow out,
the clear to get spun and go fast, or the white to just 
go a little crazy for the night, we don't care, and we don't judge.
We believe that everything is good in moderation, everything 
can be used to enhance your experience and your life. 

Send us a message, tell us a little about yourself,
your interests and your dislikes, tell us about the things
that make you, well you. We will respond to you, and if it seems
that this could be a friendship that enhances all our lives, we

Hi, I don't know your situation or your reason for checking out these ads. Maybe you are bored and just get a kick out of how corny, rude, silly, nasty most of them are. Maybe you just need to leave reality behind for a bit. Well hopefully here's one you might consider answering. Like you I'm not here looking for love or drugs or used undies or naked pictures. I'm here hoping there's someone out there who's not looking to change their situation but is missing the excitement of someone new. A reason to look at your phone. Maybe you've been married a long time and the thrill is gone, maybe your husband hangs out with his friends more than you like. What ever the reason (I can give you mine) if you'd like to e mail a bit with someone new. Some one you would have never met (or maybe you will, who knows) then give it a try. If we don't click nothing lost. Hope to hear from you.

So hello, age 43 female here. I've been Salsa dancing for 10 years. Everything from performing, competing and teaching. Unfortunately, the last couple of years, a back injury has kept me off the dance floor. Needless to say, I am having withdrawal symptoms. Currently I have, available to me, an awesome dance studio located in Brighton. If you have the time and dedication to come to Brighton I am looking for a ""Practice Partner"". My last practice partner was awesome and always gave me a challenge and his energy!! But he has since moved away from the area. Although I love beginners, I am looking for someone who I would NOT need to teach, but instead someone who already knows their basics and turns. Someone who we can BOTH challenge each other with new moves and an awesome healthy connection. You may already know me from the dance scene or it's possible we may have danced at one time or another. No no romantic or dating intentions, strictly dancing. Dance is my pill, my addiction and my stress reliever at the end of a long and difficult day at the office.

Let's do this!!

I am just looking for a girl/woman to do things with. Just clean fun companionship. No dating or relationship stuff. Just a friend. We don't need to have same interests as I am open to trying new things. I just want to go out there and experience life. Some of my interests are:
Sky diving, watching movies, reading, libraries, museums, theatres, motorcycles, dirt bikes, theme parks, long drives, hiking, working out, camping. I would like to learn to play the guitar and to bake. I can cook. What are your interests?

I don't really know the best words to use to give the best depiction of me so I'll just throw out some that others have used to describe me. Loving and Caring are maybe a top two. I love people and I love good hearted people. Nice Guy is another. I am always happy and smiling and in good spirits for the most part. I always consider others because I care for people. Now, I just feel like I will be alone again since I am moving to a new city. I am single and I only wish I could find my match partner to build a life with. I want to be able to come home and lay next to and cuddle what could be a platonic friend or there could be more but most importantly I hope I can meet someone in Denver that will make me feel at home and I can hang with when I am free. I love Camping, I want to learn how to shot a gun and a Bow and arrow, I speak a second language, Mandarin. I have lived in China for 6 years. I love group conversation and talking with intellectuals. I want to start this Journey in Denver ready to explore new people and explore a new city. I have some great friends here in Atlanta but I guess I have never had a best friend. I grew up spending a lot of time alone and I guess I want company more now. I've been told I need to put myself out there so this is me trying. 

Best, 




Jay

Hey there!

I'm in my early 30's, and fully admit to loving my dogs way too much! I have lived here for 2.5 years now, and while I have some great lady friends, none of them have dogs. I spend a lot of time hiking in the mountains, going to dog parks, exploring new open spaces, etc. with my pups, and I'd love to get a group of similarly-minded outdoorsy animal lovers together and regularly go to new places with our dogs. I will happily share more about them and myself if I hear from you, but they are both in the 2-5 yr age range and are very active breeds that love either on or off-leash walks/hikes of anywhere from 3-13 miles.

If you are looking for some new girlfriends to hit the trails and parks with, please send me an email with a little bit about yourself and your pup/s. I'd love to get a small group of us together regularly if enough people are interested, so the more the merrier =) Or if just one awesome lady replies, that's fine too.

Whether you live in Denver, Boulder, or somewhere between, if you are looking for a close group of girl friends that share your enthusiasm for dogs and the outdoors, please send me an email =)

My name is Jesse Puga and I own Puga Athletics and Fitness. I currently train about 19 to 23 clients and/or athletes at any given time. I would like to continue increasing my base clientele. 

I am willing to offer discounts in an effort to appeal to clients who can workout during daytime hours (8:00am to 6:30pm). My normal rate is $40 for a general session and $60 for specialist coaching. However, I am willing to take on new clients during these off-peak hours at just $20 - $30 per training session, with FURTHER DISCOUNTS available the longer you train.

Now, no where out there can you join a gym and receive high-level personal training and skill coaching for anywhere near this price, and these will be low stress, one-on-one sessions unless you would like to bring a friend to workout with.

Do you have a desire to feel more at ease with life, no matter what is going on?

Having your Bars run can do just that. There are 32 points on your head that correspond to things like; healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named.

They store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything.

For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called ""money.""

Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it, clearing the space for new awareness to come in.

The creative possibilities for your life begin to open up!

It's been said that at worst a Bars session will feel like a great massage. At best, it will change your life!

Why do I want to meet you?

I want to meet because making that new connection is so intense and exciting and yes even awkward but still delicious. 

I want to meet because when our gazes meet I feel a ferocious rush of possibility. For me to try and deny my attraction and seem unaffected is pointless. My cells all scream. I am reeling. And I want to show you how I feel.

I want to meet because another soul has never had your particular eyes, your shade of skin, tone of voice, your unique scent. No one has ever had your energy and no one ever will and I want to drink it up. 

I want to meet because life is short and I don't want to leave this place someday regretting that I did not reach out to you. I don't want to wonder 'What if I had just been honest about how I feel? Would we have done our dance? Left our mark? Would we have added our play and our joy to the mix?'

I want to meet because there are hidden parts to me. One so tender that wants to show tenderness. One so primal and untamed it wants to make that known to you as well. One so sensual that wants to a awaken your senses. One that thirsts and wants to be intoxicated by your scents and your sounds and your tastes.

I want to meet because I'll admit it: a part of me craves the power to have you in the palm of my hand...quivering, shivering, aching, sweating, longing for bliss, spasming and begging for release. And I would like to grant it.

I want to meet because I'm tired of seeing you without speaking out, without reaching out, without touching, without embracing, without feeling your warmth for a time.

I want to meet even though yes I already have a life and do not want to walk away and destroy it. Still though, life is complicated and this fire inside of me to feel passion and romance won't burn out. The curiosity inside for the unfamiliar and the exotic won't be denied.

I get bored easily at work. It would be way more fun to have a new friend that is super sexy to chat with throughout the day. Perhaps you are just as bored as I am. If you like to flirt, even better. Although I bet I am a better flirt than you are. We can email, text, or snapchat...whatever you are most comfortable with. It doesn't matter if you are single, married, young, or old, as long as you are fun and hot and have confidence in yourself. I look forward to hearing from you.

I know you're out there - I can feel you. Our media and this politically-charged society can wear you down - just like a bad career or daily kids' activities.

We both need a muse - a divine, intelligent friend, catalyst and possibly a lover if sparks fly later. We can be creative, playful and add some humor to our lives. Why not?

I want a spontaneous buddy that likes strong coffee, occasional wine/cocktails, and robust conversation. 

If you are 25 - 45, flirtatious, healthy and are looking for a tall, philosopher type send me an email. Let's go write and play together

Not too much of a night owl. Video games. Very interested in martial arts. Former gymnast. So theres a little about me. Very friendly but also very picky about the company i keep.

I'm about to be evicted, any day now my utilities will be shut off. 
I spent the last of what I had (except for $0.28) to fix my car. It worked.
Then I tried to go to work, which used up the last of the fuel in it. Normally I would have gotten paid tonight, right after working, but it's being postponed. The end result is that I won't be able to refuel until I get paid, which means I will miss a few days of work. This sets me back horribly because I need to make up last month's rent, next month's, utilities, and feed myself.
I know the Craigslist community as a whole seems to hate begging, and seems to eagerly take down any post even hinting at it, but I need help. I figure this help could come in one of two ways; The first would be transportation to work, which would be enough. The second would be the means for me to get myself to work. 
I would be working downtown, and it's not a long trip. The problem is, that I'd have to be there at 5:30 am. I know I'm not the only person who has to get up that early, so if you would be heading downtown anyway I'd love to hitch a ride. 
In the same way, some fuel or funds for fuel would also be immensely helpful.
So, finally, I am begging the CL community (see what I did there?) to take it easy on the flagging, and in return I will pull this abomination of a post down once I've figured something out. Also, nothing contained in this post is prohibited or against the terms of use. You'd have to be a dick, and likely a stupid one also, to flag. 
I need to keep working. If anyone has any lucrative ideas or jobs, I'd be open to it also. 
Thank you

I moved to the Denver area a few months ago and have spent much of that time alone, which isn't good for me, but I find it tiring to introduce myself to people over and over again only to find that they bore me. But don't despair--if you're reading this, you're probably not boring, even if you think you are. Anywho, that brings me here, again, in search of a friend. 

I am looking for a friendship of some sort, whether it's through texting or email or an occasional real-life meet for coffee or walk somewhere or anything, really. I can be difficult to get to know, and difficult to have as a friend, but may-haps I'm worth it. I'm not looking for a relationship outside of the bounds of a friend.

I would say I like deep conversations, but I'm not sure how deep. I like to walk without a destination in mind, often to look at houses. I like to sit on park benches and stare at trees while absorbing the sunlight. I recently took up painting. If I'm particularly bored, I like to knit scarves. I like to read, though I'm not as voracious as I once was. I like to cook and bake, and I sometimes like to vacuum, but only because I don't have much furniture. 

So if this interests you, I await your reply.

I'm a senior in college and have decided on my senior project. What I would like to do is photograph average, everyday women to try and prove everyone is beautiful on the outside.

Last semester I watched a video in class about how people use photoshop to create unrealistic pictures of women for advertising. I already knew everyone does this, but the outrage and hurt from the women in my class really stuck with me. This is for them, and for everyone else, who has ever felt ashamed of themselves.

What I'd like to do is find as many women as I can, all age ranges, all body types, all skin tones, and photograph them. With the right lense, lighting, angle, background, etc, I can prove anyone can be a model.

I would like to do fully clothed, partially clothed, and semi nude, that choice is totally up to you. I can also make sure your face is obscured. And of course, you will get a copy of every picture I take.

If you'd like a free photo shoot, to feel like a goddess, to help me complete my project and to give those fake models a big middle finger, I'd love to talk to you. Thank you.

I'm stuck in my head.

Hello there, I'm a 26 year old female who is going through a 1/4 life crisis. I'm so confused and lost. My life is on autopilot. 

I've lost motivation to change myself and eventually I'll probably just accept the failure that I am. 

I'm 225 lbs. I gained the weight back I worked so hard to lose. Despite having a gym membership and funds for healthy food, I lack the drive to make changes. 

I compare myself to others and come up inadequate. 

I have nothing to show for myself. 

I feel guilty for 98% of every action I do. Slept through my alarm? Yep, I'm a failure. Didn't stick to my diet? I should give up. I find myself lusting after someone? That's gross and shameful. 

If I could sleep all day, I would. I'm not living. 

How do I become the person I want to be? The size, shape, persona, of my dream self? I lack the determination of change, though I desire it so much. 

If I keep going this route, I'm going to hate myself even more.

Please help

Long story short, I am moving and putting my house up on the market next week. I recently stumbled onto a decent amount of pot and I am planning on smoking it all this weekend while watching movies. If there is anyone interested in partaking please let me know. We must meet up in a public place before hand to get to know each other first.

In the header put your fav metal band or any genre of music but it'd be cool to find someone who has similar music tastes. I listen to bands like Bathory, Electric Wizard, Carach Angren, and Watain.

Craigslist is loaded with postings from lonely people, and there are many (especially guys) who are looking for a FWB situation. This generally means that they are looking for casual sex, no commitments. It is pretty shallow and superficial. Unfortunately, it also is a good indicator of how sad things have become: people in unsatisfying relationships, who have found that being with ONE PERSON does not meet all their needs.

I am also in one of those relationships. These things get complicated, and there are numerous reasons not to end it. In my case, children, a genuine caring and love (you can love someone but not BE IN LOVE), certain needs and dependencies your mate may have, and even practical things like financial. This is not a case of verbal or physical abuse, massive infidelity, or general incompatibility. Sometimes you fall out of love, and over many years lose all the spark... you function almost simply as room mates.

So, what are the benefits I am looking for?? In this case, having an emotional connection. Having an attraction where you feel appreciated, noticed, valued; being able to share intimate things, someone with whom a deep friendship can develop. Sometimes, there is a physical chemistry as well, and even the excitement of that feeling is worth a great deal, even if you agree not to pursue it. Not sure if I can go there, but maybe. 

Having these feelings, and the specialness of a close friend, with whom you can share most anything... maybe even finding a touch of that soul mate that you lack.

So this is what I seek. 

A bit about me: I turn 58 soon, retired, fit and decent looking; high energy, creative, witty, intelligent and well-educated, a voracious reader, good writer, musical, good cook and a foodie. I like to talk over strong coffee or a glass of wine. I like long walks on a warm, calm day (does the wind EVERY stop here?). I want us to be mutually interested in each other, our gifts, our life stories... and have similar needs: we both are in relationships but want more. Obviously, discretion is a must.

First of all, let me start out by trying to make a positive and refreshing statement for a post that you would find on craigslist. I am very respectful and capable of NOT being a ""creepy"" guy. You know the ""creepy"" type, the guy that makes you feel uncomfortable because of a comment or unwelcome physical contact. My name is Paul. I'm 28 years old. I'm looking for someone to chat with and get comfortable talking to. I'd like to find some friends to get to know and hang out with at some point. I just moved here from New Jersey. I have three roommates who are cool as hell to go out and have fun with and can hang with the best of them. They are the types of chick's anyone can get along with. Having said that, I am a very social person and am driving myself bananas. There are times where I am all alone and I wish I had more options on people to hang out with. So I've decided to post this message to find a friend. I have a kayak and bicycle. I love to fish but I always put them back cause killing then seems too cruel. Want someone to laugh with and hang with and learn about and just bond with. I hope to hear from someone. Once again this is not for sex, this is just me looking for friends to eventually meet and have a blast with. I don't care what race you are, what your sexual preferences are or how you choose to identify yourself either. Everyone is welcome. I didn't demonstrate it in this post, (because i thought it more important to bring the reader of this post to the conclusion that I'm actually trustworthy and deserving of a chance at friendship) but I'm very sarcastic and love to bust people's chops.

So this is way unconventional but my wife signed me up for bags and gifts thing. And I need to have a launch party. This stuff is mostly designed for women but there a handful of things us guys could find very useful. Also you can buy the girly things for your women or potential women. No one thinks I'm going to have a successful party. I wanna kill it and I thought what better place to do it then a strip club. There will be prizes, drink tickets and hot women. We are doing this to help our son who is autistic get a therapy dog. The dog costs 12k $ so this will prob just be a small part. So I figured why not come out do a good deed and get to see sexy women. Hit me back for more details.

Hello everyone. I'm just going to tell you a story. I was on a road trip and riding in the passenger seat of my brother's car when a semi truck ran right into the passenger side going about 40 mile per hour. I don't remember the accident at all. They had to cut me out of the car with the jaws of life. I just remember waking up and the doctors telling me that they can't treat me at the hospital and they can either transport me to Wichita or Denver. Since I'm from Colorado and my family lives in the Springs I of course chose Denver. 
My femur was broken in two places and I had fractured my pelvis in multiple locations and I had an ureatheral tear. (which is the scariest injury to me!) They put a metal rod in my leg that night. I have to relearn how to walk all over again, but I know that through hard work, determination and faith I will heal up in the next six to eight weeks.
And that is why I am posting this. My family can only visit once a week, if that, and I normally can handle being alone but I find myself getting kind of lonely in this hospital room. I'm looking for a smart woman who can hold a good conversation to come and visit me during the day. 
I am a 29 year old white male with a full beard. I like the outdoors, camping, riding my mountain bike. I love to travel! In fact, I'm going to start working on my dream of being able to travel and make a living at the same time. After this accident I'm going to start living my dream! 
So if you are interested in meeting a nice guy who stands up for his convictions in a non-threatening environment like a hospital room, than email me and maybe we can eat lunch together. You don't need to buy me lunch I'm not a bum, I'll order both of us some good ole hospital food from room service, lol. I'm a smart ass so if you don't like sarcasm you wouldn't like conversations with me. After a couple of emails I'll tell you what hospital I'm at and the room number. I would also like to talk to you first as well,
So yeah ladies, I would like to meet new people and see where it goes, I like making new friends and that's all I'm really looking for. Meeting a person unique enough for me to date would be very rare, but hey, you never know. Thanks

I am looking a woman (40-60) who is in a marriage like mine that has lost intimacy and romance. Mostly looking for others to talk and relate to, not necessarily for sex.

I am interesting, good looking, very successful (well, except for maybe in my marriage?!?). I like to eat, cook, drink wine, talk, walk, read, write, bike, play the guitar, sing, and grow my own herbs for pesto!

Hello; Was just looking with no expectations, really...But, hey...no gain, no pain. Right? lol

Looking to meet single or divorced male ONLY. Pls no married or attached, or separated. Not interested. Looking for someone who is young at heart, with no baggage, or hang ups. 

Ideally, I am attracted to Caucasian men, a bit younger, hard working, and proud, with intelligence and wits.

The very reason for this ad is to find a clean cut type guy with old fashioned values and standards. May be north west has it? Here on the east coast, or N.E. we have none. Nobody to date. I gave up.

I am in central MA, two hours from Boston. I am divorced, professional, young at heart and looks female. I am in my fifties, but not shabby at all...much younger guys ask me out, if you can believe it.
I have pictures to prove it...lol

But, later, please! No pressure. And, I wont pressure you. I can assure you, I am real, I am sane, a I am clean cut, down to earth, low maintenance woman. But, I am also independent, and free spirited.

Can be feisty and direct. I don't shy a way from confrontations or a debate. Not needy at all.

Ideally, I want to find that special guy for friendship and communication first. If we click, and connect, and all goes well...I don't mind to visit. Distance should not be an issue. Agree?

I enjoy nature, hiking, gardening, walks, culture, music, travel, reading, and much more...

So, there...didn't want to make it long...but, don't want to waste my time or yours either.

I guess, I am looking for someone who is on the same wave length.

Anyhow...that's it from me. Be looking forward to hearing from you!

One thing I hate when I receive one line emails with no substance at all. 

I delete. End of story.

Otherwise, be happy to hear from you!

Thanks.

Biking south on County Road 209 outside of Saratoga, WY this morning, I watched a herd of at least 100 Pronghorn speed across the road in front of me!

I am fit, adventurous, aged 50s and seeking similar to explore the recreational opportunities here in the North Platte Valley, Medicine Bow Mountains, Sierra Madre and Snowy Ranges, and these environs generally for biking, hiking, and boating.

I am from Denver but new here in this no-stop-light, single brewery town on two-year work contract (construction management). With most weekends off I plan to explore Southeast WY. If this peaks your interest, you are fit and would consider joining to discover the best here in WY, do respond and I will provide more information.

I don't know what to say, or even why I am here, or what I am looking for. I met the girl of my dreams 14 years ago. I married her after meeting only a few times, I was young and dumb and in love... adopted her 8 month old baby and took him on as my own with no hesitancy. I spent 14 years making sure she knew she was the love of my life. I opened doors, courted her, made her breakfast every morning, found different ways to show my love, flowers randomly every month, etc. etc. etc. We had our ups and downs, and both had our bad habbits but I thought we were happy overall. She said she was. Until one day she left her computer open and I caught a message.... she was about to meet up to screw some other guy she barely knew.....yeah so my world was flipped upside down. I spent years making her feel loved (always felt un appreciated by her) and here some guy was able to almost just walk right in ( she claims nothing happened) i'll never know. so I don't know where I am now. I have 3 kids, I can't turn their life upside down. No one knows that she did this, they all think shes so perfect (I am not about to destroy her reputation with anyone including our kids) but I just don't see the point of trying, and going out of my way to make her feel special. this guy was engaged (nice guys always finish last apparently) so I guess im looking for someone to talk to who can relate or likes to be treated like the center of someone's world once in a while. if you are still reading hit me up. I am 35, have a great career I love camping, shooting, hiking, working out and just about everything.

I can only speak for myself, but I assume I am not alone. 

Women complain that there are no decent guys; that all men want are FWBs or one-nighters, or when a request for a pic is sent, a shot of a man's weiner comes back.

I am an older guy, 50, but still look youngish. All my dark hair, all my teeth, 5'11"", a hint of my young Army officer body remains. 

I met a woman online last week, she said she was European and wanted a nice relationship. I emailed. She thanked me for my mature response. We chatted that first night and she asked if we could meet right away. I couldn't, but figured she was spontaneous.

I made a date for the next Sunday night but had a major project come up and had to postpone. She lives downtown, I said I had an appt downtown Tuesday and maybe we could meet then.

Tuesday noon, I text her and offer to meet her for a light lunch and maybe a glass of wine. On me. Her response:

""What an inconsiderate asshole you are! I just woke up.""

Just woke up? What are you, a dopesmoking teen?

I was taken aback, tried to calm her down, then out of left field, she texts; ""All you Colorado men just want sex, you want to try to fuck me!""

I had a NO TIME made any reference to sex, hooking up, or anything but decent chatting. 

I was very disappointed as I was looking to meet someone for movies, cooking, driving into the mountains, general fun and companionship. One need not discuss sex, if you like each other the sex will happen naturally. 

When I spontaneously meet women, they like me. But I can never wrangle those meets into a date. 

Honestly, I'm beginning to think all women are nuts.

My boyfriend and I just moved here from Florida. I love it here so far, but I know about two people outside of work. All we need now are some like minded individuals to geek out together. 

STOP NOW if you are looking for anything other than friendship. I do not want naughty photos. Not looking for a hookup or anything of the kind. If you are planning on emailing me asking for 'noods' please just forget this post or I exist. Ok now that that is covered back to the actual post lol

We have pets so would prefer if you weren't allergic as we are always covered in pet hair of all kinds.

We are BIG time gamers. I collect consoles, but my boyfriend is a PC gamer. Also love us some boardgames! Would be great to meet someone who loves boardgames, so we could set up game nights. We do not play your typical boardgames though. No monopoly! Warning: he is a sore winner/loser. Don't play with us if you can't handle A LOT of shit talking and competition.

I am a crafter. Mainly I cross stitch for my Etsy shop. I am learning to knit and crochet. I sew, but it is mostly liners for my chinchilla cage lol. I want to try more hobbies, and have a shopping buddy for the craft shop. Be prepared to spend hours in there if we go. 

I bake! Food is a passion. I love to bake and cook. I eat meat, but I don't care if you don't. 

As for reading, films, and such. I love scifi! I read mainly science fiction. I watch The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Girls, Once Upon a Time, Bojack Horseman, The 100, Orange is the New Black, etc. I love Battlestar Galactica and Firefly. I will watch almost any movie or show except I HATE ALL THINGS TWILIGHT AND FIFTY SHADES. Favourite movies: Star Wars, Stardust, Hitchhiker's Guide. I love anime! And I am Studio Ghibli obsessed! 

Please never use the words: Bae, Turnt, Thot, or Fleek. They are not real words. I don't mind if your spelling sucks or even grammar. Use all the short hand typing your want or we can have a conversation in emojis lol just not those words.

I work part time so I have A LOT of free time.

I curse like a sailor. If swearing bothers you I can try to watch my language, but you have been warned. My favourite word is the 'F word' which I say countless times throughout the day. 

I have a few disorders I try not to let get in the way of my day. If you were understanding when I have 'bad days' or 'episodes' that would be super! I have anxiety, depression, OCD, and mild agoraphobia.

My boyfriend and I are crazy immature. So, we would prefer friends in the 21-30 age bracket. Unless you are also immature then 'age ain't nothing but a number.' We do not have kids. I do not mind kids they just aren't for me. I lack the maternal instinct (no it will not come with time and I will not change my mind so please don't say this to me). I am crazy awkward around children. So, if you have kids I don't mind just don't be offended when I get weird around them because I really have no idea how to act. 

I do not care what your sexual orientation, skin colour, religion, or political stand is (unless you're a trump supporter. If you are again forget I exist). But if that stuff matters to you here are my stances on them: I am bi, white, agnostic (raised baptist), independent (Sanders supporter), pro-choice, etc. 


So, now that I have written a novel haha if you think we could be friends send me a message.

I'm sure it's a total CL pipe dream, but I thought I would rattle off a wish list for an email/IM partner. She would be:

-- Educated (bachelor's degree or above)
-- Too much of a grammar/literacy nerd to engage in a lot of abbreviating
-- Somewhat brainy (interested in books, current events, art, etc.)
-- At least minimally interested in sports (playing and watching)
-- Flirty, but in a mature, compelling way
-- Level-headed and non-stalkery
-- Interested in periodic emailing throughout the day

Bonus points for the following:

-- Love NPR
-- Enjoy coffee/tea

Hi, 

I am couple months out of a long relationship, and find myself with no female friends. I am missing that part of my life. I am not looking for a hook up or a fwb situation, just a laid back down to earth woman who wants to go out and enjoy the state we live in. 

I am an awesome person with a kick ass personality, down to earth, understanding, philosophical, enjoy good banter, going out, eating at random spots around town, or hitting up a random bar or show. I am always up for something fun. Most importantly I am not a douche. And if you must know I am definitely easy on the eyes. I can keep up in a conversation, and have tons of useless information in my head haha.

You and I are here for the same reason. Like me, you are married, but the thrill is gone and passion is dead. Like me, you are lonely and want to meet someone new. You're probably nervous -I know that I am. You tell yourself that you're only looking for a friend. But deep inside, you know that you are really looking for a lover. Maybe you're not looking for a physical affair, but you're definitely looking for more than just friendship. I am too.

Let's chat and see what happens. Have a beautiful day!

Maybe you've thought about moving to the PNW, or maybe you're just bored and want a new friend to exchange emails with. Whatever the case may be, I'm available for email or chat.

Due to my working a night shift, I pretty much have to resort to trying to meet people online. I have tried to post locally and haven't had very much luck. My theory is that due to living in such an ""IT guy"" concentrated region, there is huge competition when it comes to meeting women online. Or maybe I'm just not doing it right? Who knows. I've tried OkCupid and that seems even worse.

A little about me...

Being that I live in Seattle, you may have me somewhat figured out. I smoke weed, I drink coffee, I work in technology, and I'm progressive. I have LGBT friends and family. So, we may not mesh well if you're religious or conservative, though I'm open for debating stuff if that's your thing.

I work in IT for a popular retail company. As I mentioned, I work a night shift which leaves me fairly isolated, however I only work 3-4 nights a week, so that's nice because it allows me time to work on music and do other productive things like play video games and watch movies. I like working nights, being awake at night. It's peaceful and sort of like a whole different world. I do stay up until around noon, so it's not like I don't get to see daylight ever, but this schedule does not seem conducive to making new friends.

I play and record guitar, bass, synths, drums, and vocals. I don't have a band right now, but I'm hoping to put one together soon, and I'm hoping that playing my music live will help with meeting people. My music is sort of indie rock with some electronica. My musical tastes range from jazz like Ella Fitzgerald and Miles Davis, to bands like Tool and Radiohead. I was raised on The Beatles, Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Abba, classic rock. One of my favorite 'contemporary' bands is Pinback.

I like getting out and about when I can. There are so many great, beautiful places around Seattle to explore, hike, go camping, etc. I also enjoy traveling when I get the chance. I have been to Canada and Scotland and I'd like to visit many more places, take your pick.

I'm getting back into shape and I feel pretty good about it. I have a home gym where I work out about every other day. I'm also eating healthier; lots of vegetables and fewer carbs/sugar. I'm growing my own garden this year, too, so I'm excited about that.

So, yeah, that's a little about me, now how about you? Feel free to ask me anything, too. I look forward to hearing from you (ʘ‿ʘ)

I do not mind to hike solo but the place I go to is does get a bit steep towards the top, so I figure I should try to find someone who shares my interest of hiking and is not afraid of heights. I dont mind going to other trails too, but there is one spot I love going to that some would say is only for hard core hikers. I actually bought trekking poles and other stuff specifically because of that trail. I am in my late 30s, adventurous, divorced, content, fun, easy going and have no expectations for anything. It is a plus if you are 420 friendly but not required.

Lately it seems most of my buddies aren't motivated enough to go to the gym on a constant basis, so im lookomg for a fellow fitness buddy to workout and trade sport massages with. 

Im straight (girlfriend absolutely sucks at giving massages), in decent shape. I like to work out four to six times a week. I was getting a massage once a week however it got be way too expensive.

So if it sounds like something you'd be interested in shoot me a message telling me a little bit about yourself and attach a picture and we'll go from there. Please be drug free and in decent shape.

One of the things I miss about a significant other is going to brunch on Sunday morning. The few girlfriends I have either go to church or have boyfriends and don't get out much anymore.

I love Snooze, but don't like to wait an hour for breakfast. Maybe you have a smaller, less crowded favorite breakfast place. I enjoy good coffee, conversation and meeting new people. There has to be someone else out there looking for something similar.

I'm 40 something, don't do drama, won't stand you up and can talk about a wide range of topics as long as it isn't sports. Although I do have an opinion on Peyton Manning given the recent news that's come out. Now I've probably lost most of Denver, but that's okay. I'm interested in quality, not quantity. Please be willing to meet somewhere in Denver, I live in the city and am not much for the suburbs.

So my work is taking a few of us out and everyone is bringing their wives and girlfriends. My ex fiancé decided she needed to ""find herself"" a few weeks ago so here I am trying to find someone fun to take to this work party. Nothing crazy but we're going bowling. Free food and as many drinks as you want. I don't want to be the only guy there alone. So if your fun and open to hanging out and getting drunk with a bunch of people you've never met so I can avoid explaining why I'm there alone, that'd be sweet. Really just looking for someone who wants to have a good time. Don't get sloppy drunk though, that shit ain't cute and my boss is gonna be there. Haha if you can handle that. Shoot me an email. Pictures are cool too.

This hurts me. Does it hurt you too?

I sent you to Tacoma, WA for help with your cancer. You wanted to go there and only there so I bought you the bus ticket and three days worth of food for the road. I would have gone with you but legal restrictions at the time prevented me from leaving. Plus, your a marine, you love your independence. Even if I was free you would have asked me to stay and I would have been compliant. So, I gave you my number, the bus ticket and the food, we said goodbye, and we went our separate ways. 

Its been over 6 months and I don't know anything. Where are you and how do I reach you? Are you ok? Did you get the help you needed? Are you alive? 

The chance of you seeing this is very slim but I'm holding onto a glimmer of hope.

I am a lovely woman with a magnificently huge and loving heart. Been up the Street and back more then a few times so during my travels I have learned that friendship is necessary before the romance begins. Why not??? 100% Italian, successful, well-read,kind, great humorous soul, love of music and the fine arts. Don't ask me if I want to get laid, and please don't flash your penis at me... Lolol...

Mature couple looking for friendship and fun and also same room sex, maybe touching each other if all agree. ..PS female is straight. we live in the SE area of aurora around iliff & tower. Its been a while since we've met anyone that we can really call a real friend and now we are finally beginning to look. we are fairly active and fit especially in the summer but winter time is hard. A few of our interests are going out to dinner, watching movies and games can usually be a lot of fun. We like fires and hot tubs, and shooting pool. Brad loves to ski and jane would like to learn. this sounds terrible so far but in the warmer months...Apr.-Oct. we belong to a pvt lake 60 mi E of aurora where we spend a good share of our time up there. we have a 21 ft boat and a 5th wheel and are really looking for our friends to come up and join us. so I guess we're looking for people that enjoy boating as we spend our time wakeboarding,waterskiing, wakesurfing, tubing you name it! In the evening a fire or just watch movies and it's nice taking the boat out at night as well. we are looking for fun outgoing respectful couples that just want to have fun and hopefully end up with a true friendship. we are not drinkers..we do smoke but plan on quiting soon and brad will smoke weed once in a while for medical reasons. we are young at heart,mind, body and retired, with a lot of free time. so if this stupid add interests you please give us a shout out. you have nothing to lose and maybe we will end up with a good friendship. Any age is fine..it's only a number and please send us a pic or two so we can see who were talking with. Maybe we can talk and meet in time to watch the super bowl together?Have a great day..peace out..PS as far as the hot tub suits are optional,how ever if you were uncomfortable without one we would wear one not to be offensive.

Hi - I would like to go see Deadpool and get some dinner. I think it would be most fun to do with some one .. I don't really have any list of requirements. I am not worried about your age or race or marital status. I do think we both should be grown ups. Probably best if we both speak English.. My Spanish is horrible, but we could try if its your only language.

I'm looking for someone that would like to share a ride or at least meet up at Loveland to ski.

Also, I don't judge your abilities and welcome all to inquire and will let those more experienced know that there isn't a single spot on the mountain I won't go.

I am looking for a friend to add to my life. Working all the time, doesn't really allow me to get out and make friends. I am engaged to a great man and have been in a relationship for almost 6 years. We have a 4 yr old son as well. I do not smoke or do drugs. I do drink on occasion. We moved here from FL almost 2 years ago and love it here. I do have a membership to a 24HR Fitness gym and would love a partner to go with. I go to the one at Arapahoe and S Parker Rd. I would like someone that we can grow and be friends and IF it all falls into place, we can be more than friends. I am a very girly girl and would like the same. I am a 39 year old caucasian. I am not judgmental and expect the same. I am in an interracial relationship and see all people the same and expect the same. I am about 185 pounds and need to lose quite a bit of weight and looking for that friend that we could motivate each other. I am very romantic and gentle, soft and nurturing. I am not looking for a man, any ""butch"" or anything like that, as I am happily in a relationship with a man. And yes, he may start off by just watching us play, but will join in at some point. Hopefully making this a perfect poly relationship at some point. So with that being said, you MUST be bisexual. I would love someone to go out and have coffee, take a walk, sit and chat and watch football and more. If you have kids that is great. If not, that is fine too, but you MUST accept that I do and he is my world. If you have any interest, please send pic with intro about yourself. 

Not looking to just photo swap and/or endless emailing. Will want to voice verify or even video verify soon after chatting.

I am looking for a best friend. A guy or a girl, doesn't matter to me. The only thing that matters is that you have a good heart, be non judgmental, be tolerant of others (have no hate for color or orientation), have a love of animals. I don't eat anything from animals and try to keep a cruelty free, green home. Someone with a similar frame of mind would be great. I am kind of an introvert and ISTP/INTJ on the MB personality type, which makes it a little hard to be outgoing to find friends. I am better texting but I'm not into all the abbreviations. I know lol and brb but that's about all I care to know or use. I just want to have a friend that has my back, and will know what to say to make me laugh or calm me down. I don't have kids and don't want any. If you have kids that's cool, its just not my thing. Please feel free to ask questions to get to know me.

Its slightly cheaper to register as a 'team' -- but also might be a fun opportunity to meet a person/new running partner.
I am somewhat new moving back to Denver, work in finance, lived in Boulder before -- but always love doing 5ks and meeting new people. I know this is craigslist and not always the best place to meet sane people, but will be a fun day to race, grab some beers and show off great outfits.

I've done one these before with no success, but I'm all about second chances and I'm gonna give this another try because why not. I've got nothing to lose, but only hope to gain a friendship.

So I'm just gonna put this out there and say that I'm seeking a legitimate friendship. I don't want a hook up or a relationship. While we don't have to meet, I'm okay with a pen pal type of thing. 

I'm super nice, I get along with almost anyone. I'm kind, sweet, and totally down to earth. I love almost all types of music, love movies. My idea of fun involves going out or staying in being lazy. I like deep conversations, long walks, cooking, exploring new interests. I'd like to take up something artsy like pottery or painting. I'm not artistically inclined at all, but I'm intrigued. Pop culture and current events are topics that I'm interested. I'm a walking contradiction at times, but I make up for it with my awesomeness, haha. I can be funny and corny jokes is one of my favorite things. 


Anyway, if anything sounds appealing, feel free to email me. Let's get to know each other!! I am real, and I can prove it.

Hi. My name is Kalia, I'm 23, and I have agoraphobia.

What that means, practically, is that I have a hard time leaving my home. It makes it pretty difficult to meet people, as you can probably guess.

Commonly asked questions: No, I don't work. Yes, I get my groceries delivered. No, staying at home is not ""relaxing and fun"". Yes, it's very lonely. No, I didn't make a decision to live this way, I have a condition that requires it. Yes, I'm working very hard towards my recovery.

I'm looking for a friend. Someone who will like me and spend time with me in spite of my limitations. I have trouble leaving my home, but otherwise I'm a normal person. I like action movies and comedy specials. I'm a huge nerd. I love comic books and superheroes, as well as magic and fantasy. I play a lot of video games, especially RPGs like Skyrim and Fallout. I read fanfiction. I'm into Game of Thrones and Harry Potter, Arrow and The Flash. My favorite cartoon is Steven Universe.

I want to meet someone who will bring over blankets and pillows for a movie marathon, or help me try a new recipe for the first time, or go for long walks around the neighborhood.

I have a lot of free time on my hands, and I'd like to spend some of it with a new friend.

Please put your favorite color in the subject line!

Hi,

I am seeking someone fun who likes to be outdoors and participate in outdoor activities. This is platonic. Can include lunch or breakfast before or after or beers. I am just a busy guy who is wanting someone fun to do outdoor activities with and make friends with.

You should like to do one or all of the following activities. I am in very good physical shape and like to push myself and keep active and fit.

-Road cycling (more paved trails than roads)
-Mtn biking (light to moderate intensity)
-Running and jogging on paved trails, open space trails and at Wash Park
-Indoor spinning and fitness
-Racquetball
-Hiking
-Skiing
-Working out a Red Rocks

I'd prefer someone in their late 20's or 30's, or early 40's just so we might have something in common. I like people who are on time when we agree to go do something and have a good attitude about the activity.

Please send some basic info if you reply and what you like to do outside for fun.

Thanks

I don't usually find myself in town on Friday nights very often. I guess this is a rare exception. With that being said, I've been wanting to try out Bellwether on Colfax near my house.

I'm really lonely and looking for a female friend to talk to and hang out with. Age is not important. Race and marital status is not important either.

I'm 35 y/o, have a nice job, 6' tall, athletic build, and have a nice personality. I'm outgoing too :)

Include a photo and tell me a little about yourself when you reply then we'll go from there.

I'll try to keep this simple.
I'm looking for an ""Activity Buddy"" (NOT a ""F*** Buddy""), who lives in my area. Someone interested in going for dog walks, runs or hikes. -- I have a big puppy with a lot of energy. . .
I figured someone would be interested in hiking Green Mountain. I'm hoping to make it a regular part of my weekends. Maybe someone else is looking for a dog walking partner?
I'll usually be going Saturday mornings. If you wish to join me, hit me up for details.

Greetings,

I am a married white male that is seeking a new friend to chat with. This could be either via email or kik. I very much enjoy getting to know new people and am open to talk about anything and everything under the sun, or even not under the sun. ;)

I am a genuine nice guy that I feel is a bit of a natural flirt. I just greatly miss the rush of learning about new people.

If you are interested please drop me a line with ""February"" in the subject to weed out the spam. A face pic would be nice as well but not mandatory.

Thanks for your time and consideration.

I have manners, don't cuz, non 420 but I'm learning to accept people  that do since it does seem to help their health. I'm spiritual and open minded.

I am looking for a best friend. A guy or a girl, doesn't matter to me. The only thing that matters is that you have a good heart, be non judgmental, be tolerant of others (have no hate for color or orientation), have a love of animals. I don't eat anything from animals and try to keep a cruelty free, green home. Someone with a similar frame of mind would be great. I am kind of an introvert and ISTP/INTJ on the MB personality type, which makes it a little hard to be outgoing to find friends. I am better texting but I'm not into all the abbreviations. I know lol and brb but that's about all I care to know or use. I just want to have a friend that has my back, and will know what to say to make me laugh or calm me down. I don't have kids and don't want any. If you have kids that's cool, its just not my thing. Please feel free to ask questions to get to know me.

Hey everyone! 

I am an attached female, living with my partner and our two pups. He is very into gaming, board games and video games, and I am very into art of all forms. We share a love for Doctor Who, Adventure Time, A Perfect Circle and music like it, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and weird hats. We are both individually very quirky (Gemini and Aquarian). He is completely sober and always has been, so while I don't drink or smoke around him, I do drink and smoke (420) on occasion. It is important for him to not have those substances used around him. I am 22, and he is 30. 

When I bought my 3 day passes for Comic Con in June, I realized that we are at a point where we don't have any friends close enough to go to con with, or to share a hotel room or anything like that, as we did last year. So, I'm reaching out, looking for some great people to get to know, who might be interested in going to DCC with us and getting to know us. We both really crave having good friends in our lives. 

Shoot me an email and tell me some of your interests, if you've ever been to DCC, and what you might be looking for in a friend.

I go out of my way to make that obvious, as I don't want to have you or I waste our time.

Next, I want to mention that I am straight and in a relationship at this time - Though I could care less if you're gay, straight, bi, or what not. Now let's get to the general parts of this posting! 

About Me: 25, male, white, blond, blue eyes, et cetera. I drink on occasion, do edibles (cannabis) occasionally as well but nothing harder - Please don't do anything harder and don't be a heavy smoker (cigarettes, can't stand the smell personally). 

My Hobbies: I'm a Systems Engineer/Administrator, so technology on the whole is my passion and career. I also do enjoy gaming, mainly FPS, racing or sports games. Sports wise, I'll watch just about anything but I am particularly into NBA. I'm also trying to get a little more active, such as making more trips up to the mountains to go hiking and going out to play basketball/sports. Plus getting out to dog parks (when the puppy is old enough and in better health) and other dog friendly events/items.

What I'm searching for and why: I don't believe in having a lot of 'friends' who I barely know and barely know me. I'd rather have a 'best friend' or a couple of really close friends. Due to moving a lot growing up and just moving out here soon, I don't really have any out here. I've stopped being in denial, as my 'best friend' was always making me pick up the tab and would flake out on hanging out at last minute (without even letting me know, just silence). I'm not saying I want to not pick up tabs or anything like it, I just don't want to get stuck in a friendship that's 1 sided and not a true friendship.

Well, hopefully after I laid all this out there - There's some of you who read this that will reply and we'll hit it off. If not, then I hope you find whatever it is you're on here looking for.

Ok never tried this before so here it goes.

I'm Mike, a fun laid back chill guy to be around. Just recently moved back to Denver and looking to meet make new friends. I get along with everyone so really doesn't matter who you are I'm sure will click.

My hobbies consist of going to the movies, out with friends, playing pool/ bowling. I love taking random strolls around town. Traveling and exploring. Trying new restaurants and places. I'm pretty much up for trying anything at least once (NOT DRUGS THOUGH!!!) and yes that includes 420.

Ok, now that's out of the way. You can often see me at car shows, walking around the mall, downtown or pretty much checking out some place I recently heard about. I'm always keeping an ear out for upcoming events. Summer is my favorite time of the year just love the outdoors, but I do enjoy the winter to point. Sorry not a huge fan of the cold...which is funny because I'm a born and raised native here in Colorado.

Here little bit more. . ..

Books: MAGS (Car, Computer, Comic, Geek, Music, etc..) History Books, LOTR, The Hobbit, Mystery Thrillers, pretty much anything really.

Movies: Comedy, Action, Disney/Pixar, Historical.

Music: Mostly Alternative Rock, EDM, Trance, and a little Rap/R&B. (I HATE HEAVY METAL!!!!)

Shows: F1 Racing, Top Gear (BBC), Game of Throwns, Person of Interest, Pawn Stars.

Movies: I LOVE MOVIES. I love cuddling up at home and watching a movies, love going to the theaters to.

Foods: Sea foods, Italian, Asian Cuisines, Indian, My own cooking!!!!. I love trying new restaurants.

P.S. Don't ask me who my favorite artist/bands, actors/actress are. I really don't make it a point to remember there names. Just the names of songs and movies.

Promise not to go crazy, I don't need a sugar daddy or a place to live. Won't go blowup your phone because you have a life and didn't text me every five seconds. I love music listen to almost everything but bluegrass and folk nothing against them just not my thing. I do have a twisted sense of humor so if you take yourself way to seriously I am liable to piss you off. I am a gamer not omg have fifty million games but always enjoy killing zombies or monsters.

I'm curious. Have you ever felt like you didn't want a relationship but not just countless encounters? Ja feel. I'm looking for the same exact thing. I'm terrible, absolutely terrible at describing myself, so send me a message!

What if? What if you had a really down to earth guy in your world who legitimately took time to hear you when he listened to you? One who didn't try to solve your problems, but who took time to cherish the way you work through them? He was honorable to your needs without being a burden. He got you stoned and played you a band you never heard before?

And what if, when this cool ass dude recognized how hot you were, let you watch him fantasize about how awesome you are while you watched?

Never any ""crossing-of-the-lines"". Totally platonic, just with a rebellious disdain for whatever the difference is between rubbing my shoulder or my throbbing cock in front of you. One is definitely more interesting to watch, you can't deny that!

I'm interested to hear from any woman who looks good in a dress.

Human beings need touch, we all need to be held, and no one should be denied from receiving such wonderful medicine.

I am a 30 year old male who lives in Arvada CO. I have brown hair, blue eyes, and a teddy bear build. I am offering my sweet loving touch to you. I offer one-on-one, non-sexual, cuddling, and touching. This includes spooning, holding, hair caressing, hand holding, and talking/therapy if you want that too. I am a great listener. I really do care and want to support YOU. I am easy to talk to, non-judgmental, open minded, and extremely nurturing. We don't have to talk either, could be strictly cuddling.

We all need this type of touch therapy. We can discuss what you're comfortable with (some people may just want me to play with their hair and listen to them). Together we will create safe boundaries before we touch. I also offer massage and cranial sacral work for an additional fee. Imagine getting a wonderful massage and then being held by the person who just massaged you.

I do this work because I love it, because I believe in it. I have seen the power that loving, nonsexual touch and connection has to heal and transform lives. Let me be a reflection to you, to shine back your own perfect light. I want to make this world a better place and that starts with YOU.

$40 for a 60 minute snuggle session with me. I can come to your space or you can come to mine depending on your preference.

If you are interested send me some information about yourself and we can book a session. Images are available upon request.

Looking forward to connecting,


Mike

I'm just a guy in search of an amazing woman. We all have our ups and downs in life, and admittedly I'm in more of a ""down"" time. I miss having someone to talk to and hold. Someone to share the times with, good and bad. I miss giving and receiving affection and massages. Hell, I miss sex... But that's not the most important part.

For starters I would love to find a great conversation. If more develops then all the better. I'm open to just about any possible situation and/or type of friendship/relationship that suites us and our lives as they are currently.

If it matters:

I'm taller than 5'2"" but shorter than 6', not fat or skinny, booksmart but not entirely streetsmart, but I do have common sense. I'm single, live alone, no offspring, no pets at this time. No tats or piercings, but I am hairy so I guess that can count... But not overly hairy ;)

Please tell me about yourself and be willing to contribute to the conversation, possibly even lead it at times. Thanks for reading, I hope you have a great rest of your week :)

I need someone to help explain to me what happened. I wish I ask this of friends but most would find me thinking about this so much absurd. I'm sure I'll be over it in week but right not it's staying in my mind. I met this girl this past Friday. It was out at a bar but under unique circumstances. I was with a friend, we all got to talking and having some drinks and ended up at my place. I don't recall this but she told me later that my buddy finally got a clue that her and I were into each other and left. We ended up going to her place because she has a dog and had a great night and morning. Normal things would have ended at that but she had the 3 day weekend off and so did I. I ended up staying until late Monday morning and the only reason I left was because she got called into work. It was a whirlwind and very strange but in a good way. For me it felt like we condensed weeks, if not more, of dating into 3 days. I know it wasn't the same as dating but it was in how much we opened up and shared with each other it felt that way. Although we didn't make specific plans, we talked about how having her dog overnight at my place was okay and she mentioned I should visit her at work. She nannies so its and fairly casual environment. Also, in two separate conversations we both invited each on trips we were planning. It was that kind of vibe. I want to say that I'm not inexperienced either. I'm not desperate or lonely. She doesn't seem any of those things either. This was truly a strange and once in a lifetime experience.So, I think it's pretty reasonable that I thought we would be in contact and even start seeing each other. Well, it doesn't feel like that's happening. 
Since, Monday it's been virtually radio silence on her end. I haven't been bombarding her with texts nor have I said anything too serious or even asked when I would see her next. She responded some on Monday night but yesterday, I sent a couple and nothing. Today I sent one and nothing. She did say on Monday that something was happening at work and she may need to stay a few nights there. She also said she'll typically work 12-16 days. I have no reason to doubt that and when I was with her she wasn't all over her phone but did seem to respond to most messages. She obviously wasn't working then either. I just think two days without a response is making a statement. So, do you think wrong with that? 
Assuming I'm right and she's blowing me off, I'm left wondering why. Was it just a weekend fling? Maybe we got so close, so fast that it scared her off. One factor may also be her ex. She mentioned him a few times. My assessment on that is that she still feels a connection. She hasn't gotten as close to a guy since and she feels this bond over some of the things they went through. 
The reason this bothers me is because I like her. She is beautiful, fun and we had great chemistry both physically and personality wise. I don't come across that too often. I know I'm very self-protective. If I don't hear from her soon, any feeling I have will shut off. I think that's a shame but it's the way I work. I feel kind bad right now. 
So, as a woman, let me know your take on things.

Looking for new friends in the Denver metro area. I work 40ish hours a week and when I am not busy taking care of other people's issues, I enjoy my time off (weekends and holidays) hiking, camping, spending time outdoors, sports, sports bars, gaming, movies, and traveling to name a few. I don't smoke, don't do drugs, but I do drink on occasion. Could use some new friends who enjoy hanging out and grabbing a drink or 2 after work or gear up for a hike this summer. Feels like summer already eh? Anyways, I'm 40, white male, bi, and currently in a relationship going on 14 years. I was in the Navy, worked at a theme park, and have spent the night on the streets of Edinburgh Scotland. I've come face to face with Beverly Crusher, and fought over a fly swatter from Billy Joel. If you wanna know about these adventures drop me a line and perhaps we can laugh about our own adventures someday.

Ok, had my interest piqued by an ad I responded to and then had the whole thing fall flat. Thing is, it did get me excited enough to motivate me to write this.

I'll get to the point, I'm looking for a writing partner. Nothing serious, I don't want to meet, just want to either trade stories or collaborate on one. It can be fantasy, sci-fi, urban fantasy or even erotic.

All I ask is that you go into this as honestly as I am and have enough grasp of the English language to either keep up with me or even kick my ass (and therefore make me a better writer.)

In closing, yes I would prefer a woman to trade ideas with because most guys with my interests are too much like me and it just falls flat.

Hi there CL ladies. I would love some company this weekend to go for a stroll at a local park, maybe a low key hike. Not looking for an excuse to ask you out, just want someone down to earth, kind, and a sweet personality. Maybe you walk your dog, or just want company. So if your looking to meet a fun adventurous guy just looking to meet someone new, and maybe make a nice friendship then look no further. Age, looks, etc. mean nothing to me, your inner beauty will win me over anyways. Hope someone will enjoy my company this weekend. Isn't it supposed to be nice out?? Pic available but let's just get outside and enjoy it. I enjoy the outdoors and all it offers, coffee shops, bookstores, photography, hockey, and much much more. Maybe we can chat about the things we enjoy in life. I will check emails and we can chat/text and hopefully enjoy time together.

Hello all. Thanks for reading my ad. Like the add says I'm a small town country boy, making my way back to the big city. Work and my divorce being final is what's bringing me here. I'm looking to meet someone who might have the same interests as me, willing to show me around town. I'm not necessarily looking for a relationship, or anything sexual, but I was with the same person for a long time, I wanna have a female friend. That's a start.. About me, I'm 39, 5'8. 180 lbs. Brown hair and hazel eyes. Covered in tattoos, with an athletic build. My family is Spanish, apache Indian, and honky from my mom's side. I like anything country. Rodeos, concerts, bbqs. Fishing and camping,, fourwheeling. I'm a sucker for a honkytonk bar with a pool table and juke box. I like bowling and darts, and yes even bingo. I find I like just about anything other than sitting in front of the TV. If this sounds like someone you wouldn't mind showing around town, hit me up.. And yes I do have three kids, and even a grand baby. I'm set on my professional career so I'm not a dead beat. Looking forward to hearing from you. Jeremy

Hello ladies, my idea of a perfect friend is one that.
1. Last more then a few days to see if we connect.
2. Doesn't give the same boring questions. ""How are you"" ""whats up"" ect, come on mix it up alittle :) no one word respondes, not alot anyway. 
3. Is alittle sarcastic, snarky, doesn't mind a mild text fight, or being made fun of (mildly) and give it back.
4. Likes to text anytime, I do work nights. 
5. Doesn't mind talking to a married guy, I'm 48, still cute lol
6. Will be the first one to text, not all the time.
7. Funny, witty.
Is this to many? If you want a dedicated text friend to talk to whenever about anything, text friendships can be very fulfilling, you don't see the person but know alot about them. I'll make you laugh some, I'll always be there for you, I'm always near, a text away, and i really do care, give me a shot. Hope to hear from you.

I'm just a guy in search of an amazing woman. We all have our ups and downs in life, and admittedly I'm in more of a ""down"" time. I miss having someone to talk to and hold. Someone to share the times with, good and bad. I miss giving and receiving affection and massages. Hell, I miss sex... But that's not the most important part.

For starters I would love to find a great conversation. If more develops then all the better. I'm open to just about any possible situation and/or type of friendship/relationship that suites us and our lives as they are currently.

If it matters:

I'm taller than 5'2"" but shorter than 6', not fat or skinny, booksmart but not entirely streetsmart, but I do have common sense. I'm single, live alone, no offspring, no pets at this time. No tats or piercings, but I am hairy so I guess that can count... But not overly hairy ;)

Please tell me about yourself and be willing to contribute to the conversation, possibly even lead it at times. Thanks for reading, I hope you have a great rest of your Tuesday :)

""You're a fun-loving, goofy, nerdy, sometimes annoying, extremely loving, too kind for your own good, moron of a genius."" I was having trouble describing myself with out bias, so I asked my niece to describe me, and the above was her reply... Cue the 'Captain Obvious' line. I often speak without thinking first, I'm not great with diction or being vocal, and I'm possibly a bit insane, but who isn't? Insane, I mean. If you stop for a moment, and look at our world and humanity as a whole, without allowing any bias or delusions to cloud your judgement, it's clear that everyone is (and I believe this is the clinical term) absolutely batshit crazy. (Cue the 'Holy run-on sentence, Batman!')
For the most part, it's not the creative, positively constructive,'forever change the world and/or the way people see it and/or each other' way. Mostly, it's the kind of insanity that manages to pass as sane to most people, simply because it's how most people are.. I personally think that sanity is overrated, but then again, my insanity is why I'm determined to change the world. Life is an amazing, wondrous, beautiful, captivating, and still indescribable thing that so many people take for granted. They spend their lives hounding over material things that they use to define who they are, or they live with the goal of dying, believing (or maybe just desperately hoping?) that a book written (and rewritten several thousand times, and copied from even older, yet similar books) by uneducated, ignorant men who were trying to comprehend, and explain, this mindblowing thing we call 'life', is something that everyone needs to believe in and if they don't, then those nonbelievers will be punished in some way after their death, for the rest of eternity. Meanwhile, most of those people don't understand their own beliefs, or the texts that their beliefs are based on. If people want to believe those books, all the power to them, so long as they don't try to shove it down other people's throats, don't repress other people's beliefs, and ESPECIALLY don't try to use their books to take away the rights of other people. To some, what I've written thus far will translate to: ""I hate religion, religious people are all horrid and evil, I am a worshipper of Satan, etc etc,"" but I honestly don't care what your religious beliefs are or aren't. If it inspires you to be a better person, to help others in need and makes you feel happy about yourself, then that's what matters. So long as you aren't being a dick about it (for lack of an equally simplistic phrasing), then I'm not going to care. I'm very open minded, though in the words of Bill Nye, evidence would change my mind, but for now I'm fairly certain in the knowledge I currently possess. 
On a more personal note, I'm definitely a nerd by every definition. I love science, math, history, video games, comic books (I absolutely love debating characters, and there's very little I don't know concerning the DC and Marvel Universes), and pretty much everything from Nintendo. Pokemon is definitely an 'obsession', though I use the term loosely, as well as Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, pretty much anything SciFi or of the supernatural nature. My dream is to be an architect, to build my own successful business, and create something that people will look at with awe after I die. I plan to create a unique hotel chain that celebrates humanity and both our diversity and unity, and donate 30% of the profits from every hotel to a multitude of charities and foundations I plan to set up, to help those who need it, to give people a second chance or just a chance that they never would have had, and set in motion a wave of change that I hope will spread across the world. Being good isn't always easy, and that's why heroes are hailed as heroes; they set an example as something so drastically different than what's normal.. But all they did, was do the right thing. What does that say about the world? 
I've been here since September 30th, and I still haven't met anyone. Really need some friends. 
If you're interested, you can email me, Kik me (HailTesla), Snapchat (TrainerNerdcore), or text me (seven twenty- nine ninety-eight - thirty-one fifty-three). I don't care which, honestly, but text or Kik will probably get the fastest response.

Ok so maybe you're not technically a ""single"" mama, maybe you are happily coupled with an amazing partner. Yet somehow you end up feeling very alone the majority of days. It's your first time on this amazing trip called parenthood yet somehow it's not exactly what you expected. A little more isolated, a little more monotonous. You feel guilty for even thinking this way. Shouldn't you be positive? I mean, most of the mamas in the world would kill to have the basic freedoms and privileges that you take for granted. But no matter. You look around and see so many mamas and babies but so few connections are made. Sometimes as I walk around Wash Park with my LO I see other solitary mamas and I want to say, ""hello over there! How is it going? Are you lonely too?"" But of course I don't. It would be odd. 
Let's walk this path together and collect others along the way who feel like they are somehow doing this wrong even while making all the right decisions. No mama needs to be lonely. We should support each other.

I'm a 38 year old, white, attached looking for an online chat friend/email buddy for the work week and maybe weekends. I'm married but I'm feeling kind of lonely in my marriage and would like to chat with someone in a similar situation, though it's not a requirement. I am only looking for a lady with a very high education(at least a bachelor's degree), I prefer MD, NP, or PhD.
I believe that deep conversations with the right people are priceless. 
I am only looking for a pure frindshipe, so if you're looking for a lover or a sexual relationship, please don't contact me, since I am not the right person for you.

and I don't eat rhubarb. (never have ... never will)
Uh, but seriously folk....my feet were never designed for walking. Unless it was somewhere in the shallow end of a swimming pool. Driving a car, keeping the beat to music, and stomping out roaches? Yes. That's their intended purposes. So Yes ! I am not into long walks. Especially not in the barrio (at night). If you really want to know what I'm into, I'd have to say good 420, good conversations involving the esoteric, good chess games, and soytenly good music. OH. Did I say soytenly? Scuse. My accent hasn't disappeared altogether, yet. So here's a retired guy who has time on his hands. And even though science tells us that all time is simultaneous, I still have lots of it.
And my inner social butterfly wants to get out.

And I'm stuck inside all day.

And I gots the blues. Yeah. I'm blue. So blue . . . .

Now while I don't have any recent pictures of myself, here's a copy of me when I was a baby.
I know. I know. I was REALLY big for my age. 
And I remember when this picture was taken. I didn't want to go to this artsy farsty place, to begin with. But you know when you're just a kid, you really don't have much of a say in the matter. So they took me to this ""happening"" and set me on the floor (as you can see in the picture above), and went to look at those stoopid pictures. There I was. Sitting in the middle of the floor, with nothing to do. I was depressed. yeah. feeling blue . . . real blue...so very blue.
And by the way, did you happen to notice how my toes were sorta curling up tight-like? Ya see - while I was feeling blue, I was also pissed off. And there's only 2 things that make my toes curl up like that. When I'm pissed off, and when I'm in the final throes of some hot sex.

AND IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE I'M HAVING SOME HOT SEX NOW, DOES IT ?!??!??!?!?

Hi. I'm fairly new to the Denver area and looking for friends to ski with and share transportation, and maybe share lodging for multi-day trips. I have an Epic local pass and want to hit Breck and Vail mostly, with maybe a few days at BC or A Basin. I probably qualify as an advanced skier, trying to get better. I ski mostly blues and blacks. I can make my way down most double blacks, but not necessarily with style. I'm still working on mastering the bumps. If you're more advanced, I can try to keep up; if you're less advanced, I can be patient. Or if you just want to share transportation and then go off on our own to ski, that's cool too.

I'm a single guy, open to skiing with men or women. I don't smoke anything and am looking for other non-smokers, or at least people who don't indulge when we're together. I live in the Centennial area, but if you live elsewhere in the metro we can figure out a place to rendezvous. If you're interested, let's swap emails and then maybe grab a beer or coffee and see if we're compatible.

I would love a good friend that meets the following... But won't deny a secret desire for more...

I work damned hard, and my hours kind of stink, so I will be the first to admit that I'm a bit lazy at home. I would like to find at least a good friend to text/talk with often...

I would love to find my soulmate. A passionate, intimate gal interested in a fulfilling relationship filled with passion, intimacy, shared back rubs, a bit of kink, understanding, and whatever else fills our fancy. I don't mind going out from time to time, but all the time is not my thing. I enjoy the occasional adult beverage, am not big into weed (But not against it at all), and do smoke cigarettes (But vape most of the time these days).

If you enjoy nice quiet evenings full of communication, togetherness, passion, sharing, and maybe accepting that I'm a touch lazy at home, then I beg you to respond. :)

I'm 30, single, 5'6"", average build, very giving both physically and emotionally, selfish at times, no kids, no pets at the moment (RIP :( ), and am looking for an amazing woman to spend the rest of my live with in a supportive, generous, amazing relationship. In the meantime a good conversation o r friendship would suffice.

So, if you are interested, please reply back with a bit about yourself and tell me your favorite Super Bowl moment :)

It has been written that you learn best via teaching others.

I've been dating quite a long while, in between some long healthy relationships. Also have been studying psychology and sociology for many years. At this point I'm not confused or surprised by much. 

Presently open to some random conversation. So hit me up to find out why your dating profiles on okc pof etc, or posts here are not working. Or things like the time tested question of what the fuck was he thinking, etc.

I'm from out of town. We don't know each other. I've never been to Denver. 

I'm looking for a fun flirty woman to become modern day pen pals. 

I'm married and it is probably better if you are as well. Must be discreet and open to sharing. 

Let's have some fun. Share stories and desires. Things you'd like to do and things that you've already crossed off your bucket list. 

Email only or Kik

I've been lying about my house today, wanting someone to talk to or something to do, but I wasn't sure whom or what. Anyway, I've decided I just want somebody to talk to tonight. So, send me an email. Tell me about your favorite book, something cool, or something that's excited you. Tell me a joke, a story, or how great Deadpool is so I can be super jealous that I haven't gotten out to see it yet. Just, you know, let's chat.

I'm a confident and well spoken professional traveling in Denver on business. 

Work is done for the day and so I'm throwing this out to the void - I'd prefer not to spend my free time in a hotel room. 

What I'm looking for is a smart, witty woman that would enjoy the city with me. What that entails is up to fate. Could be dinner in a quiet restaurant or drinks at a loud bar. It could also just be a long walk to get coffee. 

Whatever we do, I hope it includes great conversation and a real, albeit brief, connection. 

If any of this resonates with you, please reply. I look forward to meeting you.

So I'm looking for a date Saturday night. David Neil is playing a live concert Saturday night at 8:30. I have one extra ticket and would love some good company! 

Please respond with ( Saturday ) in the subject line. 
Also please a recent picture. Thanks hope I can find a fun date!! ✌🏽️


So I'm kind of an odd mix of : country, surfer, meets GQ ?? 

I'm new to the area and looking for an adventure buddy,that can hopefully turn into something more. Let's go have drinks, catch a concert, go long boarding at the park, can't wait to learn how to snowboard too. 

Born and raised in central Florida, I spent the last year in Hawaii finishing my wine sommelier course and of course surfing! 

I'm into Sports, football and baseball are my two favorites, live music, if you don't like country music this will never work.. 
lazy beach days, good food and even better wine, I'm kind of a wine snob ... I love to cook, I'm kind a foodie. 
Game of Thrones or a good book or a great movie. Spearfishing, surfing, long boarding, hiking or anything outside in the sunshine.

No set preferences other than a non-smoker.

Love is defined as a profoundly tender, passionate affection for another person. 
Love is a feeling of warm, personal attachment or deep affection. 
Love is an affectionate concern for the well-being of another person. 
For decades, people have theorized that love conquers all. That love is all you need. 
People have dreamed about it, searched for it, sacrificed for it. 
Love is the theme of almost all movies, novels, songs and poetry.
Love can be given or received. It can be seen and felt. 
But love is one of few concepts that can be modified. 
Most things are set it stone. Most things are defined, clearly, so that people can understand. 
But not love. 
Love is arguably the most complex idea known to man. 
Yet, people believe that they know so much about it. 
They admit they've felt it, found it, lost it, had it, been in it.
But it's only those who can hold onto it that truly understand its definition.

Never tried to touch you or asks you to touch him. Never tried to get you to sleep with him or pushes you to take things to the next level... Always looks out for you, gives you cash and gifts without ever expecting anything in return.

Would you come visit? Every time you let me touch myself while we are in the same place together I will give you $50 cash.

Before you go thinking I'm ugly... I'm very in shape and very handsome and clean cut. I'm engaging, honest, loving and very natural.

I'll be honest- I'm down to just smoke you out cook you food and take care of you when you come chill with me... But if you let me play with myself while you're there watching me (as long as I'm fantasizing about you) I'll also give you $50 every time you come over and let me do this.

You stay dressed the whole time. I will swear on my Mom never to touch you or ask you to touch me. I'll be respectful and honest and cool always look out for you when you needed since you're letting me explore this fantasy with you.

I have a paper heart, hence the title. I've been hurt way too much by way too many people I thought would always be by my side. I digress. I'm trying not to put my heart on the line every time I'm attracted to someone, hence the title.

I'd like to find a cool stoner chick that doesn't mind cigarettes also. I drink socially, but am out of the ""party scene"" for the most part, too old for that. The age number factor doesn't matter so much as the maturity factor does for me. I'm as drama-free as I can manage, and an easy going person. I would like to start by hanging out. If we connect in another way, cool and if not, we at least made a new friend.

Hello, my name is Carlos, there's nothing I like doing more than playing video games, watching decent movies / tv series and hitting the gym. At times it feels like watching a good movie or being in a competitive and challenging game online is better than sex. I wish to find someone who can relate.

I normally workout alone at Athmar Rec center but lately I've been meaning to find someone who can push and motivate me in the weight room and vice versa. I don't need a trainer and I don't wish to train anyone seeing as most newbies tend to quit in less than two months.

I'd prefer to workout with someone on my level but it's not a deal breaker. My dead lift max is set at 400 pounds, my squat is 350 x2 reps and my bench is 100 pound dumbells x3 reps.

I'm a vegan, I don't drink, smoke nor do drugs. I'm always calm I never raise my voice nor lose my temper, I dislike loud noises and loud people so I tend to go out of my way to avoid sport fans. I'm an atheist and I'm introverted by nature so I prefer to spend time with only one person at a time and I'm a total homebody on weekdays, on Weekends I love going out some where random (museum, restaurants, downtown). 

Please be under 25 years of age, it's cool if your're gay or bi but the odds of us doing anything sexual are very slim. Please reply with your favorite movie or video game in the subject line so I know you bothered to read the article prior to replying. 

If the add is still up I'm still looking. I will reply to every email with in the same day.

Hi,

So it's Valentine's Day, but otherwise, it's just been one of those lazy days at home alone. Anyway, I figured I'd hit up CL to see if there is anyone else out there who's in the same boat. I'm not looking for anything specific, just someone who, like me, is up for meeting someone new to share their time with. We can just chat online for a bit and if there is a spark, we can take it from there.

So a bit about me I'm 28, 6'1"", average build. I enjoy denver and the outdoors and nightlife extensively and also easy going and always up for a new adventure. At this point, I'm basically looking to meet new people and do new things. Plus, I'm totally awesome so there's that. Anyway, if you too are bored and maybe a bit lonely, hit me up. Hey, it might be fun!

Later,
Charlie

Hi there

I'm a 31 yr old married guy that is unfortunately in not the best of relationship. The passion is gone and I feel isolated. I am finishing up school and I work full time but when your with your spouse 12 hours during the day it gets suffocating. Please don't judge. If you don't agree then please move on. 

I'm a romantic and nice guy looking for a woman who understands where I'm coming from. Someone who wants those butterflies again. I am an artist as well and I would love to have someone who can talk about art too. I'm a big teddy bear looking to cuddle and hang out when schedules allow.

Are you stuck?

What if working out and proper nutrition was more than just a Means to
lose weight and get into shape?

What if it was a catalyst to shifting your life?

In my years as a trainer I have noticed one amazing thing about
purposeful movement and good nutrition. It gives people to confidence
to do amazing things with their lives!

People step up into better engagement in their jobs, relationships, in their lives! 
Of course a healthier body shows up along for the ride, but are you ready to really shift your life?

How about a complementary exploratory session to see what is possible?

Would love to find a man maybe 65, who would enjoy some company (maybe weekly). He would live alone, and he would enjoy someone to come over and sit with him, watch a movie, or just talk.
Perhaps after we are comfortable with each other, he would like me to sit close to him, or he might enjoy the movie better having his arm over me. I'm sure there's some older gents out there who would like to enjoy some company once in a while. This is not a sexual posting, it takes time to build a trusting and rewarding friendship. I enjoy having a couple beers on the weekend, and I do enjoy a cigarette, but would refrain from smoking around you.

Hello,
I am looking for a new and interesting person to communicate with. I find myself surrounded by people all the time, but am not having any deep and meaningful interactions. You know the feeling right? Just like Bill Murray in the movie ""Groundhogs Day"". I live about four hours northwest of Denver, but decided to cast a little larger net so posted in the Denver area. 

About Me:
34 years old
Married, and that's going spectacular....
Sarcastic (reference previous line)
Love 80's movies
No interest in watching sports..... at all
Always taken my own path.....
Never had any interest in drinking, smoking, or drugs
Love to laugh and listen to comedy

You:
A human that can form complete thoughts, listen, and respond. 
Not a stalker.... On second thought, never had one of these so what the hell, you can be a stalker.
Just someone to connect with, doesn't mean we have to be real world compatible or anything of the sort.

Look forward to hearing from you.

I probably shouldn't even call it home. I sure do live there but it doesn't feel like home. Its just a house I paid way too much for. I dont feel welcome. It's like I'm their pet they bought at the mall, took me home and are now clueless as to how miserable I am. 
I need friends. I work nights then go home to sleep as much as the household will allow. 
This is not a life I feel I deserve. I feel used and under appreciated. 
This should probably go under the rants and rave section but I want more than to get this off my chest. Somebody give me a reason to not go home.

I have plenty of good friends in my life but not too many gay friends. Yeah, its great hanging out with my straight friends but it would be nice to find other guys like myself who have the same interest when it comes to the same sex. No offense but not really looking for feminine guys. I live a pretty discrete life so it just fits. The crowd I hang out with doesn't provide an opportunity to meet other gay guys like myself or that I would ever really hang out with so that's a bit of the dilemma. I am not looking for sex....particularly. Mainly looking for other laid back drama-free masculine gay guys who are fun to hang with....if other things happen then they happen but I am NOT looking to get laid here as top priority.

I am down to hang out, grab a beer, kick back, play some playstation/x-box, grab a movie, food, hike, gym, theater, art shows, travel, etc....love trying out new stuff.

I'm a good-looking guy
masculine/discrete
fit
non-smoker
educated graduate
gym rat

If any of this sounds good then by all means feel free to drop me a line with stats and pic and ill return mine....I'm mostly looking for other guys around my age with the same interests so just keep that in mind.

Hello everyone. I'm looking for real genuine friends. I'm still new to Denver. First, let me start off by saying. If you are too shy, don't want to meet, have no time because your are attached to your man's hip, please don't response. I'm interested in meeting people that are serious. Also, I'm straight, so not into any girl time in that way. Don't waste your time! I'm single, no kids, work hard but like to play hard type of girl. I'm spontaneous and outgoing, whether it be sports, lounges, events, nice bars, concerts etc....... Love adventure and traveling. I'm up for anything fun, just ask. Lol. I love reggae and soca, can't help that cause I'm Caribbean:) But I do listen to other music. I'm open to all people from all cultures. If we click we just click. Please be between 28-38. So we can have things in common. Hope to meet real people!!!

Hello! I am looking for someone to email/chat/kik/text throughout the day and on weekends. I have a great job and I do get very busy during the day at times but I also need a distraction so my life doesn't feel like it is all about work. I have a wide variety of interests and I love getting outdoors but I also enjoy cooking and staying in. I am not looking for a relationship as I do not have time but I am looking for someone that has a great sense of humor, is down to earth and is willing to get out of their comfort zone and have some fun with life. I am friendly and outgoing so if you want to chat or have any questions, then say hi!

Exactly what I said, trying to expand my circle of friends. Im looking for new friends to hang out with, girls or guys no matter to me as long as you have something to bring to the table :) I have lots of close friends in my life, I'm not lonely per se, but I am feeling the need for new inspiration, new experiences and new perspectives in my day to day life.

About me: I am female. I am employed. I am funny, artistic, intelligent, sarcastic, genuine, creative, curious, different from most. Heavily tattooed myself, love tattoos! Do we have anything in common yet? I am in my thirties, very much attached heart wise....not looking for anything like that. But I love meeting new people! Seems like I haven't made many fun connections on the path of life lately. I want new people to 420 with, make art with, have drinks with, laugh with. Feeling the same way?

I will want to do the usual before meeting up to see if we're mutually legit....a few emails, then text, then maybe meet up? Let's see how it goes!

I won't be able to smoke with you though... my career prevents that.

Hey ladies! How would you like to earn some fairly easy cash?? I must warn you, you might think it's a bit crazy haha but hear me out. All you need to do is have fairly good ""self-control"" :)
Here's how it works: You will be asked to drink a fairly large amount of your choice of either water, tea, juice, soda, beer, etc. within a certain amount of time. Then your money making opportunity will begin! After drinking all that liquid obviously you will need to pee, but the longer you can hold your pee the more money you will earn!!!!
5 dollars for every 10 minutes that you can hold on, that's $30 an hour!!!

I told you this would be a bit crazy but really you can see it is pretty easy money! If this sounds like something crazy enough for you to try, please feel free to send me an email. We can chat for a bit about the details of this, and when/where it would take place. Again, this is a completely legit offer, and only email me if you have a serious interest in perhaps trying this out.

Hope to hear from you soon!

I can't honestly say that I wouldn't take it further thn just platonic chat, but I can honestly say that I'm fine with just chatting. As a matter of fact right now I'd prefer it was just chat. I'm not looking for a therapist, or to be one. I just want some fun dialog. I don't care what you look like, or what your marital status is, where you live. I do think we would have more in common if you were closer to my age and married too. I do prefer you are female and I am not gay or bi. I'm open to discuss anything, even politics or religion. I would even entertain a little flirting, but that isn't my goal. I merely am looking for intelligent conversation to help pass a few hours. If you just want to bash me for being married and chatting, please pass. I would likely get bored pretty quickly.
What's on your mind today? Do you just need to vent? I will offer an ear, without any strings. Maybe you heard a good joke lately. I could always use a laugh. I will try not to judge you, but I will say that I'm usually opinionated.
I am real. The weather is going to be ih the 50s to mid 60s for the next six days. I won't reply if you don't reply specifically enough to convince me you are real.

Hi,

Thanks for taking the time to read my post. For some time now, it's been clear my circle of friends has grown smaller, and those I do have are shifting. I am feeling less connected than many years ago when we began our friendship. Though they are dear to me, I am finding myself longing for a connection with another who values not only intellect, attending to physical body's needs (e.g. exercise, sustenance) but also has a desire to be better than he is today. I am seeking someone who finds gratitude in the smallest of things (e.g. the sunshine, the water, the contributions others have made to his life) and wants to share in that kindling of a new friendship to create new opportunities of gratitude and sharing

A little bit more about me: Single, blk, gay (though you do not have to be), 41. I like intimate coffee talks and smaller venues to get to know others, non-drug user, non-smoker to include 420, rarely drink. I also enjoy reading specifically books on dreams, hiking, exercise, good company, good movies. I find that for me it's not about the activities but the people I share those activities with that determine if I am having a good time.

Who I would like to meet: people with life experiences that have strengthened them but have also provided them with humility, those who know there is more to life than just the daily grind, those looking to connect with quality individuals and have their lives bettered for knowing another human in the world, those who have a great sense of humor but is also kind in their humor, and those who can challenge me to being a better person as I will challenge them out of my commitment to support others in being the best they can.

If interested, please say hello. Until our paths cross, I wish you all the best life has to offer.

But possibly more depending on how well things go and whatnot...

I'm a 30 year old, single, white male, 30 years old, and am interested in having a conversation. My intent is not anything beyond a good conversation about whatever you like, or what you may want to vent about, but I'm not opposed to developing a friendship, relationship, or anything in-between...

I love talking about the Broncos, crying about the Rockies, and sports in general. I'm also a geek/nerd into the anime and sci-fi stuff, but don't live my life based on it.

Having recently moved from a rather secluded community on the west coast (where my family has been established for generations) I have escaped a life that went on for over 25 years!. My father taught me & my sisters & then handed my over to a cousin whom I later married. I was given to several of my dad's friends and he encouraged my husband to use me in the same way. I have pictures and videos of a rather surprising amount of these activities that I thought was perfectly normal when I was freely participating in them.

I'll keep this somewhat simple if I can. I'm in the middle of a divorce, have three kids who I split custody with, and I've tried the dating game...it sucks. Guys are either liars, cheaters, bums, or just want to screw me. So I'm taking a break. 

I just want a friend. I don't care if you're married and want to vent about marital problems, single and need a friend too, going through a divorce and want someone to compare notes with...whatever your backstory, all are welcome.

Just to be clear, I'm not looking to hook up, talk dirty, have an affair, meet at all, or even see a pic of you for that matter. I just want a pen pal, and preferably with some common interests. 

Here are some of mine:
I love Sci-fi and Horror movies!!!
Music of all kinds but love rock, hip-hop, and house/drum and bass the most
I'm a hardcore gamer and love all genres of games and game types. 
Italian food and a good beer sound like a perfect night to me.
When the weather is nice, I love to try and put the controller down and go outside. Hiking, camping, canoeing, kayaking, swimming, going to the beach...
I have a raunchy/over the top/nerdy sense of humor, and I've included some pictures that reflect that

So if you need someone to talk to, feel free to message me. 

P.S.- I'm African American if that makes any difference.

So married 10.5 years, things just seem to be slipping away these past few years. Ever get that feeling? Like you are not needed, yet taken for granted. Left out of the loop on everyday life events and kids stuff?

Maybe you are the one doing it? Let's talk and go from there. I know it's not helping my situation. 
Please put the number of years you been married to weed the spam. Thanks!

I'm attached, not in a good situation at all. She cheats, I've caught her. I'm just getting all my sucks in a row before I bail. I'm a head working man. I'm tall, muscular build. I'm funny and have a passion to laugh. Just looking for a female friend to talk with. Text, or possibly meet. Not looking for anything more at this time, because 2 wrongs don't make a right. So send me a message let's talk. Age race marital status not an issue. And if you like I'll send a pic. Have a good day

Although I enjoy working, the sometimes mundane tasks it requires makes me want to stab myself in the eye. Monday thru Wednesday tends to be especially hard. I have come up with three possible solutions to pass the time: (1) fall asleep; (2) listen to coworkers gossip and drama; or (3) go to CL to try to find someone fun, intelligent and sane to correspond with. I think option #3 is probably the worst idea, but probably the only option that will allow me to get through this. 

While I'm open to the possibility of a coffee/tea buddy or getaway driver in the future, for now, I am just looking for an email/text buddy kind of thing.

Anyway, I'm a fairly fun guy. I tend to get people to laugh easily. And I have tons of time to kill. So please say hello. Help me keep my vision.

I enjoy riding and walking around lakes and streams.
I usually bike on bicycle trails in the Denver metro area riding between 15 and 30 miles. I ride slowly. My average speed is between 10 and 12 miles an hour. I have ridden around the Aurora Reservoir, Chatfield Dam, Standley Lake, Barr Lake, Cherry Creek Dam, Sloan's Lake, Bear Creek Lake, up and down the Platte River to Confluence Park, the Cherry Creek Trail, the Clear Creek Trail, and the Highline Canal path. 
I walk in open spaces in Jefferson County, Boulder County , and Douglas County. I hike between 2 and 15 miles. I have been thinking about walking up Mt. Bierstadt and walking into Lake Abyss this summer.
I drive all over Colorado mostly day trips and an occasional overnight trip. I mostly drive in the mountains and not so much on the eastern plains although I have done both. I have driven over 23 mountain passes in the past two years. I still have some more to drive over. Occasionally I do some four wheel driving.
If these are things you would enjoy doing, please get in touch. One thing that may make me difficult to get along with is that I am very impulsive and impromptu. I will sit down at night and decide to go for a bicycle ride, a hike, or a drive the next morning. Then I get up in the morning and am usually gone by 9:00 a.m. For example, last night I decided I wanted to drive to Ward today. This morning I left at 9:15, drove up Left Hand Canyon, back through Nederland and home.

I want to be super clear about that but for the last few months i've just been really, reeeeaaaaaly lonely and would love to meet someone who might be in a similar situation or at least understand what i'm going through.

I do well enough with my leather work to take care of myself. I just want a friend.
I would like to find someone that is lonely like me that could use a friend to help pass the time. Age is not all that important, nor is race.

I am a busy person so I'm not asking for huge amounts of time, but a friendship where communication can be frequent. I'm not looking for sexual content.

My desire is to make a good friend, a confidant. Someone I can message goodnight to as I nod off to sleep and hopefully wake to a good morning message from. A friend who lifts my spirits and who's spirits I can lift. I'm not interested in being a therapist or finding one. I am driven and passionate and open and honest. 

I'm in a situation I cannot change and loneliness can sometimes be all consuming.....but I know the future is bright and open to all sorts of great experiences!

I would prefer if you have kids so we have that shared experience. Please be between the ages of 48 and 62. I really love conversation and hope you do too. One liners won't get a reply.

Please don't write if this is not something you can do or are wanting. I do hope to hear from you! Bring on the conversation and new friendship!!!!

Hello CL world!
I'll start off by saying a little bit about me. Firstly, I'm a 24 year old female longing for deep connections whether it be through music or the thirst for friendships who aren't strictly superficial. I care deeply about a multitude of things so you must have a big heart as well. I despise labels, jealousy , drama, and deeply narcissistic females. I love creativity and music is my life. I'm aware of the things in life that get overlooked . A simple touch means the world to me. 
Im quite eclectic. Can be introverted at times. But I'm usually super easy to get along with.Drink occasionally, smoke 420 occasionally, hookah often. Rather you not smoke cigs.Your pic receives mine .I'm like a hexagon there are lots of sides to me so if you find this ad interesting send me a message and we can flip an empty page on our book and begin some interesting stories. Let's get to know each other for a while before we meet. Write the name of your fav flower in the subject line.

A little about me. Forgive the I's not sure how else to describe. 

I'd rather spend a night at a small coffee shop, local place, or at someones elsess place chatting or watching a movie vs going out to the club or other loud scene. I am intentional with my friendships and relationships but find it hard to understand surface relationships.

I'm just looking for a someone to share time with and get to know. This takes time so I think it may be best to realize it is going to take a commitment of a month or so to get there. In my mind, you can't just expect a big friendship in 5 hours. 

I have some morals and values I hope to find a friend that has some as well. I have some things I am passionate about I will share that later. 

No pressure, looks mean nothing to me. Patience in friendship that is the only way you can get to know someone. Just my thoughts. I am finding that difficult to find. Hope this works. I still think of myself as young. Adjusting to being in my early 50's. It is the new 30.

Hello,

I am new to the Denver area and I have a very difficult time making friends so I decided to try out Craigslist. Currently what I would love to find is a group of people.. or hell even one person... who watches WWE so I can stop watching the PPV's alone. Fastlane is coming up and I took the day off from work so I could be home for the event. I have the network as well as a place to watch the PPV, or I'm definitely ok with traveling! I'll grab a six pack (if smoking is your think I'm down for a few bowls as well :) and we can watch our favorite athletes put their lives on the line for us!. 

I am a pretty down to earth guy, I just graduated from college with a Bachelors in Human Biology. A little about me, I'm 23 years old and have a pretty great sense of humor. I find it difficult to make friends because I struggle a bit with my identity, being a gay Mormon was very hard growing up and it seems to be still affecting me even today. I am a masculine acting gay guy who lost a lot of his male friends when he came out and is looking to rebuild. I love my girls though, and if there are any female WWE fans out there, definitely hit me up as well! 

My main goal is to maybe get a group going to meet up for the PPV's or maybe even some Raw's or Smackdowns depending on availability.

Anyway... hope someone gets back to me on this!!

I am an African man who has been living in Colorado for three years now. I would like to make friends with women from Africa, any part of Africa. I haven't met that many African women here. I just want to be close to my roots. I admire African women for their intelligence, hard work, beauty and respect. I enjoy intelligent conversations, discovering new things and just nature in general.

I came here to ask for advice because i dont know you and you don't know me (yet). 
My marriage was never good, including a meaningless divorce but when my wife passed away just over two years ago it hit me hard and things in my life got really bad. I basically trashed my entire existence including but not limited to losing my home, a great career and more. I even lost just about every good thing in my life except for my dog and the love and support of my kids. 
So i decided to pick myself back up and it has been a slow crawl back but im getting there. I worked hard at some not so great jobs and got me a car and as this was happening i kinda wished i could find that someone that would make me happy, but have not taken the steps or given it proper thought; i kept saying to myself i am very happy and content being by myself and doing a good job of rebuilding who i am. 
Recently i sent out my resume to everyone i could. I got a job in a
field paying twice what i wanted, a great deal more than expected. I past my state exam and am in training. Doing great for myself, right?
Today we went to train a someone's house, a normal appointment and well the client was cute. Shorter than me, thin, About 12 years younger than myself and then she begun to grow on me as the appointment went on. She had an awesome personality, she was very smart, great smile, funny, witty and it made me really want to ask her out. But shes a client. Anyway what do i do? 
Or do i really want or need someone? If not her do i look for someone like her or am i ready to look. Am i setting myself up for disappointment trying to even try to look. Should i stay the course i am on now with concentrating rebuilding myself. I dont know how to answer my questions and so many more. Please chat with me or just simply give me the advice i should hear!
Thanks, confused?

I am really, really burn't out on this cold winter weather. Meanwhile, I have been curious about exploring the beach towns, and mountain towns of Cali for a long time. I know the weather may not be ""hot"" there, but it surely will be warmer, and it would be a nice change of scenery. I am posting in the platonic section because I am not looking for anything casual, but rather a deeper connection with a beautiful open minded girl or woman. So, I figure a week to two week long road trip, perhaps longer if we hit it off, would be an excellent way to get to know each other. 

I own an RV (which has two beds in it btw) so that part of this adventure is already spoken for. I also am a writer, and a producer, and this trip will ""double"" as a casual promotional trip, where we would visit local retailers in random towns. (this would take up about 2-3 hours of time, per day on random days. 

I am a conundrum of many colorful ideals and am only interested in someone with an amazingly open, beautiful mind. I am also pretty active. I enjoy Paddle Boarding, Rafting, Hiking, Biking, Long Boarding, Surfing, Yoga, Fishing, Camping and Disc Golfing as often as possible, so I am only also interested in someone who is active, and enjoys the outdoors. If you are interested in Ayuaschsa, or have experienced it, that will be an interesting topic, to share, I experienced it for the first time a year ago in Costa Rica which is my home away from home. If you are into Eastern Philosophy, or Shamanism, then we have a few more things in common. I am also a bit of a Conspiracy Theory Oracle...or as I like to say, instead of a ""conspiracy theorist"" I am a ""Reality Querist"" No rock goes un-turned... 

I also love live music and love to dance, so we will be dropping in on a show or two along the way. During the Spring and Summer Months, I love going to festivals, my range of music varies from, Bluegrass, to Side Trance, from Jam Bands to Reggae, and many genres in-between. I am 420 friendly BTW and I can only hang out with others who are because Cannabis is the industry my books, and products are wrapped around. I drink but very moderately, as in perhaps a 6 pack per week, or less... I eat healthy to, no red meat, and minimal processed food, open to vegans or vegetarians of course. 

I am intentionally being vague about who I am, or what kind of relationship I dream of, as the person I dream of is as much of an anomaly as I am, and she will most likely resonate on a deeper level just by the things I did mention in this add... Mystery is key to life, without it, I get bored, I hope you do to. I have plenty of pics to share once we trade an email or two to see if the vibes are there...

Recently, my wife has been in a funk for a variety of reasons. She hasn't been following through on our New Years resolution of eating/living healthier and, as a result, has gained some weight. The combination of that and her somber mood has caused me to be less attracted to her of late. 

How do I bring this to her attention without being mean or hurtful? I've tried to be supportive but this is starting to take a serious toll on our relationship. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

My husband and I have been living in Denver for about a year and a half now, and I really haven't had much luck making friends here. We moved here from Florida where I was stationed. I was active duty Air Force for 7 years and now serve in the Air Force Reserves. I am also a full time culinary student at Johnson & Wales. My husband is a nurse practitioner and a hobby machinist. We both love anime and go to San Diego Comic Con every year. We also workout and go hiking and biking often. We are not religious and people who are make us uncomfortable.
About Me:
30 years old female, avid anime lover (ask me about my toy collection!), dog lover (I have 3), happily married for 8 years, I'm quiet at first and takes me a little while to become comfortable with other people (never sure whats okay to say to other people, I'm very sarcastic and I think I'm hilarious (I'm often told I'm a little too mean), I do not drink, smoke or do any drugs what so ever and would prefer a friend who is the same, I am obsessed with makeup and frequent Sephora and Ulta on a semi-regular basis. I enjoy going shopping and it has been a while since I've been able to have a girls shopping trip (malls, shopping centers, yardsales, second hand stores, etc). I do have children and am still not really comfortable around children yet ( I have no motherly instinct and borderline on being emotionally dead). I love cooking, baking and looking for and trying new recipes, I collect art from different comic conventions and am slightly obsessed with the Nightmare Before Christmas.
My favorite T.V shows are Charmed, Big Bang Theory, 2 Broke Girls, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. My taste in music is very random (country, Jpop, Rock, classic rock, 80's music, mowtown, etc) I think that should do it for now. 
If I seem interesting, feel free to email me.

Hey ladies,

My husband, myself and our son just moved to CO about 3 months ago. We're originally from Knoxville, TN and this has been a huge transition for all of us. Thanks to my husband's new job, I am able to be a stay-at-home mom with our beautiful 2 & 1/2 year old son. That being said...I haven't met or spoken to anyone (except my husband's employees) since we moved here. I'm very shy...which doesn't help. I would really love to meet some other stay-at-home moms or moms in general...my son is such a huge part of my life and I don't want to sacrifice time with him for selfish reasons.

I would love to make a friend, since I don't know anyone out here.

I'm super sweet...get to know me :)

Hi Craigslist perusers :-) I'm thinking about taking advantage of the warm weather ahead and heading out to Utah for some camping, canyon exploring, and off-roading in my Jeep. I wanted to go this coming weekend, Feb 12th - 14th, leaving early Friday and coming back Sunday late afternoon. Though the following weekend is also supposed to be in the upper 50s to lower 60s so that might work too if no one is available this weekend. 

A little about me: My name's Dave, I'm 34, live in Edgewater, a NY transplant. I work in the IT recruiting industry down in the Tech Center. Love adventure, exploring, road trips, travel, hiking, camping, canoeing, backpacking, and the downtown nightlife! 

What I'm looking for: just a fun, adventurous companion that has some of the same interests. A lover of outdoor adventures, road trips, random and spontaneous ventures to anywhere.

If you're interested, write me back and let's meet first and talk details.

Later!
Dave

This might sound like a cliche but I can't understand why it's so hard to find a normal girl to hangout with and have fun with. I guess women are so use to getting hit on that they think ever guy is just trying to have sex with them. Don't get me wrong I like to have sex too but what are we going to do the other 20 hours in the day? LOL!!! I'm looking for a girl I can laugh with, hangout with, and yes have sex with if I'm being honest. I believe I'm a good looking guy (Not conceited by any means) and I am in pretty good shape. I have a great career, make pretty good money, and have my stuff together. So if any of this sounds intriguing to you shoot me an email.

Super Bowl Sunday is here once again, and statistically it reigns as the one day each year with the highest incidence of domestic violence reported. There are cases every day which are not. Adrenalin, alcohol, testosterone and/or drugs can be a dangerous combination to women and children. You never have to be ANYONE'S victim, and you deserve better. If you know someone who may be in a potentially violent situation, please give them the number of the local women's helpline in case they need it. The number for the National Domestic Abuse Hotline is 800.799.SAFE (7233). Every woman has the right to live free of fear and we must help each other stay safe.

I know this is a long shot, but I'm looking for a woman (any age) to be a companion on a xc bicycle tour I am planning for this spring. It will be unsupported (we carry everything we need) and tentatively I'm planning on going south to north, but that's not set in stone. Thinking of Galveston Island, TX to upper Michigan via the Natchez Chase Trail to Tenn. starting around mid-to late April. I did a supported xc trip from Seaside, OR to Cape Code 2 years ago that took 58 days and have done several week-long unsupported trips over the last 20 years. I am not a super athlete, but fit enough to average 50-70 miles per day. Some longer some shorter depending on weather and some rest days. If you are reasonable fit, have your own equipment (touring bike, panniers, etc), have the time (1 month minimum), are easy going, and want an adventure let's chat and see if we might be compatible. Experience is helpful, but not completely necessary.
Pictures are from xc trip in 2014. Yes, I did have more than 2 shirts!

Hi all,

I am looking for a friend that is female. Not a relationship for sex but for good company to relax with, eat dinner, catch a movie, hike or go to the gym. 

Myself, I am 30 years old and I'm proud to say that I have my shit together. I'm foreign, a true gentleman, a loyal friend and I treat people how I like to be treated (which is hard for some people). I like to laugh alot so a sense of humor is important to me. 

I don't know what to expect from this post but I don't have anything to lose and could possibly gain a friend.

I'm curious to see what kind of response I might get. Lol, we will see

Hello Denver,

I don't live in nor around Denver, I just wanted to see who in Denver wanted to shoot the shizah with an SSBBW across the country.

I'm at work and nothing is happening. I'm bored. I have officially won minesweeper 3 times today and have decided it's time for perhaps some communication. 

I like to laugh. If you're funny, we'll get along fine! I am NOT looking for a hook up or to meet or any of that other crazy talk. 

Talk to you soon!

I work damned hard, and my hours kind of stink, so I will be the first to admit that I'm a bit lazy at home. I would love to find my soulmate. A passionate, intimate gal interested in a fulfilling relationship filled with passion, intimacy, shared back rubs, a bit of kink, understanding, and whatever else fills our fancy. I don't mind going out from time to time, but all the time is not my thing. I enjoy the occasional adult beverage, am not big into weed (But not against it at all), and do smoke cigarettes (But vape most of the time these days).

If you enjoy nice quite evenings full of communication, togetherness, passion, sharing, and maybe accepting that I'm a touch lazy at home, then I beg you to respond. :)

I'm 30, single, 5'6"", average build, very giving both physically and emotionally, selfish at times, no kids, no pets at the moment (RIP :( ), and am looking for an amazing woman to spend the rest of my live with in a supportive, generous, amazing relationship.

So, if you are interested, please reply back with a bit about yourself and who you want to win the Super Bowl ;)

Who knows, maybe we can watch it together if it goes well and you're interested.

Thanks for reading. Stay warm in this cold weather :)

We are a couple, both 28, out in the Aurora area. She's getting a little sick of the usual crowd and would very much like to make some new friends to go fast with this evening. No expectations, of course. Not looking for a pnp situation but have discussed the possibility of visiting PTs or possibly Mon Chalet tonight, it really just depends. Email us with some info about you and we'd be happy to share some about us with you. 

He is about 5'8-5"" 9' and a fan of all things nerdy. Average build, shaved head, star wars obsession. She's just barely 5', around 105 lbs., and finds herself addicted to makeup and other cosmetics. Some other interests are sewing, music, and art in general. We could host or travel (if it's not too outrageously far.) We'd be happy to throw down, as far as party costs go, and were down for a variety of different things! We'd prefer to kick it with someone, or maybe even a couple, around our age but it doesn't even matter much considering this is a completly platonic request. When you reply, though, just be sure you're wanting to actually hang out tonight cause those are our intentions. :)

Just curious if there are still any married romantics out there. It's soon as that a few years have passed does the romance disappear out of the marriage. I am a romantic at heart. I love to leave little notes, write poems, surprise her with date night and lunches. Set up candle light dinners at home with the kids. But mostly what I get is unappreciative responses. I love my wife and am not looking to chance the situation. Obviously I need to adjust my version of romance. But is there any married women out there who would appreciate that kind of romance? Who likes cheesy slow jams and a back rubs? Or a rose just because. Maybe I'm an older soul. Again not looking for anything physical just more some appreciation.

I'm a gentle dom and interested in having a conversation with someone interested in exploring a submissive life style. As a gentle dom, my view is that when you adore a woman, know her needs better than she does, take control of her pleasure, and take her to places she never knew was possible, that it does something in her heart that makes her want to submit even more. If your interest in being submissive has been peaked recently and you want to explore more, I would love to talk to you. I really enjoy someone who is just learning about the lifestyle and open to some guidance from a man who adores here. I'm in strictly platonic because I don't think it has to turn into something, but I'm open to that, if it does. Write me and tell me more about your submissive desires...

Hi, we are an active couple in our early 50s living in the S Littleton area. Hoping to meet a similar couple for Christian edification, service and fellowship as we go through life together. 
With God the center of all, we could enjoy dinner parties, Bible study, a plethora of outdoor activities covering all seasons, possible roadtrips or vacations together, cultural events, volunteering etc. 
I fervently seek the Lord and want to get back into precepts studies or other in depth studies. I love my husband deeply. I think he probably attends church only because he knows its important to me.

Looking for some (already attached, preferably) for email and conversation. There is a lack of witty, intelligent and thoughtful conversation in my life right now. 

Me: more years in school than one I could afford, less common sense than I ought to possess, and more dedication to my work than it deserves. Politically a bit left of center, spiritually eclectic, and intellectually in need of some serious assistance. That's where you come in. 

Amateur chef, dangerously unskilled dirt bike rider, and passably good skier. 

You: Smart, educated either at college or school of life. Both are good. Curious about the world, lover of good food, and probably over 40 or you'll never get my music preferences. 

Will this ad result in anything? Probably not, but it's fun to try! Who knows?

Hey guys, just looking for someone who owns a hot tub that I could possibly come soak in with them tonight. I work out really hard and my muscles and lower back have just been killing me today. I figured it would be fun to find someone who has a hot tub to not only find physical relief, but also hang out and have some good conversation. If you own a hot tub and want some company for tonight, hit me up. This is a legit request and I am a cool guy. We can exchange pics beforehand and such.

Thanks!

hi my name is Mycah and my roommate Sam and I are both going to be moving to Denver Co at the end of this year or the beginning of next year.we both are single in our mid 20's men. i would like some information on what are decent areas to move to within and hour of the city. i will be transferring my job with a Marriott hotel. also would be nice to have a couple people to talk to or kinda know once we arrive out in Denver. we both are 420 friendly and like movies all about horror and comedy but will pretty much give anything a try. Come from a big drinking city or trying to cut back a little on that but love to find a good bar and food in the area big sports fans the broncos have always been my #2 team behind the Pittsburgh steelers but looks like that will be flip flopping. any information about the area and jobs are greatly appreciated and can always find each other on Instagram and Facebook to talk as well thank you!!!!

I prefer to not shit where I eat and hence would like to make some new friends outside of work and my neighborhood. I'm married and a mom and live in the south burbs. I don't smoke or do drugs and prefer friends that don't as well. I do drink socially. ..and sometimes at home solo but I don't need rehab.I am up for a good time whether it's pretending I'm 21 again, travelling, or being a sophisticated old maid. I prefer to be around those that are similiar so that we can just click. I have a pretty spunky personality but shy at first.
if u want to make a new friend let me know.

Gonna try one more time. No work today, looking anytime today or tonight. For the longest time I've been needing a female smoking buddy so here I am. Its sucks when you need to blaze, but you're alone. Figured I'd try my luck. I'm a laid back, smart ass type. Chill, confident, kind, sharing, love to listen to music when I smoke up. Mostly underground rap but down with whatever really. I'm surrounded by women that I either (professionally) can't be close to or people close in my life I cant be real with. I'm looking for a likeminded, caring, kind hearted woman that wouldn't mind getting to know a like minded guy. No expectations, and I don't need a therapist, just somebody who would like to blaze with a chill stoner like me, maybe somebody who need someone else to listen to them vent for a while too. Maybe someone who wants to be held? Or maybe just wants to get smoked up. Whatever lol.

Incase you need to know... 31, 5'8"", a stocky built 225, green eyed, short faded brown hair, bearded, non cig smoking stoner guy.

Want to know anything, or more stats/pics? Let me know what's good. Just chillin with a vape pen and some wax...

I don't mind footing the bill once in a while but I'm not a walking A.T.M. I like to have a beer and sometimes a toddy but I do not get blown away. I don't mind a person having a toke if that's to your liking -- I do. I am married and if you are, the ladies are invited to go along if we both agree. I also like to B.B.Q. in the back yard or wherever. I have nothing against gay people but I myself am not, so please don't ask for my ""stats"". Just so you know - I'm fat, ugly. old, wrinkled, toothless, bald and gots Alhemmers -- And I don't spell to good either. I do have a R.V. and a 20' deck boat to make things a little more enjoyable. Your age don't make any difference to me, as long as you can have fun and enjoy as I do.

But I'm looking for someone who can help me take pictures of myself to prove to my wife and I can be adventurous and sexy. I don't have much confidence in myself so I appreciate it if you were not judgmental. I don't find myself to be an unattractive man I just find that she is not attracted to me anymore. I'm athletic build,40 years old and work out when I can. So before this gets too long just send me a message if you're interested in helping. I don't have much money so I'm not able to pay hoping that someone can help me out of the goodness of your heart. Thank you.

I've always been a super nice guy but always end up getting the short end of the stick! Down to earth, funny, compassionate. I find the good in others. I""m very loyal and responsible. I've had to grow up fast due to my family situation. Taken on the bread winner role, and have focused on making sure my mom was taken care of. She's elderly and as a good son, I have tried to provide for her because my father left. In this world she is all I know. Not that I'm a momma's boy, but it's only right to take care of the one who has blessed me with life. Granted, it's taken a toll on my own. I've gained a few pounds and have been under stress. I don't have anyone I can honestly call a friend. I wonder if there are any other people in my situation. Having to grow up far too fast is a lonely thing. I'd like to have a sounding board to talk to from time to time. Maybe go catch a movie with from time to time . There's got to be some one out there who understands!

Hello, 27yr old white male here, actually looking for a platonic friendship with a girl. A bit about me, I find myself recently with no real friends to talk to anymoreand its starting to make me depressed. Someone I can share things with, hangout with and there be no sexual tension, play board games/video games with. I had a super close female friend like this for a little over 8 years, we lived together with a mutual friend and used to be kickass buddies but she got a new boyfriend who was extremely jealous of our friendship and felt threatened and he forced her to choose and here we are lol. 

I have my own place, career that I love, no pets but in the next 4 months have my budget planned for rescue puppy. Ideally I'd like to chat with someone over email and/or kik and if we get along well I'm open to texting and eventually meeting but if its an online only friendship I'm up for whatever works. If you like what you've read please change the subject line in your reply to your favorite color so I know you tried to read this, yes believe it or not it seems women online can be as dull and lame as men seem to be...

I am seeking help! 

I love my husband, he is attractive and romantic when he wants to be. We live in a new gorgeous house, he let me get a dog and is working hard for both of us. I live a great life but there is a big problem... I have no desire for him, sexually that is. 

Like I said I love my husband. and when we were dating I had tons of sexual desire for him. (although we only saw each other about once a month, long distance relationship.) but right before we got married its like I just... dried up? 

I can't stress this enough, I DO LOVE HIM, and its not like I am attracted to other men, I don't even get turned on watching romantic movies anymore, I don't see anyone and get turned on anymore. I just don't get turned on anymore at all. 

He blames himself, thinks that he is not in good enough shape or if he was just more romantic or etc... and that's not it. He is very attractive, and IS VERY romantic. I feel like I lied to him. I feel like my body betrayed me. 

And he is getting more exasperated... sex is a need for men and I am not meeting this need for him. I am worried that he may soon try to find the attention that I am not giving to him somewhere else and that thought is killing me. 

Then again maybe I should let it happen... I don't know, If I did that I couldn't take the thought of him finding satisfaction somewhere else other than in me. 

I do try to give him sex when I can, but it is only like once or maybe twice a month. I don't know what is wrong with me... someone please give me advice.

Well as the title suggests, just looking for some new friends to text with our email. Works been slowing down and it's always nice meeting new people to chat with as it makes the day more enjoyable.

A bit about me, I am 36 and currently single. I work quite a bit so always running around. I have a wide array of interests and like to try most things at least twice (you never know after just one time). I love my Broncos and am so excited for Sunday to get here. :) 

I am not all that sure if I am looking to meet in person just yet. So mostly just chatting for now. If interested, send me an email!

OK, so I have a really hard time meeting women. I don't know what it is. I think I have a good sense of humor and am not too hideous looking. I have probably far too much education and have a super interesting career. However, I'm not 6 feet tall (I'm 5'7"") and I don't have a full head of hair and maybe I don't smile as much as I should so maybe those are three strikes and I'm out. Whatever. I do have female friends that I rock climb and ski with. I thought I'd post here to see if there are any women out there, maybe even married women, who would just like a male friend to talk with, maybe see movies with (I'm a big science fiction and fantasy fan). If things were to evolve into something more then, cool. However, as the Rolling Stones sang- you can't always get what you want, but sometimes you can get what you need.

Hi there! I'm looking for a girl who would like to chat via email with my friend and I. We chat quite often through the week about everything, no subject is off limits.

We would love to hear from you. :)

So... lets get to it? 

I just went through a break up and I'm feeling all sorts of.. all over. I'm hurt, but will get better, and honestly kind of lonely.

It's something I've never had to handle on this scale before. I thought we could get married, and then.. nope. It's a very everything kind of feeling. Honestly, it was probably going to be this way, I had hope and thought people worked together and made love work. She thinks that means she dictates EVERYTHING and if that doesn't work, screaming and flipping out and making irrational decisions will. And it doesn't. And I'm done. Thankfully. A little relieved. 


Anyway, a few of my friends are now harassing me daily, to talk to girls. 

**at anyplace with any female that looks our direction- friends speaking** ""please talk to him, at this point he needs any positive interaction with a female because he just escaped a succubus, and he needs to get some of his soul back"" -- real thing said, several times. .. Please kill me now, if you're merciful dear 8lbs 6 oz new born baby Jesus! 

So that's my circle, and that's mostly me. A positive, glass half full kind of goof. I'm with it, down to earth, try to be funny when I can, and just moving on day to day at the moment. 


What I'm looking for? Whatever at this point. I'm not sure I can handle a relationship, I'm not sure I can handle friends with benefits. I'm not sure I could even do a 'fling'. well..... that last part is most likely a lie, I'm still a guy. I'm down, not dead. I'm not trying to wiggle at everything that moves though. 

I know I want something more than just a therapist to listen to me be sad. I want to flirt and have conversations. Maybe grab a beer, a sandwich, some wings, movie if you need someone so you don't go alone. I don't do horror movies though, not gonna happen. Even if you pout and beg and try to make little innocent but devious faces. I'm not going. lol 

I guess friends are right, I'm not broken, and this really f*cking hurts.. I could definitely use positive female interaction. 


If you're interested, let me know. Be with it, normal, working, paying bills, etc. I don't want crazy. I'm not a feather, I'm not a 300lbs slob either, no offense. Just fall somewhere normal is all I'm asking. 

Kind of long, thanks for sticking it out. - Drew

So here's the deal. I am a relatively normal guy with a good life. However, I've moved around a few times, and in the last several locations, I've been at the top of the organization I work for. Because, perhaps, I am old-fashioned, I don't build real friendships with employees, so it has been hard to find real, true, friends outside of home and work. This leaves a bit of a gaping hole in my life, and I'm trying everything I can to fill the gap.

I tend to build better friendships with women, and always have. So here I am, somewhat embarrassingly, posting on Craigslist. This is not a veiled attempt at finding a lover. I'm a happily married guy with the coolest kids on the planet and am really seeking a platonic friend.

I'm in my mid to late forties (see what I did there), politically progressive, well-read, educated, interested in just about everything you're not supposed to talk about: Politics, religion, science, literature, movies, music, etc. . . I like to stay in shape, and was in the service a million years ago.

I'd like to meet someone who likes to talk about Life, the Universe, and Everything: What you fear, what brings you joy, what makes you smile, and what makes you cry, how do you deal with it, how can you make it better.

If we were to hit it off on email, I'd love to have coffee, lunch, a finely hand-crafted microbrew, or a classic cocktail, and get to know each other better.

If you are not interested, and just feeling generous with your time -- I'd love to hear your thoughts on how to meet friends outside of work and home -- especially if you are not single, and aren't looking for a hookup.

Thanks for your time. My fingers are crossed.

Good morning/afternoon/evening!

My name is Jesse Puga and I own Puga Athletics and Fitness. I currently train about 19 to 23 clients and/or athletes at any given time. I would like to continue increasing my base clientele. 

I am willing to offer discounts in an effort to appeal to clients who can workout during daytime hours (8:00am to 6:30pm). My normal rate is $40 for a general session and $60 for specialist coaching. However, I am willing to take on new clients during these off-peak hours at just $20 - $30 per training session, with FURTHER DISCOUNTS available the longer you train.

Now, no where out there can you join a gym and receive high-level personal training and skill coaching for anywhere near this price, and these will be low stress, one-on-one sessions unless you would like to bring a friend to workout with.

Are you: Into intimacy, both physical and emotional? ... If it even gets that far?

Are you: Still reading?

If you are moderately attractive (or better), you're confident about yourself, and you're not looking for too much, I'm here. Friendship is best, but I'm feeling a bit flaky and very vulnerable. I only care about your looks because in my current state of vulnerability, at least if you take advantage of that and decide to get in my pants, I will feel a little better about it.

Yes the headline pretty much sums it up. If we could be great workout buddies, beer drinking friends and dinner companions, pretty sure everything else would work itself out to our advantage. True!?
I love great beer, IPA's being my fav, really BIG IPA's. Dinner-wise flexible. I am a damn good cook, but also love going out sushi (Den), awesome salads, cooked seafood and red meat! Workouts? No time for amateurs, I go hard lift heavy sh*t, Crossfit and am a supportive, knowledgeable workout partner.
So to summarize if you happen to love working out (and it shows), enjoy great food, beer and like easy-going attractive guys, maybe we should see what happens?
If you are married, I am not the man for you.

I'm looking for someone to write old fashioned love letters to. I have what seems like an infinite supply of words to say to a distant beautiful woman I've never seen. A woman who loves wine, and coffee, and music, and rich colors and gorgeous views. Someone who reads real books with pages. Someone who cries in movies, appreciates history, takes chances and closes her eyes when something wonderful happens, to keep it from evaporating. She's had to have been through some tragedy and pain, so that she knows what joy and rapture are. Someone who trusts happiness, loves naps and knows that in the center of everything is a good place. I have a great life. I'm successful and healthy, I'm a kind, funny person, devoted father, etc. But there is a starving part of me that can only be fulfilled by having a person in my life to whom I can start emails with ""I thought of you many times today..."" -- but who I will probably never actually meet.

I am a straight guy who is not looking for sex. But I have noticed that I sometimes feel humbled in the presence of blond guys who are short and athletic. Think gymnast, rugby player, or lightweight wrestler. I am 5-9, 160, mostly Italian, hairy athletic guy. If you are 5-9 or shorter, less than 160 lbs, athletic, and blond -- and you like the idea of comparing bodies to see who is manlier -- contact me with your complete stats, age, and location. Again, I am not looking for sex, but I want to figure out why I feel humbled by guys like I have described. I am curious to see if I compare bodies with a guy like that up close, rather than at a distance, I will feel superior or inferior. If you have this kind of curiosity, write. I will want to chat before arranging any meeting. Very sensible professional guy here, and you should be too. You also must be age 40 or younger, in addition to 5-9 or shorter.

Are you: A smoker/vaper or at least cool with a guy that is?

Are you: Into intimacy, both physical and emotional? ... If it even gets that far?

Are you: Still reading?

Are you: 23-35, and interested in chatting to see if we mesh?

I am: 30, white, have a job, my own place, car, and interested in meeting a great lady.No kids. No pets at the moment (Still getting over my cats passing). 5'5"" average... and sometimes needy, but always cool with independence :)

Write me back :) The worst that could happen is that we have a conversation, realize it won't work and move on... But I'm betting we can have a good chat.

Hello all,

I have a work function tomorrow night and I'm dreading going alone. 

It's an employee appreciation night and I'm sick of my co-workers telling me how wonderful of a man I am and how they're so confused as to why I'm single.

I'm looking for someone to come along to the event with me. If you're willing to pretend it's a date, that might be even better, but really I don't care about that. I'm just looking for someone to accompany me to shut my co-workers up so I can relax and have fun.

My work is providing dinner, and I will buy drinks. The event is from 7 pm to 11 pm.

If you would like to meet me there, that's fine, and if you live in Lakewood, I can also pick you up.

Drop me a message if you're interested. Please include a picture and a little about yourself.

Thanks!

As sad as it is, we have learned that good people are hard to find! With that said, we are hoping to find anyone who is hoping to find new people to hangout and have fun with. We love to watch movies (especially horror), have drinks, smoke 420, go to dancing, go bar hoping, bowling, shopping, watch sports, we are big foodies and love to cook, love to be in the outdoors, camping, shooting, hiking and all sorts of normal shit! He loves to snowboard, has a epic pass and is teaching me how. At this point, we are so content with each other, that we are open to just about anything and anyone at this point.

I'm putting together a new social nudist group in Denver for younger nudists or guys who might be interested. 

I'm 31, white active and fit. I've been a nudist for 10 years. I love the bonding and brotherhood aspect. Our group is focused on young men under 45. 

I've formed a group on meetup called Denver young men's nudist brotherhood. Look it up on there or shoot me an email. 

The group is all about naked parties, game nights, drinking watching a game or whatever. Just laid back activities at a private home where we just chill naked. Open to all sexualities since it's not a sex group. But tantric massage or edging could be possibilities for gatherings. Cool with 420. 

Our next meetup is Sunday for a Super Bowl Party in the buff. 

So if you're a nudist, naturalist, exhibitionist or wanted to try it but couldn't find dudes your age this group is for you.

Hey everyone, so here's the deal. I'm depressed and sad won't lie from a recently ended relationship. So I just want to stop being down at least for a while. I'm intelligent, I'd like to think handsome/good looking. I'm a talker and a gentleman. I'd like to hear from someone like that. Oh and it's Saturday! :-)

I'm always up for going out, going to happy hours, going to movies, having movie and wine nights, boozy brunches, trying different workout classes, and I would love to make it up to the mountains at some point this winter and definitely during the spring and summer.

Who wants to make new friends! Whatever the reason? Old friends flakes? Old friends moochers? Old friends moved away, got married, had kids and forgot you are still here and alive? Lol
Well we are a married couple with no drama asking for other couples to come over drink and play games. No pics needed cause friends don't need to be perfect but in our home just be clean and respectful! Let's play some games and drink some drinks!! BYOB

Our situation is one friend moved out of state
One couple friends say the 35 minute drive is to far so it's hard to come over 
One couple friends had a kid and all they ever do is eat out anyways
Another couple friends they r always to busy for us
So here we find ourself looking for friends! Long term friends. We don't care if you are black, white or brown or even green! We don't care if you are skinny or fat! We don't care if you are bi, straight or whatever else there is lol How ever we do care if you are honest and respectful. 

We like tent camping, sight seeing, dive bars, pool, guns, concerts, dancing, our hot tub, the man cave, game nights, free days around Denver, concerts in the park and so much more! 

Thanks for reading and hope to meet soon!

Hi! Thanks for taking the time to read me! I'm searching for new female friends who are gay friendly and live in and around the southern metro area. I am not certain that there is going to be a Princess Charming in my future, so building friendships is more important than ever. 

For fun I enjoy watching the Bronco's, all sorts of arts and crafts, camping, fishing, board games, watching movies, trying new places to eat, the occasional sporting event, and an occasional outing to the local gay club. 

I'm looking for someone with similar interests who has time to hang out. I'm not looking for someone to date so it doesn't matter whether you are single or partnered. I miss having another close friend to hang out with and talk about the everyday stuff. If you think that we might get along it would be great to hear from you.

I'll get the drinks for the night in trade for a picture or two. Hence keeping my family and friends off my back for a bit. 

If you are interested please send a picture and include your drink of choice as your subject. Have a nice night

So hey. I'm looking for some serious friends!

I've got an amazing partner and a solid job and I'm working a lot on myself, growing and changing and trying new things, but I need someone (or a few someones?) to share it with!

*29 years old
*In an open relationship
*Queer
*Non-binary (neutral pronouns, please!)
*Introvert, and a goof once you get to know me
*Pun lover, cat person, professional cuddler, general nerd
*Currently developing interests, teach me something! Or even better, let's learn something together!

Are you new to town or even just not as well connected as you'd like to be? Sick of scams or getting the run around? Do you like to party? And maybe even get into a little mischief? Well, if that's the case then you and I likely have some common interests...

Im known to be quite helpful, in a number of ways, and I'm always down to make new friends around the Aurora area. Im usually pretty open as far as my schedule goes,I'm upfront and honest, plus you'll never catch me on any of the bs I'm finding out is all over this city. 

Mainly I like to either nod out with the boy, here in Aurora; but sometimes my friend Crystal hits me up and we get to spinning around really fast. Either one of those friends are really good people and very easy to deal with. Occasionally I run into some other folks I know, as well. It just depends on the day.

Anyways, I'm up and about hoping to meet some new friends. If you're interested in anything I wrote here, you're totally welcome to hit me up thru email and tell me more about yourself, along with more about what kind of friend you're looking for and what you're expectations are. The more details you include, the more likely you are to get a fast and complete reply. 

I'm not looking for dates, pic swaps, or any kind of pnp situation. Platonic friends only. Must be down to party!!

Looking for guy friends. Lived in Denver for years and have had the hardest time making guy friends other than at work. Would be fun to meet someone that occasionally likes to go out for drinks or go to breweries after work or on the weekends. I snowboard though I'm not very good but I have a good time. I do like video games just don't play much. I also like watching movies and going to them. Hiking and camping are also cool. Age doesn't really matter but prefer your at least 21 and older but of course closer in age is always good. Hit me up and we can get to know each other. Put FRIENDS in the Subject line so I know your real.

Please read the whole ad:

Hi! I just moved to S. Denver a month ago and am wondering if there are any cool, stable and intelligent beings who just enjoy meeting new people? I'm open to anything winter related (skiing, hiking, tubing), going out to movies, road trips, sports, and food. Haha I'm a health nut and love cooking and working out and running so a workout partner is wanted as well. . I'm 420 friendly and always find that to be a good ice breaker seeing as I DONT drink or smoke cigarettes.. I can't host but would be down to meet up somewhere or come to you if you're within a good distance. I'm not looking for romance of any kind. I am in my early twenties, single, no kids or crazy exes and employed. This is a real ad and I'm genuine. Hope you are too. Love watching movies and tv and just smoking a bowl or going for a trail run or a new healthy or super yummy place to eat. 

Someone in their twenties to early thirties is preferred and no one married. Please send some interesting things about you and not just one word or one sentence. :) I'm looking more to hang out than write emails. Again, please tell me about you. I've said a lot about me. And if we are to meet, a face picture would be lovely. I'm not going to keep it and I can send one back. Please don't try otherwise

I should have been born female. If I were to have been born female I could enjoy men all I want without the stigma of, well you know..... 
But I wasn't and I do enjoy them anyway. I always like to please. I love being submissive and being seduced (not a hard thing to do by the way.) If you are male, older than 55 but younger than 68, enjoy being the one in charge and don't mind it if I am a little high, we should get together. I am looking for a man that can talk intelligently on any number of subjects and is not over weight. Having a large cock is a definite plus. please get back too me

I'm looking for a running buddy! Ideally I would love to start a couch to 10k program but would be super flexible in that distance. 

I used to run a lot but have fallen away from the sport in the last six months or so ... So if you're new or an experienced runner, let's chat :)

Hi! I'm looking to provide you with a relaxing massage. I offer several different types of massages to help you release built up stress, tension and stubborn day to day body aches and pain. I love pampering women, and have been told that I am very good at it. My time is flexible and I can usually work around your schedule, and we will individualize each session to fit your needs.

My rates are well below most others and I do outcall appointments, so you won't have to drive! Right now I am offering the first 3 women to set an appointment a FREE massage! I'm completely mobile, table, linens, candles, warm oil and soothing music. My house is in the midst of remodeling, so I don't have a home studio right now. I have lived in Douglas County for 20+ years, all at the same address in the Lone Tree/Highlands Ranch area. I am a white male, 52 years old, hwp/fit, blues eyes, blond/gray hair, 5'11"" and 185lbs. Please change the subject line to the name of the city you live in. It's unfortunate I have to ask for that, but there are a lot of bot's and spam out there. I will provide a pic, just not on here. I am passionate about what I do and look forward to talking soon! Thanks for reading!!

Hi everyone!

Ive tried posting here before but I'm open to trying again. I'm outgoing, wild and very crazy. I'm also super loyal, honest, genuine, and real. I'm very open and inclusive. I love to be weird: to dance and sing in public, laugh at jokes that aren't funny, and try new things. I'm pansexual and super open minded. I currently babysit for multiple families and I love taking care of kids. 

I love to go hiking and camping. I'm a big fan of bowling and miniature golf. I read more than anyone I've ever met (anything from romance to fantasy to teen fiction.) I'm a gamer girl and play games frequently. I love all types of music, though when listening to the radio I usually only listen to 106.7 or 98.5 :) My absolute favorite when it comes to music is Indigo Girls. I've been obsessed for years. I haven't bought their new album yet but I definitely want to!! I like watching TV, but there are way too many shows I like to narrow it down for you. I'm always down to try new things and have new experiences. 

I don't do any drugs and I recently quit smoking. I occasionally like going out to bars/clubs but would rather go salsa dancing or bowling.

I've gained a lot of weight lately (health issues) and would love some help/motivation to get out of the house. Ideally I would go for a run/walk/jog in the afternoons/evenings and maybe even do some yoga or martial arts. If I could find someone willing to put in the effort I'm positive we would start seeing results. :) 

I'm hoping to meet people near me who are also wild and crazy. Who don't do drugs, and are open and friendly. Those with sarcastic humor and who live near me a plus. I want someone who wants to do stuff, but is also okay with just coming over and hanging out. I don't always feel like driving to see people and sometimes wish people would come to me. Hope to hear from you!! I'm not trying to sleep with you, so I have no preference on race, height/weight, sexual orientation, gender, age or anything like that. 

Please put ""New Friend"" in the subject line so I can weed out the people who actually read my post, from the scammers. I'm more likely to respond if you tell me about yourself and maybe say why you think we would be good friends. If you include your phone number we can text, since that's much easier for me and I'll respond much faster.

Or ... how about loose cigarettes ? (4 for a nickel) Phone calls weren't the only thing that cost a nickel.

And then there was Frankie Lane down at the Paramount - always gave us a good reason to cut out of school ...

I am told I am a good looking and confident man. I know I am a good listener and desperate to share my feelings with an equally good listener. I really want an open discussion and from the heart.

Hi!

I had another ad up but something happened to it. Anyway, I am looking to make some real friends, hopefully ones that want to hang out with me and do things. I have been in Denver over a year now, and have had zero luck in making friends, and zero luck in romance. I also have no family here, so you can imagine in such a big place it can get pretty lonely.

How does this happen? Sigh, I don't know. A lifetime of moving around with my Father being military, and I was too. Being a little shy and introverted....dozens of factors I guess. But being single, without family, and without friends is not a natural state for a human being to be in! Especially a kind one such as my self. I plan to place this ad in the male section as well eventually, but I do find I tend to get along better with females.

Id like to meet some people my age range 36-45, that keep in shape and want to help me get in shape, like movies, exploring, perhaps some hiking ""as I would like to get into that"" and open to other things. I don't smoke, and I don't hunt animals. Here is a list of some of my interests, I have also attached a photo.

Please no scams, I need to find some connection to Colorado.

Music, Animals, Movies, Volunteering, Biking, Hiking, Exploration, Road trips, Tattoos, Motorcycles, Shooting, Drums, Martial Arts, Flying, Learning, Computers, Games, Red box , Exploring , Mountains, Oceans, Autumn, Sunsets, Meditation, Science, Holding hands, Being in love, Communication, Conversation, Art, Web design, Museums, Dog parks, and much more!

Please be within the age range so we have shared experiences and hopefully things in common, your interests, maybe a photo since I have one, and what part of Denver you live in. Sometimes things go to spam and I miss them, other than that if I don't reply then I felt we probably didn't share a lot in common.

Thanks for reading my long ad.

Name is Chris. I just moved to Colorado a little over a month ago for work. I haven't had the chance to get out and explore the state, and I haven't met any cool people yet so I'm hoping to find a friend here to show me around!

I like videogame, but I wouldn't say I'm a ""gamer"" because I'm more into the older stuff like Nintendo... ok, i guess you can say im a little nerdy but i dont look nerdy-- Does that make sense?

If you only knew how often you cross my mind, consuming my thoughts. I miss you even though I've never had you. Throughout my life I have been lucky enough to experience love and I have also learnt what it feels like to go without. The dull ache from loneliness courses through my body. The tears have spilt out of my eyes landing on my pillow because sometimes it's too much to take. I know exactly how much I have to give to you. Craving so desperately your gentle embrace, just tight enough that I won't slip away but light enough to give me the room I need to breath. Wanting to drink you in and escape into you. I often sit alone at my table eating the food I've prepared looking at your empty spot, wishing for your companionship. Those easy going conversations and comfortable silences. Have I had you, only for you to slip away? Are you searching for me right now? 
I've looked for you time and time again always coming up short. Where will we find each other? Online? Will we see each other somewhere and recognize a safe place in one another's eyes? Oh my sweet, dear friend, my lover come to me. Let my words awaken you. I wait for you as patiently as I can possibly bear.

It's fine with me if you're married or single, young or old, just be Asian and be willing to share a beautiful friendship...talking, getting to know each other, sharing stories, sharing struggles, sharing dreams, laughing together, being playful, and building a beautiful connection. My best friend in California was an Asian woman who was struggling in her marriage to an Asian man and confided in me. It was platonic but wonderful for both of us, so married is ok. I hope you're out there somewhere, send me a note and tell me more about you.

Are you struggling in your relationship or wish you had a better sex life?

I am a professional, divorced, positive-thinking, compassionate and understanding man.
I'm in my 40's and I have experienced the ups & downs of a long-term marriage, the trials & tribulations of divorce, as well as, the joys and stress of raising children. I understand the ""silent home"", ""living like roommates"", ""walking on eggshells"", ""sleeping in separate rooms"", ""feeling unwanted"", etc.

Throughout the years, I have repeatedly been told that I should be a therapist. I believe that I do have a natural ability to listen, understand and provide positive, constructive feedback to those who are struggling. In particular, I have a strong interest in helping people overcome relationship & sexual issues. My life experiences, combined with my genuine and sincere interest in this area, allows me to do so.

I have a sincere interest in helping people who are experiencing relationship & sexual issues. I know that professional therapy is expensive. I know that many are too shy to seek therapy, as well.

I can offer you free, non-judgemental, sincere advice. I can offer you someone to share your concerns about your relationship or sexual issues, in an anonymous way. Please reach out to me, if you need someone that is a good listener and genuinely interested in helping you.

maybe you have done something with

Or
played with abnormal objects or even

thing
that happen but i dont judge or criticize.

are wilder than others. ;-) ill start with oneof
mine. One day about sunset was driving
with an
ex gf and from previous touching and
groping,
we got hot so were heading to get a room. On
the way there, she went down on me while i
drove. Couldnt wait any longer so i pulled
over
on side of highway went to passenger side,
bend her on the seat and went at it with both
doors open. Was a thrill.. Dont be shy. Hope

I'm 29 I have a good job and I'm looking to have a good time. If you wanted to hang out outside of dancing and then that would be fine too. 

I'm really really trying to find someone and have not had any luck so if there's anybody out there who wants to either learn how to salsa and has never done it before and wants to try or someone who is pretty good and is looking for someone to go with.

I just thought I'd try this idea out. I know there are gonna be some ""asshole-like"" responses, but I suppose that comes with the territory...

I'm just a simple dude who has had bad luck in my pursuit of a soulmate. I just thought there was perhaps a fella here who has a sister, female cousin, good friend or co-worker he knows of who perhaps has had bad luck of her own, finding a man to make her happy. Think you may be able to perhaps hook us up with eachother?

I know. I know. You don't know me. As I do understand no one knows others on Craigslist, I figured the best I could do is give as thorough a description of myself as possible. 

ME:

40, very handsome(often told-not boastful), Middle-class male. Independent. I'm not rich, but well enough to live alone. I have a car. I love my career. I'm a singer in two bands. 

I'm not a player. I don't do games, whatsoever. I'm very 20th century. I'm simple. I've never been married and I have no children. Definitely Funny. I work full time, I'm in two bands and yet I still have plenty of time to spare for a relationship. 

I just want one. One woman/best friend/2nd half. I'm African American.

I've never cheated(no bullshit). Completely loyal, chivalrous, minimalist. Independent & responsible. I have no roommates. Somewhat introverted. Looking for something that could possibly lead to an aisle to a march down, if you know what I mean. 

What I'd like? 
Just a pretty, simple, loyal & kind, open-minded woman. I's rather a woman who is not a BBW, as I myself work to stay fit/healthy. No baby's father issues would be great too. I have not one racist bone in my anatomy, so ethnic background means nothing to me. I'd prefer a woman with no kids, as is the case with me, but I'm open minded. If she were the somewhat introverted type as well, I'd really like that. 


I understand how you fellas come to Craigslist seeking as well. Maybe you have a relative or something.

I'm 100% sure that if her intentions were honest as mine are, she'll thank you for life for introducing her to me. No a boastful statement. I just know for sure what I need in life and who I am is all. 


It's not a crime to try this route, so what the heck, right?

If you did know of someone, it would me a lot to hear from you. 

There it is. Just thought, once again, I'd give this a try. Maybe there's someone out there sympathetic who has a good heart with good intentions. 

Thanks for reading my post.

Alright men, I'm looking for some new friends. I'm a gay male. Just started going to the gym all the time with a personal trainer and would be awesome to find some good buds to meet up and hit the gym. I work full time, I enjoy photography and basically all music. I'm not a bar rat and I'm trying to stay away from drinking so some good friends who don't want to get wasted all the time would be ideal!

Me: I'm 27, since I do work full time and try to get to bed at a good time I don't have much time to go out and meet new people so I'm turning to this. I'm gay so if that's an issue please go to the next listing! I'm a fun loving guy with no filter. I flirt and have fun but you need to know that if you can't have fun then there is no point to talking to me. So send me a message, send me a pic please and your first name! Like I said again I do have a job so if I don't get back to you ASAP please give me some time to respond! Looking forward to meeting some awesome new people!

Happy new year to everyone!!! I hope the year is off to a great start!!! For me it hasn't been great, I moved here and left a lot of my friends back in Arizona. My old bff especially was amazing!!! She loved shopping, and teaching me how to be one of the girls. I'd love to find a fun girl to be friends with that would enjoy having a gay friend like me around. Please put ""Broncos"" in the subject to weed out the spam and hope to hear from some fun open minded friends.

Looking for a platonic friend. Mostly into girls but I am discrete with guys. Would like to find a friend that is intelligent, travelled, likes to game, likes to bull shit about things like spirituality, religion, politics, astronomy... MUST be mature, responsible, witty... something to offer. I don't spend my time with just anyone.. I know.. then why the fuck am I here... well you never know where you might find that diamond in the rough. I'm into reading, writing, history, mountain biking, climbing, boxing, spirituality/religion, politics, traveling, philosophy, gaming, anything sexual (human sexuality, relationships, ways of being.. etc)... so if any of this interests you, shoot me a message. Tell me a little about you. What sparked your interest. You don't have to be attractive and fit BUT I relate more to people that are at least active and trying to take care of themselves. I'M IN a relationship.. hence platonic.. images below are not mine.. BUT give you a visual of things that interest me.

I've got an interesting proposition for someone who's open minded. I am currently in a relationship, and while I'm very happy in it, I can't stop thinking about other girls.

I was hoping to find an extra special female, who would love to hang out, do fun things, share some forms of intimacy (cuddling, flirting, etc) but without all the sexual aspects.

I don't condone cheating, but really yearn for another person to become close with (without it being considered cheating).

Is this post most likely going to be ignored? Probably. But maybe there is someone in a similar situation that might find this to be interesting.

420 is a must :)

Hi there.

I am bored and want to talk to someone. Let's talk about secrets. Tell me something you have been dying to try (sexual or not) but haven't told anyone. I will do the same.

I've actually had really good luck making friends off Craigslist, so I'm here to expand my circle. 

Not at all looking to spend useless hours talking online. You either click or you don't, and that's something that is generally determined in person :)

I'm a casual purveyor of craft beer or a glass of wine, delighted by all things coffee. I love swing dancing (wanna learn? I can be lead or follow to teach), and find the mountains stunning (although I paint them more than sleep in them). Oh, and I'm a traveler, so conversation is fairly easy to run with.

At the surface, think we'll get along? Brilliant. Shoot me a message, we'll go from there!

Hi Guys. I am an amateur photographer and love taking photos. Need some updated photos for online, personal use or whatever? Can take whatever you wish, and not easily embarrassed. I can also take pictures of you and your boyfriend. Or surprise photos for his birthday or special occasion. I am an easy going, midwestern laid back guy.

So let's discuss your needs. I do not have a studio, so will have to be at the place of your choosing. I can also do videos if you want them.... I have a very good eye and am creative - everything from general, to sensual, to erotic, to suggestive. And everything in between. Photos are entirely for your use, and I do not retain any of them. TOTALLY DISCRETE AND PRIVATE.

I'm looking for other professionals, massage students, or enthusiasts wishing to do a massage trade. Also if you are a first timer, never had massage, maybe shy about receiving massage, I'm the one for you. Safe, non-sexual but sensual, touch experience. 12 yrs prof exp. Owned my own clinic/school for 6 yrs. 

Touch therapy heals the body and spirit. reduces stress and muscle soreness, speeds recovery from work and working out, etc. etc. I'm happy to get into the physiology of how massage effects the body, but not here. 

I can't host but I can come to you (with or without table). Bringing my table is better. Also open to forming massage groups (the more the merrier) or teaching couples how to work on each other, Just don't have the space for it myself. 

If you are just looking for a happy ending and a free massage, please look elsewhere. I'm looking for guys genuinely interested. Doesn't matter what label you wear, str8, bi, gay. etc. We all need human touch.

I'm fairly new to the area and in search for friendship with a like minded lady + or - 10 yrs my age (34). I work out regularly at a local gym early mornings and have an extensive knowledge on nutrition, exercise techniques/ routines. So even if you are wanting to get in better shape or starting out I can help there too! 

I live a healthy lifestyle but not a total health nut, I enjoy a cold drink now and then and a good cheat meal (: life is too short not too, right?! 
I also love the outdoors and can't get enough of this awesome Colorado weather!

I am attached and not looking to change anyone's situation or create drama. This may sound odd but I prefer a woman's friendship compared to a man's anymore. I'm an open book and honest man that loves to talk, so feel free to say hi!

Or are you curious about this spirit of the soul, the vine of life? To be quite honest I have only experienced Aya, one time, but that was enough to confirm that there is and are other dimensions, and other spirits out there, who are here to help us evolve as individuals, and as a society. I experienced it for the first time, and only time in Costa Rica, almost a year ago to this date. I am sitting here listening to a web cast of Joe Rogan and Graham Hancock right this moment,(an amazing talk by the way) hence the inspiration to reach out on this medium to others that might have experienced it. 

My experience was incredible, in so many cosmic ways, I am not going to get into all the juicy details here, but let me say that I felt like I was one with the jungle, and the leaves, and the vines, and animals and spirits, like I never was before or since. I miss that feeling, that connection, and I would like to find someone who is at least open to experiencing this incredible plant spirit together some day...

Me? I am a writer, a published writer who has written two, sci fi, spiritual-fantasy, novels. Ironically most of the content of my novels takes place down in Costa Rica, which is where I spent a year of my life recently. I miss Costa, I miss the rugged invigorating beautify of her jungles, and oceans and rivers and waterfall. I crave a sensual soul, who I could get lost with in the jungle of love, of passion of nature, together with, I dream of her on a daily basis. 

I dream of frolicking naked under tropical waterfalls, or paddling, on a beautiful river, or on a desolate bay, or in the cave behind my very own special waterfall. I dream of sharing this deeper, divine connection with that special someone, every single day of my life, and I have a feeling that someday soon, we will unite. I have written about here extensive in my novels she is my Ying and I am her Yang. I am the strong masculine, alpha, and she is the divine, sensual, goddess, and together we make magic. We balance each other perfectly, much like the balance that can be found on the Sea Saw of life, if we are fortunate enough to find that bliss. I know I deserve it, I crave it... do you?

I am ready to humble myself, to be the man I was always meant to be, to cherish her, and love her, and to reach a deeper level of consciousness then I have ever experienced. I really do believe that together, anything is possible, anything is achievable, I can help you to see things, to experience things you have only ever imagined.... will you help me to see the things I want to see and feel? I hope you will....

First...... if your a pro keep looking. Not interested!!!!

Now, for any real ladies looking to meet for dinner and a drink, here goes. I am looking for a lady to have a nice conversation over dinner. I would love to hear about your job, your kids, your husband........whatever. Just be interesting. 
I am in Colorado every month or so and I do not like to eat alone. I am married, have kids, a fantastic job, a stable mental status and have not been in handcuffs in (ohh so many) years. If your thinking this guy is crazy, I am, but I know it and that's 90% of the problem today. People think they are normal when they are total fruitloops. I can hold a conversation with a CEO or a homeless Vet ( and we should ALL have a conversation and help out our Vets, homeless or not ) and have that conversation really mean something. I am an interesting mix of Italian and just a touch of Polish, but the Italian really shows. 
Faults: Im overweight, bald, and have a hard time seeing the Bad Things in anyone (until they prove they are no good) but my character really outweighs any visual flaws. 
If your still reading this I think you are getting a sense of, perhaps he is not so crazy....... your intuition is working well. 
Ok, so why post here? He's looking for sex. 
Well, here comes the Italian showing!!!! Fugettabout it........ I am not trying to sleep with you, or any other form of naked recreational activity. I am an extremely clean, safe, almost to the point of germ-a-phobe type of guy so the thought of body fluids and disease transmission just....... well enough, Just not interested in sexing you up (or whatever they call it today) 
Want to sit and drink a 20 year old scotch and see how the flavors tease our tongues, now your talking..... flirt with me, tease, sure, I am a big tease myself. Want to laugh, cry or just unwind to a stranger (who is now your new friend) then I think you might have just found something worth putting together a nice email for. 
Next thought going thru your head (lets see if I'm good) This guy must be an Ogre, you know, Shrek looking. Why is he doing this, hideous looking man..... Well I am not hard to look at, but definitely not ""easy on the eyes"" pretty boy material. I am more the Tony Soprano looking type. Italian comes out again..... If you were out with the girls I would not be the first guy you approached in the bar, nor would I be the last. I fall somewhere in the middle. Talk with me and you'll be sorry you wasted those 12 mins of your life talking to Bernard, the ""Hedge Fund Manager"" that was wearing a $2,700 suit but wouldn't know how to put together an IKEA desk, let alone the IKEA bed he was trying desperately to get you into. 
OK, enough of the rant...... here is the plan. Lets discuss dinner, anything but Italian, unless you really, really want it. Send me a recent, real photo of you. Please don't be a Drop Dead Gorgeous Supermodel (all those things about not sexing you up and body fluids all become null and void) Please be a real and caring person. Married, Single, Widowed, Divorced....... I am not here to judge. Just be a nice person. I am here this weekend and back the end of the month also. I have a car, can pick you up, or meet you at the restaurant. (pick the meet me at the restaurant, If you'd get into a car with me after this post without meeting in public..... Im not sure I want to have dinner with you, your crazy) 
I have put some time into this, please do the same. Tell me a bit about yourself, your situation, your likes, dislikes...... I love Purple. Have you ever been arrested, and was it just a misunderstanding? You know, engage me somewhat. Make me feel good about buying you dinner at WaffleHouse. 
I really look forward to hearing from you.

Hey what's up? I'm just your average 22-year-old weirdo, new to Denver. moved here from the San Francisco Bay. 

Haven't made any friends and got used to being alone. . . (aside from my boyfriend)

Who wants to pick me up? Let's get coffee and/or food, go thrifting or get some art supplies and come back here to create stuff. I'll buy lunch since you'll be doing the driving. Deal?

I have plenty of good friends in my life but not too many gay friends. Yeah, its great hanging out with my straight friends but it would be nice to find other guys like myself who have the same interest when it comes to the same sex. No offense but not really looking for feminine guys. I live a pretty discrete life so it just fits. The crowd I hang out with doesn't provide an opportunity to meet other gay guys like myself or that I would ever really hang out with so that's a bit of the dilemma. I am not looking for sex....particularly. Mainly looking for other laid back drama-free masculine gay guys who are fun to hang with....if other things happen then they happen but I am NOT looking to get laid here as top priority.

I am down to hang out, grab a beer, kick back, play some playstation/x-box, grab a movie, food, hike, gym, theater, art shows, travel, etc....love trying out new stuff.

I'm a good-looking guy
masculine/discrete
fit
non-smoker

If any of this sounds good then by all means feel free to drop me a line with stats and pic and ill return mine....I'm mostly looking for other guys around my age with the same interests so just keep that in mind.

Hi,

Thanks for taking the time to read my post. For some time now, it's been clear my circle of friends has grown smaller, and those I do have are shifting. I am feeling less connected than many years ago when we began our friendship. Though they are dear to me, I am finding myself longing for a connection with another who values not only intellect, attending to physical body's needs (e.g. exercise, sustenance) but also has a desire to be better than he is today. I am seeking someone who finds gratitude in the smallest of things (e.g. the sunshine, the water, the contributions others have made to his life) and wants to share in that kindling of a new friendship to create new opportunities of gratitude and sharing

A little bit more about me: Single, blk, gay (though you do not have to be), 41. I like intimate coffee talks and smaller venues to get to know others, non-drug user, non-smoker to include 420, rarely drink. I also enjoy reading specifically books on dreams, hiking, exercise, good company, good movies. I find that for me it's not about the activities but the people I share those activities with that determine if I am having a good time.

Who I would like to meet: people with life experiences that have strengthened them but have also provided them with humility, those who know there is more to life than just the daily grind, those looking to connect with quality individuals and have their lives bettered for knowing another human in the world, those who have a great sense of humor but is also kind in their humor, and those who can challenge me to being a better person as I will challenge them out of my commitment to support others in being the best they can.

If interested, please say hello. Until our paths cross, I wish you all the best life has to offer.

I'm not sure what I hope will come of this, but it's a wish I'm brave enough to put out there. I know it's possible... I know that there is at least someone out there who has spent a lifetime wanting a sister to know deeply and be known deeply by... to laugh with, share secrets (and everything else) with, go on adventures with... trust and love. I believe that this is all possible because I know that family has nothing to do with blood and everything to do with how we treat one another... as an adult, it is a choice we have that we were not privileged with as children... we get to create our own selves into the people we want to be, and we get to choose for ourselves the people we want close to us, who we will call family. If you had a great family like all of us deserved growing up, perhaps you cannot understand... but then again, you're reading this, so maybe it wasn't as perfect as you hoped. 

I am hoping to find what I should have had... what was taken from me... what I've spent a lifetime wishing for. I'm a really good person, and a fiercely loyal friend. I have a lot of wonderful friends. But so many of them have sisters... and it's always an awkward conversation to have with someone who knows what it's like to have the thing you don't know what it's like to have. I don't want anyone to choose this connection because they feel sorry for me... I want them to choose it because they really want it, too, and it's something they have also wished for and hoped for and maybe never thought was possible. We've been led to believe that there are fences in this life, but there's not. So much is our free choice. 

Please send a note if you understand, and if you hope for the same.

Looking for a new friend that's into smoking weed, playing video games, watching tv, and listening to music. I'm new to the area so I would love to meet someone local with similar interests. Must be a pot smoker and must be able to come to me.

I'm happily married and my wife is aware and ok with me looking for new friends online. We're both very laid back and both very open minded. No drama, I promise.

She works during the day and my career doesn't require clocking in. So, if you're down to smoke some weed, drink some beer, play some video games, and watch some hilarious tv, please hit me up. I have a very good sense of humor and can talk about a subject for ages.

Hello Everyone! 

Its the beginning of a new year. A time for change and growth! Do you feel uncomfortable in your own skin? Do you HATE going to the gym for hours and never seeing any results? Do you want to learn how to eat healthy and take care of your body?? 

I am looking for 8 lovely ladies to take control of their health and their life. I will be right there with you shedding those pounds that I let grow for so long! 

Age doesn't matter. Fitness goals don't matter. All that matters is that you have a desire to make a change and are willing to put in the work to get there!

Change isn't easy, but it certainly satisfying when you reach your goals and see the change in progress. 

Send me a message or a text! I happy to answer any questions you may have!! :)

I am just curious as to what is wrong with me. I have days where I am able to stick to a routine and schedule and get a lot of stuff done, and then there are days like today where I can't get myself to leave my bed, let alone my house. It's not really that I feel depressed, I just have zero motivation to get anything done, not even to eat or take care of anything. It also seems to be accompanied by some strong compulsions. I was sober until today, but fell off the wagon of sort due to an almost overwhelming urge that simply didn't exist all last month. It is strange, I guess I have always done this but kinda live in denial about it. Would love your input if you have experience with this sort of thing. Thanks

So...I am looking for somebody who is looking for something, too. More than anything, just something interesting. Specifically, I am looking for somebody over 35, married or attached (because I am and looking to remain so), confident, smart, and funny. 

Me? I am early 40's, smart enough to not run with scissors, dumb enough to laugh at those who do and hurt themselves doing it...tall enough to see the dust bunnies on the top of your refrigerator, but wise enough not to look... I'm healthy enough to enjoy the benefits of gravity such as skiing, mountain biking, rafting...but clumsy enough to have accumulated some stories of my losing some battles with that gravity...active, energetic, creative, laid back, and open. 

Looking for email and/or chat conversations about anything interesting or funny...but only if we are a good fit! To find out, and to see if you are real or a SPAM bot, here is a little quiz (please be prepared to answer each question in your response): 

1. My favorite part of a man's body is __________. 
2. When I see somebody doing something stupid, I ________. 
3. The last time I laughed so hard I cried was _________. 
4. The place in Colorado I would or do most like to visit is _____________________________. 

Drop me a line and be interesting! Let's see where things go.

How about this for a great weekend?

I'm a business man from Washington, DC and I'm traveling through Denver this weekend. Because of the blizzard I'm going to stay an extra couple of days near Denver International Airport. Saturday morning - Monday morning. I don't have any plans but I have a great smile and desire to share!

I'd love to treat you to an all-expense paid weekend/getaway/stacation! Totally my treat. It would be something like this:

- Saturday afternoon / evening. Dinner. Movie? Dessert? Drinks!
- Sunday morning breakfast/brunch then massage at spa
- Sunday dinner and movie or perhaps some other entertainment
- Monday morning breakfast/brunch then I'm headed to airport.

If you're up for it - I'm a fit and white, educated guy. 

No worries... no pressure and I posted in strictly platonic for a reason. I have a girlfriend. I'm not seeking on changing that. But it would be wonderful not to spend the time cooped up all alone.

If you're in the same position and want to hang out and simply have a drama-free getaway with no risk or expense, let's do it!

The perfect ""date"" would be 25-35 and fit and enjoy smiling because we're going to do a lot of that!

I act professional and I have a working class memory. No pic really needed, just a willingness to meet at a bar and smile.

You know. . .dinner. . .movie. . .laughs. . .everything except the kiss at the end.

*crickets*

Lol. . .well excuUUUUuuuse me! This IS the platonic section after all! Don't get mad at me because you can't find someone in the personals section...get back in there! I don't care what you smell!

I have fun just going alone, but it's fun to make a dinner un-date out of it. Un-date...you know...just a casual meet up with no ""omg, what do I wear?"" or ""Is he going to call me?"" expectations. Just an hour of getting to know each other followed by a movie we both really want to see. (You know, as opposed to a date where one of us pretends to like the other's taste). Or we pick a ""film""...watch it, and then discuss the themes over dinner.

Best case scenario: We click as friends and do it again.
Worst case scenario: I slip a roofie in your drink and you wake up the next day wearing a diaper and missing a few fingers. 

KIDDING. . .sheesh. . .when did serial killer jokes stop being funny? :-P

I don't care what you look like as long as you're close to my age, interesting, like to laugh, and SINGLE. I know, this is just platonic, but you'd be amazed at the drama and plans that have to get cancelled when we introduce spouses into the equation. If you wanna swap pics because you ran out of luck on the ""romantic"" side, that's fine, but don't hit me with the ""pic please"" email. Put a LITTLE effort into caring about my personality. :-P 

Movies I'd like to see: Hateful 8, Room, Daddy's Home, Revenant, Spotlight, Big Short

I have met my fair share of CL crazies, but for the most part, I've met a lot of really nice people through here....so here I'm giving it another whirl since there are some movies I want to see. Looking to go Saturday or next week. 

Edit - Apparently ""Strictly Platonic"" means ""I want to date you"" because that's all the responses I'm getting. I REALLY don't care what you look like, and I don't want to pay for you lol...I just want to go see a movie without any strings, or being judged on my pics - geez!

Happy you stumbled upon this ad. I moved to Denver about 2 years ago, but still haven't made any regular or dependable friends. I'm hoping maybe you can help change that!

I always enjoy getting to meet new people and broaden my circle of friends and experiences. I love listening to/playing/writing music, chilling out with friends, seeing the world, painting, reading books, loving life, expanding my mind, having fun, and laughing my ass off while doing it.

If any of that sounds remotely fun, or you have fun ideas yourself, feel free to reach out and say hello :)

Put ""Bonnie and Clyde"" in the subject line so I know you're real.

Well I figure it's 2016 and I'd love to start out fresh with a new friendship. I'm not seeking hookups or let alone a relationship. I don't have guy friends really and I figure hey there's no harm in having friendships of the opposite sex.

I'll enclose a little about me, I'm 25, I work kind of a big girl job in a law firm. I love it. I love movies, music and tv. I also love going out to clubs and bars, being social. I also love cooking and I'm seeking new hobbies as well. I'd love to try pottery or something artsy one day, but I'm terrible. Anyway, I enjoy conversations about anything, whether it's serious such as politics and religion or silly such as reality tv, I love it. I have various interests, some rather questionable lol.

I'm also trying to workout more, be more healthy and if you're a health enthusiast definitely hit me up. I'm always up for learning more!

Anyway, if anything about this ad is appealing, feel free to email me, your pic gets mine and we'll go from there!

There are so many people in this world. Sometimes when I'm driving or walking around Denver, I imagine what each person's story is. As simple as where their going, or sometimes deeper like their motivations, thoughts, and life aspirations.

I figured I'd throw an ad up here and hope to actually find that type of story. It'd be great to meet someone new, even if only to make it so there's one less stranger to wonder about.

I'm looking for some (platonic) friends in the photography scene. It really doesn't matter the genre. I have been interested in for a very long time. But there are a lot of basics and such that I need to learn. I just bought a nikon 5300. My photography interests would include; people, landscapes, motorcycles, budior, and portraits. It would be nice to be able to do my own family's pictures eventually instead of paying another photographer to do them.

I am 31, a family man, homeowner, drug free, honest, non judgemental, Air Force Veteran, and open and willing to learn! I do have my own professional career, but only work three weeks on/ three weeks off, so I do have time to invest as well as can travel if need be.

I understand that it will take a while to learn, and then there is editing to learn too. If your looking for a friend with photography as an interest/ hobby, or maybe even an assistant, please feel free to send me an email.

Thanks

So I find myself in the ""isn't high school over???"" years. my best friend seems to have completely dropped me and I cant figure out why. So I have no adult friends any more (besides my husband), which... sucks.

I'd love to have a friend to come over or take kids to the park or mall, or swimming... or just an adult (NON SEXUAL) relationship. wondering if that's possible at all any more. I don't do facebook; i'm a stay at home mom who's a full time nanny, but weekends are free! i'm pregnant with my second kiddo, my oldest is 3. Gonna be quiting my nanny gig in a few months. I don't mind if you don't have kids yourself, just be fine with mine (he's an outdoorsy little heart breaker :p ). 

fave movies: harry potter.... fantasy, a little scifi, i'm highly amused by big foot shows, comedies... really anything but slasher death and bloody guts movies....
fave things to do: go to parks with my son, dollar stores, thrift stores, working out (i'm by no means crazy fit, but I like jogging and workout dvds), photography...
misc: i'm very much in love and happy with my husband (this is in platonic for a reason ppl...). i'm a Christ follower but not nutts. i'm ok with a little rec pot when my son's not around (and were I not pregnant ;p). I appreciate honesty the most in a friendship. I laugh easily and am pretty laid back. I like tattoos and piercings and would love if my hair would just GROW purple... ha. I have 4 cats...

I've got an interesting proposition for someone who's open minded. I am currently in a relationship, and while I'm very happy in it, I can't stop thinking about other girls.

I was hoping to find an extra special female, who would love to hang out, do fun things, share some forms of intimacy (cuddling, flirting, etc) but without all the sexual aspects.

I don't condone cheating, but really yearn for another person to become close with (without it being considered cheating).

Is this post most likely going to be ignored? Probably. But maybe there is someone in a similar situation that might find this to be interesting.

First of all let me start by saying I struggled with where to post this question. It is sexual in nature however I am NOT looking to hook up, so it could be in casual encounters. But since my intentions are not to hook up it could be strictly platonic. With that being said my question may come across as being unclassy but here it goes.

I woke up this morning feeling extremely horny and have been thinking nasty thoughts all day which is less than ideal considering I am at work. As I have been driving around I have been on occasion rubbing myself through my jeans. My question is probably obvious, but I will ask it anyways. Do women ever rub themselves while they are driving? Thinking about that in my head has only made my condition worse so I thought I would just ask. I probably will get flagged but what the heck, it was worth a shot. I look foward to some interesting responses and hope that i don't come across as a perv. Or a creep

Hello there to all my true fellow vegans (and all those interested) in veganism! I am a proud kid free vegan who made this compassionate and easier than I thought it would be switch this past summer (to all the awesome plant based foods and products out there in stores and online) looking for like minded people to be friends or roommates with who share this passion. It doesn't matter what sex, gender, color, ethnicity, height, religion, etc you are. (Unless you are a single handsome man who is vegan and likes to have sex, lol.) I am spiritual but not religious. LGBT are awesome people too! I don't discriminate about that stuff because I understand what it's like to be different or unique, discriminated against, and think outside the box. Being vegan is still rare/ in the minority but with my combined concern of animals and other causes I care about is what made perfect sense to make the change. The state that the world is in (animal treatment especially) will always be depressing unless it changes. How about you, what is your story? I am still learning and trying new products so if anyone has suggestions on what else to try I would love to know about it. I am a true animal person and willing to travel to meet. Which brings up my next question: Are any real vegans out there interested in opening up an animal sanctuary and/or growing organic plant based foods? I volunteer at animal sanctuaries already and would love to have a place to rescue animals someday (I'm currently unemployed) so if you have any ideas of how to go about this or interested in being a fellow vegan friend of mine great. Thanks for reading and ahimsa!

Hi there, I'm David. I'm a 29 yr old male born and raised in Colorado. First, a little about what I'm looking for....

I'm basically just interested in meeting new people in various ways. Everything from friends to hang out with, people to do arts with, a woman to love, or even a couple to become close with. I'm very open minded and am interested in getting out and experiencing new parts of life. I would love to find someone to personally connect with, but am also open to NSA fun with someone if it were to happen that way.

Now for a little about myself...

I am a very open, honest, and positive person. I enjoy many aspects of life, but really have a passion for arts. Especially photography and music. I enjoy the outdoors, and try to get out as much as possible! I love to hike and backpack or anything that gets me into nature. I am not really religious, but am very spiritual. I have a 5 year old son that lives with his mother that I adore dearly and see around twice a week. 

I work currently as a Real Time Analyst at a call center. In short, I basically make sure other people are working. :-P I'd like to get into the photography and music full time soon, and have been working on making that happen. I'd like to work for myself and not someone else! :-)

I was hurt really bad in my last relationship. She was older than me, and I thought that may work out as I was looking to settle down. She ended up leaving me for her boss's boss that was more successful and made more money. Obviously, you could imagine how that breaks one's heart!!

Well I hope this was enough information to give you an idea of who I am. Feel free to contact me for any reason you may choose. Keep in mind, I will be very blunt and honest. I'm sure I'll get tons of weirdos and spam from this, so I will be pretty critical weeding out the reals and fakes. ;-)

I have never realized how important it is to have great male friends. If we become friends and hit it off that is great. I honestly don't care if you're in a relationship or not, because my intentions are friendship and friendship only. But if you are single... If we become something more within time, cool. 

I have two guy friends but they are both in college and out of town. It is hard to get ahold of them, Skype or FaceTime them frequently. When I do catch them, they are busy or on the go. So I figured why not find another guy friend that could possibly be like them, but better. I tried to find guy friends at bars or hangout spots but guys are idiots at those places and just looking for some ass. If I was a guy, I would probably too... I love life. I love to laugh. I love to go out. I am a positive soul, positive spirit and positive energy. I adore animals, I love sports, hell I will give you advice on woman (we are complicated as hell). If you're single, we can cry together sometime when we are sad or just have tons of wine and play WII or something... I honestly don't remember the last time, I had so much fun... Girls are all about appearance and blah blah. That isn't me. Although, it is important... I want to have fun damn it. But anyway if this was somewhat appealing email me!

Fellow Denver Bronco Fans!!!!!!

Go Broncos! We brought those ugly, arrogant Steeler fans to their knees, and today I am savoring our victory and looking forward to doing the same to the Patriots next week!

Now for the fun part: I won a bet with my die-hard Steeler-fan boyfriend (I am a transplanted female Bronco fan living in Pittsburgh), and as ""payment"" for the bet, he had to post the message below to the Denver Craigslist website, and will have to read any responses received to me (I would have had to do the same thing here if we had lost - and the best part is, it was HIS idea!!!!).

Here is what he wrote, which I approved:

--

Hello Denver Bronco fans

I am posting this to pay off a bet that I lost to my girlfriend over the Steeler-Bronco game yesterday. Our mutual agreement was that the loser would post this on the winning team's Craiglist site and read any responses received aloud to the winner.

I am a die-hard, life-long Steeler fan, and as such, love to talk trash on any of our opponents (especially Cincinnati, Baltimore, New England, and Denver). My girlfriend is originally from Denver, and ""becomes nauseated"" at my, and the entire city's devotion to the Steelers. Of course, I had no doubt that the Steelers would win yesterday, and for most of the game I taunted her about having to post and read all of the responses to me. I couldn't wait to see her annoyance and humiliation at being personally taunted by Steeler Nation. After that last fumble, my heart sank, and you can imagine the glee in her voice as I was now on the receiving end of her triumphant, taunting tirade.

My ""punishment"" is to expose myself to you as a Steeler fan, and humbly profess my homage and adoration of the dominant Denver Broncos and thier fans. You have undeniably demonstrated to me that you are the superior team, and I barely deserve to be on my knees at your feet. We are asking that you take this opportunity to remind me of how pitiful my allegience is, and let you know that your response will make a lifelong Bronco fan enjoy and prolong the agony of a lowly Steeler fan such as myself.

I am to tell you that I look forward to reading your responses to my girlfriend.

Humiliated Steeler Fan

--

I dreaded having to post a similar message to Pittsburgh fans, of which he constantly reminded me during the game, but when we pulled off our victory, he was almost in tears. I ask that you please respond and let us know what you would say to him, no matter how degrading it is, the more the better! He WILL read every word aloud to me, and I am hoping to make it last for hours.

Thanks!!!

I love to learn from other people's experiences and wisdom.
I am a native of Denver, and would like to share my knowledge and experience, too.

Greetings and salutations!

Hope this day finds you well, friend! Well, I was wondering if you'd like to spend some free time talking about this and that, getting to know each other, swapping stories and some laughs? Honestly, I'm kind of feeling down lately, and could use a good hearted soul to pick me up throuout the day (I'll be glad to reciprocate!). Unlike the rest of the ""strictly plutonic"" guys out here, I have no intention of our conversations moving towards anything other than conversation between friends. If it moves past that, we'll cross that road when we get there. Until then, a modern day pen pal is all I'm looking for.

Well, I'm 33 years old, white recently divorced single daddy. I love backpacking, camping, fishing, early American history, gym time etcetera. I think I'm a good natured person with a funny bone second to none... and kind of a closet dork. Bearded with tattoos. I have no qualms about my new email or texting buddy, weight, shape, race are all irrelevant in my mind. Just have a warm and kind personality and we'll get along just fine;)

In any case hope this day brings you peace, comfort and tranquility!

I am a 30 year old female, single, no kids and I work full time, Monday through Friday. I tend to be an introvert, however, I enjoy one-on-one conversations and am not shy. My idea of fun is to go to the movies, out for happy hour or even to stay in for an evening at home with a good bottle of wine and pizza. One of my other goals is to frequent the gym more often, however, I am not looking for a workout partner per se. Unfortunately, nor do I ski or snowboard or any of the other Colorado-y things that most people enjoy doing. My roots are in the southeast and I plan to relocate back that way at some point, however, I would still love to make new friends to enjoy the remaining time I have in the state.

I love to read....basically everything except sci-fi. I'm all about Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia but that is basically the extent of my interest in fantasy. My taste in movies and TV shows varies wildly from old TV shows like ""I Love Lucy"" to the modern like ""The Middle"". One of my favorite movies I saw recently was ""In the Heart of the Sea"" (despite the fact that I did manage to slog through ""Moby Dick"" and it was so boring). 

As I said previously, I do am not dating/engaged/married/have children. I am totally fine meeting up with ladies who are, however, I would prefer to meet someone who actually has available time to hang out and get to know each other. I do not smoke (cigarettes or otherwise due to my job), however, I don't mind if you do providing it is not excessive (I have known women who could not watch a full movie without stepping outside to light up. That is what I mean by excessive). I also would prefer it if you live in the Aurora/Centennial area unless you are partial to driving. It can get challenging to meet often due to traffic and commute times if we're both living on opposite sides of town.

If you think we might get along and you're looking to connect with a new friend in 2016, send an email my way!

Thanks for reading :)

Hi!

I'm 29, m, happily partnered and have been involved with growing cannabis since I was 17. I have had the good fortune of trying cannabis and concentrate from lebanon, morocco, afghani, african (durban, swaziland, not the strains but actual flowers from these places) nepal, belize, mexico, aruba, curacao and a few other places I'm forgetting, oh yeah, Jamaican!! lol

Anyway, the point is, I am very well versed in LANDRACE genetics and am looking to network with people in LEGAL JURISDICTIONS to help support the preservation and propagation of these special genetics, which once lost to hybridization, exctinction, legal controls, etc CAN NEVER, EVER, EVER (seriously) be gotten back. You can NEVER beat what took thousands or millions of years to produce, all you can do is combine and recombine what IS ALREADY THERE. That means breeders only get to take credit for stabilizing hybrids, the magic COMES FROM THE LANDRACE untainted genetic pool. :) It's kinda a big deal.

I'm interested in ANY sort of collaboration. I'm a competent grower, preferring outdoors but capable indoors as well. I'm chemical-free entirely but that's not a pre-requisite for collaborations, just my preference (because why on earth would you taint rare genetics with synthetics salts, and X-icides, and all the heavy metals and carcinogens that go along with them?!?!). 

I'm open to assisting a grow or grows, acting as a seed repository where I will be happy to store seeds under ideal storage conditions (moisture, temp, light, air control), or whatever I can do to facilitate the protection of one of this planets greatest assets: It's heirloom cannabis genetic pool <3

I like healthy, voluntary relationships with people, who are respectful and easy going. I don't get along well with people who are unhappy, unfriendly, unkind, disloyal or egotistical. I like good energy and I avoid negative energy like the plague unless I see an opportunity to transmute that energy in to something pleasant or healing.

I used to be very spiritually, emotionally and physically unhealthy. Then I found cannabis, raw and traditional foods, and hermetics (ancient knowledge of quantum physics) and it flipped my life and perspective upright :) Now I just want to help others heal in all the areas I was (I say was, but there is a lot of remediation and healing to do in my spirit yet, this society is pathological by it's (unsustainably) consumptive nature) pathologically trapped with western brainwashing (skinner box, prussian (original nazi) schooling system, etc)

We have a chance now for a beautiful, free world, where we can do what we like as long as it doesn't harm others, let's help eachother make it happen!

PS: It shouldn't matter but I'm happily partnered with an amazing artist/model extrordinaire, we are in a poly relationship that is open to other dynamics and we work together to help eachother become successful in our respective fields of passionate labor. :) Thanks for reading, please email with greetings, encouragment, leads or just saying high! ;)

Hello, 
I am posing this on behalf of a friend who is currently in prison. Here is what he'd like you to know!

Are you looking for a pen pal? I am a christian man looking for someone to communicate with. I am currently incarcerated and need increased communication with the outside world. 
I am very compassionate, caring and peaceful. I have a strong desire and interest in self-studying in many subjects. I love to conduct research and to read. You could say that I'm an info junkie ;)
I care about, and for, others; I have a huge heart. Would you be interested in becoming pen pals? I invite you to please reply to receive my contact info (I do not have email access, this ad was posted on my behalf). 



If interested just shoot me an email I'll send you all the information to send him something.
Thank you!

I would like to find a female who would be willing to develop a friendship/roommate type of relationship. Doesn't require sex. I would be able to pay rent and utilities in exchange for a room and transportation to and from work. I can pay up to $300/week every Friday. I can also offer any repair work needed, free of cost. I will also contribute to cooking, cleaning, and any other chores. I'm looking for a fairly quiet, clean area near Boulder Colorado. If this appeals to anyone, please don't hesitate as I'm ready for the move and would only be bringing along my necessities.

I am a stay at home mom of my 8 month old daughter and looking for people to hang out with that have little ones themselves or don't mind me not really being able to get away alone. I'm pretty relaxed. I like to hang out at the house and bbq, play pool, movies, shopping (which I mostly mean walk around target for hours and end up buying the most random things I don't even need). Just because I am a stay at home mom does not mean I make my own baby food, cloth diaper, or baby wear 24/7. I get a lot of moms who want to hang out and then judge everything I do, so if that's you, don't even bother. I love road trips and seeing new places. I travel to California around 5 times a year and this spring i'm planning a long touristy road trip to Georgia =] I don't mind just being texting buddies either, I know how hard it is to get out of the house with little ones, esp in this cold weather.

Anyone else constantly invalidated for who they are? I'm here to talk if you need someone to remind you that No matter how you portray yourself, no matter the clothing you wear, that you are deserving of love and friendship and joy. 

I am Me. 
I don't give a Shit that I have a vagina, I am Male. 
BREAK DOWN THE WALLS IN YOUR MIND THAT SOCIETY HAS FORCE FED YOU. Or don't and continue to spread hate. Up to you. 

But I'm choosing love. 
I am deserving of love. 
I deserve to be proud of my body and proud of my individuality and I should love myself too. 
I am More than my genitals. 
I am More than my breats. 
I am not an object, not a fasination, not a prize, and not a demon or Satan's child. I AM HUMAN JUST LIKE YOU. 

Your dick does not FORCE you go wear a blazer instead of a dress. YOU ARE CHOOSING THIS. and if that choice feels safe and pleasant with you soul that is awesome! 
My choice safed my life. My choice to love myself despite my brain not matching my body was an act of self love over self loathing. I feel safe and content within my mind when I embrace ALL OF ME. my femininity and masculinity. 

Be proud. Be queer. Be gay. Be non binary. 
Believe in yourself. 
Love yourself. 
Take care of yourself because no One else will. 
Be your own best friend Because everyone deserves a pep talk at their lowest and a high five at their best. Pat yourself on the back for being true to yourself. 

Embrace Autenticity with Me

I was just wondering how many are digging in and working to follow their hearts on new paths they may have chosen. It isn't easy changing habits and changing your thinking but I am thinking it's worth it.

Sure would be nice to find a man or woman who may also like some support. No agenda here with something to sell or promote :) and don't have any preconceived notions about having to meet up, although if it goes that way that's cool too.

Just testing the waters to see if anyone can relate.....

**My goals center around health, nutrition and weight loss. The first two have been paving the way and I am starting to turn into a 'health nut' I think!**

Hey yall, I'm Cheyenne I'm 24 and I'm looking for some new people to talk to. I am a busy mom who works part time but I need someone that I can talk to! Let's message on Facebook or text or email, anything of the sort! I'm hoping to find someone who is in the same boat as me that just needs a friend to take some of the stress out of their lives. I'm 420 friendly, love Sci fi and fantasy along with anything crime related, and my 14 month old daughter is the light of my life. Let's talk! If you think we could have some things in common, email me with your favorite TV show right now in the subject. 





This is in the platonic section for a reason, I am happily married and am not looking to change that at all. Please do not respond if you are wanting to be anything more than my friend. Females preferred.

I serve at a steakhouse, enjoy the gym, I like the outdoors,hiking and exploring. I am a thrill seeker. I also enjoy playing video games. I want to find some more hobbies; kayak mountain bike parasail ect. I've never been snowboarding and I want to go soooo bad!

I'm a 23 single working mom that just wants to meet some gal pals to get out of the house and do fun things. Even if its just coffee and talking, goodness me that would be nice ha! I've been here a few years now but I have more guy buds than gals. Sometimes girls just wanna have fun ya know. Positive people only please, it can be a drag hanging around people that just see the shitty side of everything... Its unnecessary and draining... No thank you. Also I'm a blunt person with a sarcastic undertone most the time. So if you can't laugh at yourself or take things too seriously, we probably wouldn't get along.

Hello!

I'm a 25 year old female, who loves the gym and lifting weights, but lacks the motivation to actually get off her ass and go alone. 

I'm looking for someone (male or female, as long as we're roughly on the same fitness level) to help me establish some accountability and come workout with me. It will be fun, I swear. 

I have a 24 Hour Sport membership, and I work full time from 8-6 in Golden, and live downtown.

I'm a 35 professional male. I spend at least every third weekend alone with my 1 year old boy. I'm looking for people in the area who would be interested in hanging out with me and my son on the weekend. You can have a kid but not a requirement. If you do would be good if they were close in age.

Things I like :
Read
Listen to Music
Play Music (Piano/woodwinds/guitar)
Hiking/Walks/Outdoors
Exploring Colorado
Running/Lifting
Yoga/Spirituality
Dance
Gaming (video/board/card games)

I would love to find someone in the local are who would be available to hang out every so often as our lives allow. I dig open minded people who like to learn and experience new things. I work and have a pretty stable situation so if that's you also, that would be great. I do science for a living so if you are into learning about that I can teach you. I'm not looking for a relationship but someone who is fun and flirty is cool too. Age really doesn't matter but we definitely need to be on the same wavelength.

If any of this sounds good to you send me an email and lets chat.

As we stared across the room at each other, we knew we were meant to be friends. Even though we both knew we had rings on our fingers, it was risky to be seen together, but the risk was worth the reward. The reward of having a great friendship. Who knew a lady with heals likes to exchange those heals for a set of hiking boots and hit the trails. After a great hike, we stop at the local hot springs, you look stunning as we sit side by side in the hot water, snow all around. To laugh and have fun, perhaps stop and have a drink after a fun day together. 
I know it's all imaginary, but this or something like it could happen. 
Please don't judge me, I don't judge anyone for there position, we might be in the same boat after all!!
Maybe put a different twist to the story as well!

Hello!

For the past couple of years I have been traveling extensively for work so it has been difficult to meet new people and form friendships. My job obligations no longer require me to be on the road nearly as often so I would really like to make a new best friend or two in 2016! A little about me...

-Late twenties
-Live in Douglas County
-Happy, optimistic, and light-hearted demeanor
-Love traveling the world - been to 5 continents so far!
-Enjoy hiking, playing tennis, mountain biking (beginner), and water sports
-DINK (Dual Income, No Kids) but an animal lover
-Social drinker although not into smoking or drugs
-Favorite TV shows are Big Bang Theory, Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, AHS, Game of Thrones, Vikings, and Jessica Jones. 

You...
-Are not into smoking or drugs
-No children (I have some wonderful friends who are parents but it's very difficult to be spontaneous with them.)
-20s or 30s
-Looking for a platonic friendship only
-Positive personality

If you think we'd become great friends, please send a reply with a little bit about yourself and a picture if you would like. Looking forward to meeting you!

Did you know

Massage improves your rebound time after a training session......FACT
Massage affects specific genes in the muscle cells.......FACT
The first gene reduces inflammation, the second gene turns up the production of mitochondria. What is mitochondria you ask? Mitochondria is the biochemical processes of respiration and energy.

As muscle cells become adapted to endurance exercise, the number of mitochondria increases. Massage helps this process along. 

Massage = FASTER muscle recovery.........FACT

Contact me to schedule a massage AFTER your next workout. I'm fit/young and can definitely help your muscle recovery.

Hello everyone, I'm relatively new to Denver, so I haven't had a chance to make any kink friends, but I would love to go to this kink party tonight and meet some people. I'm looking for a date for the event; I'll pay our entry fee; sex is not a part of it (although open if we like each other); I would like someone who is interested in the kink scene; we'll be mostly hanging, chatting with people, observing, and if you'd like, we can play. I'm on Fetlife as init_kink, so you can check me out on there. Let me know. You can text me at

What ever happened to just enjoying a nice relaxing evening or weekend? I don't mind getting out from time to time, but given my schedule, it can be tough to find others that are similar. 

I mainly seek a good conversation. If things go well I'm not opposed to being friends, lovers, or spending my life with the right person. 

I'm 5'5"" Smoke cigarettes/vape... Enjoy sports, cartoons, and relaxing as much as possible. I also love intimacy, communication, and as close to a drama free existence as I can.

Many people have a deep seated fear of appearing nude in a public setting. In fact for many, it has been observed that only the fear of public speaking rivals public nudity for the power to induce sheer terror in the hearts of many of us. Still being nude in public holds a certain degree of appeal for many of us causing it to be an experience that some secretly long to try. If you've ever given thought to trying social nudity but feel that you are just too nervous to try it, allow me to offer some suggestions that might enable you to overcome your fear and embrace the joys of going au naturel.

Fear of public nudity is quite common and natural given that most of us have been socialized since childhood to feel that exposing our bodies in mixed company is wrong or even sinful. Coupling that with that the common fear of the unknown that most human beings have, one can quite readily understand why someone wouldn't be immediately comfortable with the idea of going nude in a communal setting. Phobias are usually best overcome by taking small steps. As a child you first learned to crawl, then to stand, then to take a few wobbly steps and much later you finally learned to run. This is a good method to employ in any endeavor that you feel is challenging and just a bit scary. Take your time and progress by taking small steps.

I can feel you.

The guilt you feel for ""letting"" your body go.
But what if you didn't let your body go?
First of all, I'd like to invite you to let go of any guilt you have about this.
Because your body is doing something for you.
We just need to see if we can figure that out.
I am not your typical trainer, meaning this wouldn't be just about the food you eat, or the exercise you do or don't do, but how you think and feel about yourself.
I don't work in quick fixes, but in helping people shift their lifestyles.
Giving them the tools to do so for the rest of their lives.
If you are interested in heading down that road, I offer a complementary consult/ workout to see if we can work together.
Let me know if you are ready for that.

Hey! I am 22 year old male that's in a committed relationship but am seeking a ""female best friend"". By no means am I seeking a sexual relationship and would actually prefer a lesbian best friend (as to not make my woman upset lol). I am super active. I race dirt bikes, long board, bmx, and I work out every day. I also like to socially drink on the weekends, downtown, south Broadway, all the usual spots. I would prefer to be friends with someone who has similar tastes, but it's not required haha. Hit me up!!

I lost my best friend, my dog about a year and half ago, and at that time, I knew times were going to be lonely and hard, but I didn't think those times would last this long. In the past few years, past several years actually I have had a series of bad luck, bad women, lying women, cheating women, scamming women, dishonest business associates, people who lied to me in so many ways... Most recently, a week ago actually, I went out on a date who I met on here. We had a nice dinner together, a hot make out session in my jeep afterwards, she told me I was a great kisser... and what happens?

She stood me up for the date we had the next afternoon, no texts, no call, no nothing....And so... Here I am alone in my place, in my life, wondering what I have done to deserve this? Seriously, I have wronged no one, in a very, very, very long time... I have not cheated, I have not lied, I always try and put peoples happiness in front of mine, and what happens? Nothing good, thats for sure... 

The only thing that is keeping me grounded and hopeful right now is a business venture, something I have been working on for over 15 years in one way or another. Maybe this will finally be the big break I have been hoping and praying for, for all these years... If it does not pan out in the next 2-3 months... I think I will just figure out a way to get out of this dark, cruel, evil world....Why am I writing this now, on here? I don't really know... Maybe there is a single, attractive woman out there who has had a similar streak of luck? Maybe there is someone out there who can identify... I don't know... I know I don't have much faith in the human race these days, that much I do know...

I used to drink myself out of these lonely feelings, but I quit doing that, as I realized that is no solution... So I am here, alert, not really tired, surely sober, and wondering to myself... what is the solution...I think to myself that I am either cursed, or I am to picky for my own good,... maybe I should lower my standards, I live a healthy life, I work out, I have a pretty tight body, and a very vivid imagination, a very artistic, mystical, compassionate mind....

Sometimes I think maybe I should not look for a woman who is in shape, who is exceptional in any way shape or form. Maybe I should date a ""plane jane""... but the reality is... I can't...

Well... Welcome to the novel I'm writing here on Craigslist! I know it's not the norm here to write such descriptive ads, but after looking through the ads, I've come to realize that all of the ads here are either pictures of someone's junk, or are severely lacking in what a person is looking for. 

To begin, I'm only here because I, like most here are lonely in life. Over the years I've seen my close friends find significant others, get married and sometimes have kids. I, on the other hand have chosen to focus on my career, become financially stable, advance professionally, gain respect among my peers, and plan for the future. Yes, I may have a 401k and a paid-off house, but it all came at a cost emotionally. 

The past decade has seen me travel to many different countries, experience different cultures and learn lots about myself as an individual. My friendship circle has barely reached beyond those that I met before this ""journey of myself"" through work, and is now dwindling to only those I can count on one hand. Anyone I have dated or fallen in love with over the past decade has either ended up, (most of the time unbeknownst to me) committed to someone else, or has been discovered to be leading me on in one way or another.

Along with being hurt relationship-wise, I have also had to deal with previous emotional trauma that makes it difficult for me to venture out. This doesn't mean I'm against meeting new people, nor am I fearful of it, but I am a little bit more cautious when it comes to trusting anyone. I've conquered my anxiety issues, but a bit of PTSD still exists from prior experiences. This does not mean I will flake at random times, as my integrity means I will follow through to anything I commit to.

Sad story aside, I don't seek pity, nor do I seek acceptance for my mental flaws -They are my cross to carry, and I'm dealing well. These issues are all part of the journey of life, and without them, it (and I) would be damn boring. All I'm seeking is someone to get to know, get to trust and experience life together with. 

If you aren't deterred by the sob story above, I'm happy you are still reading. 

If I were asked to describe myself, I'd say I'm unique (like everyone else...ha). I was raised a country boy, small town, genuine and a ""call it like I see it"" personality. I can't stand drama, I love giving shit to others, and I can receive it back like a champ. My idea of fun is a weekend fishing or hunting with like-minded individuals, or a weekend of exploring the wilderness in a 4x4 or 4-wheeler. I ride a motorcycle, have a truck and know how to gut a buck in near darkness (haha). 

To be honest, I'm a bi dude who leans towards dudes, but this ad isn't about sex. I'm an open book, and I'm honest about who I am. I'm here for a friendship, but if something beyond that happens, I'm game. I've had both girlfriends and boyfriends, and I loved all of them the same. All of my girlfriends broke my heart more than my boyfriends, so that may explain my leanings. That aside, If you tell me you're straight, bi, lesbian, asexual, gay, etc. I respect what you tell me. Since I'm a face-value type of guy, I don't make any moves past friendship, nor do I break up existing relationships. My straight and gay friends know about me, and trust me to not push - as do their significant others. I value friends over prospective ""flings."" -references are available upon request to back up that claim. Ha. 

So, with that mentioned, if you're a guy, I'm loyal as fuck and will back you up with my steel-toed shit kickers anytime you are crossed, and I'll never suggest anything outside of boundaries you establish. If you're a girl, I'll be that guy who will be there to talk, converse with and support you in every way a friend could -without me suggesting physical anything unless YOU suggest otherwise. If you're asexual, same above and I won't question the way you are made, and enjoy the interaction. If you're in a committed relationship, I'll be the best buddy I can be to support both you and your significant other, since you'd be a package deal in my mind.

Quite simply, I'm an educated, bearded grizzly-Adams type guy who is lookin for great people to share experiences with. I may live in the city, but I'm far from it. I'd love to find other like-minded people to start a friendship with. I can't be the only country guy (or gal) forced to move to the city who meshes. 

Yeah, I'm long winded, but at least I'm honest. What am I looking for? Someone to enjoy life with. Movies, eating out, hiking, fishing, hunting, off-roading, cars/trucks, music, political debate, cartoons (lol), etc... These are all things I'd love to experience with someone other than myself. 

If you're into a steel-toe wearing, blue-collar pickup truck driving type of guy, I may be what you're looking for. I have vices like anyone else, so get off your high horse. I drink, I chew and I socially smoke...I'm more than my vices though. And yeah, I gots baggage, but who the hell doesn't? 

If you're interested in a friendship or more, I'm amazed as fuck, so definitely send me a message. Tell me something interesting about yourself, and maybe we can meet up for a beer or good bourbon. I'll guarantee I won't have any pretenses past a good conversation and feeling out our personalities out for a match. Nothing to lose? As for you, I typically gravitate towards those around my age and younger, but if you're ""young at heart,"" I'm all for seeing what we have in common. 

Send more than one sentence. I want to know about you! Have a great day/night/etc!

Young, professional, sexy female looking to rent a room in a house/apartment where smoking indoors isn't a big deal. I've been searching for the right place for almost two months and can't quite find what I'm looking for. 
I'll be starting my new job this month but where I choose to live determines what location my job will place me at, kind of a catch 22 lol...Which means I'm looking to move ASAP! 
About me:
I'm a Sagittarius professional artist from Northern Colorado, moved to Denver after my first year of college and I love living in the city. I enjoy being social and active, I'm hoping to find roomies that won't mind my friends coming over for a nightcap or a smoke sesh. I am a dancer (not a stripper) so I'm always playing music and hopping around. I love to cook, especially recipes I've never tried, so if you like to eat...you can always join me for midnight munchies or a multi-course dinner. As far as dishes go, I'm not looking for a neat freak roomie...I'll do the dishes within a day or two of making the mess, I'm definitely one to enjoy my meal and not run to clean afterwards. Everything else...I'm on top of it! 
About you:
Just looking for a chill roommate...no drama, no heavy drugs, please be friendly and respectful. A nice person to hang with after a long day or just wave to in passing...I know you're out there! 
Looking to move ASAP...month to month preferred. 420/cigarette friendly indoors would be ideal. Dogs ok, I'm allergic to cats, no pets of my own. 
Thank you for your time. 
Have a rockin awesome new year!!
P.S. I'm in the swinger lifestyle...a sexy couple or open minded single male or female are very welcome to respond!!

Hey guys
I'm looking first and foremost for people to get to know. To learn about. To talk to. 

Some of my favorite things on the planet are music, video games, football, and my friends. I work 50-60 hours a week, so I want my time off to be as much fun as possible. 
I'm primarily an rpg gamer but do branch out a bit when the mood strikes. 
I'm a diehard Broncos fan, but appreciate a good game regardless of the teams playing. 
My music style is as complicated as it is diverse. I listen to a bit of everything, though I'm currently in a ""phase"" that includes funkstep, electronica, and alternative rock. I'm unpredictable musically. 
Anyway, enough about me!
I'm not real picky about who replies - limiting my audience would automatically reduce my chances of reaching the person I'm here to meet! If you want to talk and see if we get along, send me a message. Put your favorite passtime in the subject line. You can also reach me on kik at sonic_bloom

Look forward to hearing from you!

Hi my name is Adam. Since this is a CL personal's ad, let me first be clear on one point: I am NOT on here looking for sex. Not now, not down the road once you know me better. If that's what you think friendship is, well there are (and unfortunately from my viewpoint) a lot of posts from people who agree with you. Try them.

Now that that is out of the way, let me tell you a little of who I am and why I AM posting on here. It will be the first time I've done so. I'm posting on here because I believe the world we live in makes deep and intimate human connection difficult and therefore hard to come by, at least for me. Honestly, I don't know how to build a real friendship when for many people, the occasional ""like"" on Facebook or ""LOL"" text message constitutes friendship. That and all the rules that forbid men from getting close to one another physically, emotionally, spiritually, or any other _ally unless they are into homosexuality. Sorry, but I reject both the notions of superficial non-connected friendships as well as the opposite that ""real men"" only interact in fist bumps and bro-hugs and don't actually have any kind of feelings or need for anyone but themselves unless for sex.

What I wish I had right now was a friend, about my age, who feels as deeply about things (and other people) as I do. Who isn't afraid to show it. Who isn't afraid to talk to about hard things, but whom I can also go out and do things with, be real with, have fun with, and feel like said friend desires and values me as a friend as much as I value him. I'll be honest, there are some hard things in my life, some that I haven't completely figured out yet. I wouldn't be on here posting that I need friends if that were not the case. But as I said, I also would love to have another man to just do things with. I like racquetball, ping pong, camping, hiking, volleyball, disc golf. I love conversation, and I don't avoid the difficult topics. But I find that I sit around entirely too much since I haven't found anyone to do any of that with. A little help on that front would be appreciated.

I should also say that I have deep convictions about a lot of things, religious, moral, political to name a few, and am not afraid to discuss those topics, as long as it stays respectful. But those convictions also are a way of life for me. I try my best to actually live according to my beliefs, though I often fail at it. On that note, I don't drink or smoke anything so meeting up for a drink or 420 isn't my thing.

If you likewise want such a friend, I may be your man. Just so you have a little more idea of who I am, I'm 29, from South Carolina, but live in Centennial now (near at least some places in Aurora). I am looking for friends around my age (say 20s to about 35 maybe). Not that I mind older people, I just feel I need a peer more than a mentor. I travel a lot for work, which sadly means I'm sometimes gone for a few days at a time, hence at least part of the hard time finding steady friendships in my life.

I probably am one of the more unusual men you'll ever meet. I guess a man who looks for other men in CL ads for anything other than sex is already a little weird, but hey, you're looking in the platonic section too, so let's be weird together. If you'd like to talk more or meet up, feel free to email back. We can start there.

Hey,

Pretty new to Colorado and my work consumes me! I'm not looking for a fwb, nsa, blah-blah-blah thing here. I've recently realized that while I love to do all kinds of adventurous stuff (oh, and I happen to be excellent at planning them) I don't seem to care for doing things alone. Not sure why. Maybe I need someone to laugh at my crummy jokes or just someone to ""bear witness"" to the crazy situations I always seem to find myself in. Anyways, who doesn't like to wake up and just hit the road, off in an unknown direction, stopping and exploring whatever you see on the way & ""playing it by ear""! My closest friends have always been female and so i'm gonna stick with that as I post this on CL. I like to drink, smoke weed, and have a quick-witted-Daniel-Tosh sort of sense of humor. I consider myself pretty laid back and i'm open to everyone. Just don't be a dick. That's my motto, that and everybody wang-chung tonight. 

OH! And if you like stories, I got stories. Most people think i'm a massive liar when I lay out my past for them! I'm not, just very lucky to have had an amazing life so far!!

Hi lonely people, I'm pretty lonely myself. Please don't get me wrong, I have friends, great friends actually, they're just all men. I would like female friends up here in Colorado. 

I'm not your local Colorado mountain man, I'm from Arkansas and where I come from, there was jack shit to do. I enjoy sci-fi, video games, comics (I don't care about the marvel/DC battle), learning about random stuff, and just working on myself. I think I'm fun, just don't really know how to make friends of the opposite sex that can respect that I don't just want to fuck them. I'm not in a place to be in a relationship and I don't know about casual sex, that depends on the person. 

I'm also not an overweight basement dweller that lives with his parents. :p

So, the bad. I have a panic disorder and go to intensive therapy. It's sometimes difficult for me to bounce out and go exploring. Until I figure this out, I don't want to fall in love. I mean, yes, I do. I just can't financially support very much and will not let another potential partner just take care of me, that's not fair and I have ended relationships because I wasn't getting better. They deserved better. :/ It fucking sucks.

Now that the bad is out of the way, I think that I'm a sweet, supporting, positive person. I'm pretty sure that I'm funny and generally a great person, I write this because my friends are amazing and have never let me down and I do my best not to be a shit friend. 

I just read what I wrote, it sounds like an application, not very much emotion, sorry about that, it's hard to write with fiery passion. 

Anyways, wanna talk about anime, animals, space, aliens, music, metaphysical science, spooky ghosts, scary movies, video games, or just bullshit? Browse reddit or 9gag and share our amazing findings? If you have the dankest memes, please share. Hang out and binge watch something on Netflix? Get some crayons and coloring books and listen to each other's music? I'm down. 

Please don't murder me, I doubt it would be pleasant. I will haunt you for forever and be totally mean. Favorite mug? I'mma break it with my ghost powers after you pour your favorite drink. Want ghost shit all over your bed? No murder! 

Texting, emailing, phone calls, hanging out, yes.

I'm okay with sending pictures of myself and not a bot. 

If you're still reading, fuck yeah. Also, if I'm not what you're looking for, I hope you find some awesome friends.

Hey!

I am ready for a change in my life, and I'm thinking about moving to the Denver area. Right now, I live in Kansas City, and I really want to live in a more liberal/progressive part of the country, and I have been to Denver enough to know that ""in general"" Denver and Colorado match my morals a lot more than Kansas City & either Kansas or Missouri.

About me: I am a single, 29 y/o straight man coming from a mixed family background (My mum is Catholic; My father is Jewish). I am an extremely polite, nice, kind, person. Politically, I am definitely left of center (If you are even contemplating voting for Trump you can disregard this message; we wouldn't get along!) I love sports, and would be really excited to live close to the Rapids & an NBA team in particular. 

Right now, I am working PT at a furniture/home goods store that has several branches in the Denver area, so between 1 of these stores it would be probably easy for me to get a few hours a week to just get started, but I am wanting to change my employment situation.

I am going to get certified to ref soccer in March here in KC, and this will transfer with me to Colorado so I can ref soccer matches. I have a college degree in Recreation & Tourism Management, and I previously worked for the Philadelphia Eagles so I would be interested in getting involved with the Rapids, Nuggets, or one of the sports arenas.

Lastly, I am 420 friendly. As a former basketball player who has had 3 major knee surgeries, I do believe in the medicinal benefits of it for pain/arthritis. Once a resident of Colorado, I would be interested in getting my Med Badge and pursuing work opportunities in the MMJ industry. I do NOT need to smoke inside (although it would be nice) but like I said, I am a smoker so living with people that at least are morally OK with this is probably necessary.

That's me! I am looking for people to live with! New friends! I might only be working PT at first, but I have the financial ability to pay several months in advance with a security deposit, and I really need a ""home base"" as I pursue all these options I discussed.

Thanks for taking the time to read this post, and if I sound like I might be a fit for your home, or you know of someone who might be, I'd love to hear from you! Even if this is a temporary 1-4 month thing while I get settled and then find a different more permanent place to live, this could work too!

KC is not that far from Denver (I've been to Denver and Colorado a lot) so if anyone is interested in meeting me face to face it is no problem for me to drive out and meet people!

Hope to hear from some nice people! :-D

Cheers.

I have tix to Joe Satriani. The show is March 7, 8PM at the Paramount in Denver.

I bought the tickets a while back and the show snuck up on me. Thought what the heck I like a fair amount of his music and might be a good show. 

I'm married, my wife is not a fan of this kind of music, seems like my friends are busy, its a school night or they aren't fans either. 

So, I'm sincerely not looking for anything but a fan who might enjoy the show. Maybe we can have a bite to eat out somewhere before the show. I live N of Denver and don't get to explore it as much now as I used to.

Yep, just over 50 so I'm slowing down a tad. Like to cycle, hike and be outside like most CO folks. My musical tastes are all over the board. Big Zeppelin fan but have tickets to the Dead this summer too... Just for grins. Know of a place that has great pastry or a great appetizer? Maybe some local art on the wall...

Willing to chat or meet up this week for coffee or whatever to put anyone at ease. 

Anyway I'm pattering on. If something piques your curiosity please do say Hi.

Cheers

I am a good looking senior with no friends or family locally. I live alone and am going to have back surgery in a month or so. I will not be able to drive and take care of myself for a few weeks to a few months. I am looking for someone nearby who can help me with transportation to doctor appointments, to the hospital and back, errands, grocery shopping, light cooking, household chores and personal care until I get better. Any age range is OK as long as you can help me get to a standing position from a seated or lying down position and back again. I am willing to pay the going rate. At first it may be 24 hr per day until I see how independent I am. You may not have to be here if you live nearby and I can call you. I can supply references so you know who I am and can be trusted. I don't anticipate any medical needs other than pain meds.

It would be nice if a friendship or friendships if you have interested friends, developed as I need to increase my social activities. I am educated BS/MS. I manage real estate property for a living. I own my own house and have a steady income. I am a friendly sociable guy with varied interests. I like to travel again when my back is fixed. I have found it impossible to date or do anything that involves exercise or standing in line because of my back. Otherwise in good health. I like movies and TV shows. I am handy at fixing things around the house. I like going out to eat at a variety of restaurants.

If this sounds interesting to you, please send me a reply and a phone number and we can meet and go from there. You can ask me anything by email, if you like.

I'm posting this ad in the hopes of finding some new couples to spend time with, who aren't flaky and have the ability to commit to making plans ahead of time without always canceling at the last minute! I'm sure if you're taking the time to read this ad, you probably have friends like this - the kind who always complain about how they're bored and want to do stuff, but as soon as you propose doing something they're ""busy"" or ""can't go."" As you get older you realize you don't have the time or energy to constantly be the only side of the relationship putting in effort when it comes to spending time together. Therefore, if you are also a couple that wants to make new friends that are actually up for DOING things, let's talk! My husband and I live outside of Colorado Springs, but coming from the East Coast where it takes an hour to drive 15 miles on most days, driving doesn't bother either of us. Plus I figure that everyone here drives into the mountains throughout the year, so what's the difference in a one hour drive between the Springs and Denver suburbs if you have friends you want to spend time with?

One of the biggest reasons we moved to Colorado was to be able to enjoy the outdoors, so we want to meet other people who like to be outside and want to go hiking or visit new places on a semi-regular basis. We try to go hiking every weekend (though it's more low key now that it's colder), and I have a whole list of places I want to go in/around Colorado Springs and the rest of the state. Last summer we did a lot of hiking up off 70, climbed Quandary Peak and made our way out towards Aspen. We want to get down to the Sand Dunes and spend some time in Crested Butte this summer to see the wildflowers.

We have an awesome dog so if you like animals that's a plus. We adopted her over the summer and she loves trails, so she usually comes with us when we go hiking - unless of course it's somewhere dogs aren't allowed, we don't just bring her to be tools. Finding a couple with a dog that also wants to get out and explore would be great, but you don't have to have a dog as long as you don't hate them or something. 

My husband loves football, video/computer games (what dude doesn't?) and is in the process of getting his Masters degree. We both have hard science degrees, love to travel and do not smoke (anything). We don't have kids, and are looking for people in the same boat. 

If anything about this sounds familiar to you, feel free to shoot me an email so we can chat some more! I really hope there are some people out there who are in the same boat - there is too much cool stuff to do around here to sit inside and not get out and see it!

Unfortunately I have found myself at the end of a relationship. If you have been there, you know how that feels. I am trying to move on and keep trucking. 

About me: I am 33, (will be 34 in a couple weeks), average built, non smoker (of anything and you must be too), non drinker (an occasional drink or glass of wine here and there), d&d free and plan on keeping it that way. I am a disabled vet. I served in the Air Force as a Police Officer for 6 years as my first career path till I was medically discharged. Since then, after a few government security jobs, I learned Audio/Video and was an A/V Tech for a church for another 6 years. I also continue to do freelance work for a tv studio and other A/V installs occasionally. I have now returned back to school full time and I am in my first semester at MSU pursuing a degree for Computer Science. 
I do have 3 kids from my first wife, a daughter who is 16, and two boys that are 14 and 12. They live in Illinois and I get them out here for a month during the summers, other than that, I am all alone except for my dog. I do NOT want more kids of my own and have also taken precautions to make sure such things don't happen. If this is an issue and you think you may want one or more later on, then I'm not your guy, sorry. I am not opposed to the fact that you may have your own.
I love the outdoors. I love to go hiking in the mountains. I also have a Trailblazer that I have extremely modified for off roading and love to hit trails whenever possible and especially shooting. I love to fish or just go for walks on a nice calm evening. One of my biggest woo-saw's (stress reliever, for those that don't know what woo-saw is), is listening to Zac Brown Band on a quiet evening sitting at my fire pit. I love to laugh and make people laugh. I am more of the shy type at first unless I get to know you or am around friends and company I am comfortable with and love to be a clown and become the entertainment. 

What am I looking for: That's a good question, I thought I had what I always wanted but that turned out to not be the case. First off, if anything was to lead toward any kind of a relationship, you must be faithful and trustworthy. (Trust and faithfulness is a big deal to me and I will not compromise.) Someone that is close to my age, mature (but has a good sense of humor and a goofy side), non-smoker (this includes mj!), no drugs of any kind, non, or light social drinker, and preferably not a mouth your mother would be ashamed to listen too.

It's hard being human. Demands of the word, doubt, desire, duty and honor.

I am a person who struggles with all the above. 

What about Love? 

Just wanted say that where-ever you are- never loose sight of the truth and that is how much we are loved.

love is everywhere. 

Have a blessed day today and everyday.

Unfortunately I have found myself at the end of a relationship. If you have been there, you know how that feels. I am trying to move on and keep trucking. 

About me: I am 33, (will be 34 in a couple weeks), average built, non smoker (of anything and you must be too), non drinker (an occasional drink or glass of wine here and there), d&d free and plan on keeping it that way. I am a disabled vet. I served in the Air Force as a Police Officer for 6 years as my first career path till I was medically discharged. Since then, after a few government security jobs, I learned Audio/Video and was an A/V Tech for a church for another 6 years. I also continue to do freelance work for a tv studio and other A/V installs occasionally. I have now returned back to school full time and I am in my first semester at MSU pursuing a degree for Computer Science. 
I do have 3 kids from my first wife, a daughter who is 16, and two boys that are 14 and 12. They live in Illinois and I get them out here for a month during the summers, other than that, I am all alone except for my dog. I do NOT want more kids of my own and have also taken precautions to make sure such things don't happen. If this is an issue and you think you may want one or more later on, then I'm not your guy, sorry. I am not opposed to the fact that you may have your own.
I love the outdoors. I love to go hiking in the mountains. I also have a Trailblazer that I have extremely modified for off roading and love to hit trails whenever possible and especially shooting. I love to fish or just go for walks on a nice calm evening. One of my biggest woo-saw's (stress reliever, for those that don't know what woo-saw is), is listening to Zac Brown Band on a quiet evening sitting at my fire pit. I love to laugh and make people laugh. I am more of the shy type at first unless I get to know you or am around friends and company I am comfortable with and love to be a clown and become the entertainment. 

What am I looking for: That's a good question, I thought I had what I always wanted but that turned out to not be the case. First off, if anything was to lead toward any kind of a relationship, you must be faithful and trustworthy. (Trust and faithfulness is a big deal to me and I will not compromise.) Someone that is close to my age, mature (but has a good sense of humor and a goofy side), non-smoker (this includes mj!), no drugs of any kind, non, or light social drinker, and preferably not a mouth your mother would be ashamed to listen too. Also, I am not into bbw's, I'm sorry, but big girls are just not my type. You don't have to be skinny, average or a little extra is perfectly ok, I am just not attracted to bigger girls. 

I am not looking to jump straight into a serious relationship with the words of marriage being flung out next month, but I would like to meet some nice friends and see where things go. If there is a connection and it leads to more, I would not be opposed to it at all. If all of this sounds like something you feel you could match up to and/or would like to know more about, please at least say hi and don't be shy. I would love to hear from you. Good luck out there.

I'm looking for some new friends, people to just kick back with. A joint, a beer, a game of pool at the bar, maybe some poker. I'm an old school metalhead, Black Sabbath/Black Label Society type stuff. I'm hoping to get motorcycle #5 this year.

People are humans of habitual patterns. We do what we know is 
Comfortable. ItS not that we wish to be limited by our own boundaries that have
been conditioned 
Time and time again
Our mindset is that we are ordinary.
Why not be extrodinary? To the point
Where society would frown if our secrets came out?

We are a tight knit group 
Of 
those who have gone into hells abbyes and walked
Away with their heads still pointed to the stars
Of
Those who have walked the fine line of functionality and ruin
Of 
Those who just like blowing pretty clouds.

If your taste is pointed toward green to just hang out and lean about 
OR maybe some black to take you back? 
Blow to go some more or some crystal white to see the light. 
We accept you as who you are and wish to create a special bond with you and your partner/significant other. 
We want you to reaffirm that YOU, no matter your 
Delicate desires, are not alone.

If you send us a little about you , tell us a short bio
And what makes you extraordinary. 
We will respond in a timely manner and hopefully make a lasting relationship
Fulfilling the needs and wants of each other
You can come see me or I can come see you

Looking forward to seeing you soon.
God bless

One of the things I miss about a significant other is going to brunch on Sunday morning. The few girlfriends I have either go to church or have boyfriends and don't get out much anymore.

I love Snooze, but don't like to wait an hour for breakfast. Maybe you have a smaller, less crowded favorite breakfast place. I enjoy good coffee, conversation and meeting new people. There has to be someone else out there looking for something similar.

I'm 40 something, don't do drama, won't stand you up and can talk about a wide range of topics as long as it isn't sports. Although I do have an opinion on Peyton Manning given the recent news that's come out. Now I've probably lost most of Denver, but that's okay. I'm interested in quality, not quantity. Please be willing to meet somewhere in Denver, I live in the city and am not much for the suburbs.

Hello!
I'm a 24 year old person just looking for more people to spend time with cause my friends are usually super busy and I've been going stir crazy.

I am not that good at talking about myself without any direction. xD

I suppose I should mention that you should be able to come to me as I have no transportation of my own and my work schedule makes taking the bus rather pointless. 

I'm a queer artsy nerd and down for most activities. 

Feel free to hit me up. Tell me about yourself. Send a pic and I'll send one back.
For now, you get this picture of me wearing way too much clothing last october in hopes that I'll get less people contacting me for a sexual encounter than I usually do when I post these.

Hello, new CL bestie!! I'm new to the 30's (just turned last month) and am looking for a kick-ass girl to get to know. I'm huge into music and would be awesome to find someone to attend some local shows with. Not your typical Coloradan, as in I don't get down with the 420 and I would mind if you do! Just not anything I care to partake in, and would appreciate the same. As far as drinking goes, have at it! Haha 

I love watching Netflix and chillin on the weekends, even a lot during the week. Going out ALL. THE. TIME. is just overrated and SO expensive. I like home-cooked dinner and watching tv, or just having great conversation and then grabbing some dessert and walking afterwards. I work a M-F job that I love and that allows me to have tons of fun (just bought a new car!!). 

Would be great to find a cute girl to go hang out and just have fun with. I'm all for if you're a healthy eater, as I would love to get in a little better shape (I mean, me being 'fat' is 6', 200 and running 3-4 miles a day! Haha) I'm an advocate of working out, but really don't care if you do. Would love someone that can go grab Mickie D's with me for dinner on a random Wednesday night! All in all, just looking for a fun girl that would enjoy the company of a fun guy! :) Someone that can and will talk about anything, from sex to movies to the idiocy of politics and religion (and if you're a fan of those, I'm very respectful and will value your opinions! :), and everything in between!!

Ask away with any questions you have, and please be a good conversationalist; nothing kills a friendship boner quicker than poor communication skills. Haha And I would like if you sent a photo, as I will do so in return. I hope you enjoyed my random novel, and have a great day! :D

My boyfriend and I just moved here from Florida. I love it here so far, but I know about two people outside of work. All we need now are some like minded individuals to geek out together. 

STOP NOW if you are looking for anything other than friendship. I do not want naughty photos. Not looking for a hookup or anything of the kind. If you are planning on emailing me asking for 'noods' please just forget this post or I exist. Ok now that that is covered back to the actual post lol

We have pets so would prefer if you weren't allergic as we are always covered in pet hair of all kinds.

We are BIG time gamers. I collect consoles, but my boyfriend is a PC gamer. Also love us some boardgames! Would be great to meet someone who loves boardgames, so we could set up game nights. We do not play your typical boardgames though. No monopoly! Warning: he is a sore winner/loser. Don't play with us if you can't handle A LOT of shit talking and competition.

I am a crafter. Mainly I cross stitch for my Etsy shop. I am learning to knit and crochet. I sew, but it is mostly liners for my chinchilla cage lol. I want to try more hobbies, and have a shopping buddy for the craft shop. Be prepared to spend hours in there if we go. 

I bake! Food is a passion. I love to bake and cook. I eat meat, but I don't care if you don't. 

As for reading, films, and such. I love scifi! I read mainly science fiction. I watch The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Girls, Once Upon a Time, Bojack Horseman, The 100, Orange is the New Black, etc. I love Battlestar Galactica and Firefly. I will watch almost any movie or show except I HATE ALL THINGS TWILIGHT AND FIFTY SHADES. Favourite movies: Star Wars, Stardust, Hitchhiker's Guide. I love anime! And I am Studio Ghibli obsessed! 

Please never use the words: Bae, Turnt, Thot, or Fleek. They are not real words. I don't mind if your spelling sucks or even grammar. Use all the short hand typing your want or we can have a conversation in emojis lol just not those words.

I work part time so I have A LOT of free time.

I curse like a sailor. If swearing bothers you I can try to watch my language, but you have been warned. My favourite word is the 'F word' which I say countless times throughout the day. I smoke like a chimney especially if I am drinking. I don't drink often. We are 420 friendly. 

I have a few disorders I try not to let get in the way of my day. If you were understanding when I have 'bad days' or 'episodes' that would be super! I have anxiety, depression, OCD, and mild agoraphobia.

My boyfriend and I are crazy immature. So, we would prefer friends in the 21-30 age bracket. Unless you are also immature then 'age ain't nothing but a number.' We do not have kids. I do not mind kids they just aren't for me. I lack the maternal instinct (no it will not come with time and I will not change my mind so please don't say this to me). I am crazy awkward around children. So, if you have kids I don't mind just don't be offended when I get weird around them because I really have no idea how to act. 

I do not care what your sexual orientation, skin colour, religion, or political stand is (unless you're a trump supporter. If you are again forget I exist). But if that stuff matters to you here are my stances on them: I am bi, white, agnostic (raised baptist), independent (Sanders supporter), pro-choice, etc. 


So, now that I have written a novel haha if you think we could be friends send me a message.

I'm a senior in college and have decided on my senior project. What I would like to do is photograph average, everyday women to try and prove everyone is beautiful on the outside.

Last semester I watched a video in class about how people use photoshop to create unrealistic pictures of women for advertising. I already knew everyone does this, but the outrage and hurt from the women in my class really stuck with me. This is for them, and for everyone else, who has ever felt ashamed of themselves.

What I'd like to do is find as many women as I can, all age ranges, all body types, all skin tones, and photograph them. With the right lense, lighting, angle, background, etc, I can prove anyone can be a model.

I would like to do fully clothed, partially clothed, and semi nude, that choice is totally up to you. I can also make sure your face is obscured. And of course, you will get a copy of every picture I take.

If you'd like a free photo shoot, to feel like a goddess, to help me complete my project and to give those fake models a big middle finger, I'd love to talk to you. Thank you.

My husband and I have been living in Denver for about a year and a half now, and I really haven't had much luck making friends here. We moved here from Florida where I was stationed. I was active duty Air Force for 7 years and now serve in the Air Force Reserves. I am also a full time culinary student at Johnson & Wales. My husband is a nurse practitioner and a hobby machinist. We both love anime and go to San Diego Comic Con every year. We also workout and go hiking and biking often. We are not religious and people who are make us uncomfortable.
About Us:
30 year old female and 29 year old male, avid anime lovers(ask us about our figurine collection!), dog lovers (we have 3), happily married for 8 years, I'm quiet at first and takes me a little while to become comfortable with other people (never sure whats okay to say to other people, I'm very sarcastic and I think I'm hilarious (I'm often told I'm a little too mean)). He is very outgoing and loves bringing people together. We do not drink, smoke or do any drugs what so ever and would prefer friends who is the same, I am obsessed with makeup and frequent Sephora and Ulta on a semi-regular basis. I enjoy going shopping and it has been a while since I've been able to have a girls shopping trip (malls, shopping centers, yardsales, second hand stores, etc) and hubby is getting tired of being draggged along. We do not have children and am still not really comfortable around children yet ( I have no motherly instinct and borderline on being emotionally dead). I love cooking, baking and looking for and trying new recipes. We collect art from different comic conventions and are slightly obsessed with the Nightmare Before Christmas.
My favorite T.V shows are Charmed, Big Bang Theory, 2 Broke Girls, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Our taste in music is very random (country, Jpop, Rock, classic rock, 80's music, mowtown, etc) I think that should do it for now. 
If we seem interesting, feel free to email us.

My husband and I have been living in Denver for about a year and a half now, and I really haven't had much luck making friends here. We moved here from Florida where I was stationed. I was active duty Air Force for 7 years and now serve in the Air Force Reserves. I am also a full time culinary student at Johnson & Wales. My husband is a nurse practitioner and a hobby machinist. We both love anime and go to San Diego Comic Con every year. We also workout and go hiking and biking often. We are not religious and people who are make us uncomfortable.
About Me:
30 years old female, avid anime lover (ask me about my toy collection!), dog lover (I have 3), happily married for 8 years, I'm quiet at first and takes me a little while to become comfortable with other people (never sure whats okay to say to other people, I'm very sarcastic and I think I'm hilarious (I'm often told I'm a little too mean), I do not drink, smoke or do any drugs what so ever and would prefer a friend who is the same, I am obsessed with makeup and frequent Sephora and Ulta on a semi-regular basis. I enjoy going shopping and it has been a while since I've been able to have a girls shopping trip (malls, shopping centers, yardsales, second hand stores, etc). I do not have children and am still not really comfortable around children yet ( I have no motherly instinct and borderline on being emotionally dead). I love cooking, baking and looking for and trying new recipes, I collect art from different comic conventions and am slightly obsessed with the Nightmare Before Christmas.
My favorite T.V shows are Charmed, Big Bang Theory, 2 Broke Girls, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. My taste in music is very random (country, Jpop, Rock, classic rock, 80's music, mowtown, etc) I think that should do it for now. 
If I seem interesting, feel free to email me.

Do you need to be spanked or just like the idea? 

Would being held accountable motivate you to work harder on your personal goals, classes, traffic violations, over spending, attitude, general behavior, or some other problem? 

Nothing tells a woman to straighten up like a spanking.

For fun or discipline. Try it once, meet occasionally, or regularly like once a week.

I am understanding, but firm.

Do you like coffee? We LOVE coffee. When your dragging a little and you need a pick me up, have some coffee. When you can't seem to get it in gear or go fasT, have some coffee. If you go Ice skating and you need to warm yourself up, have some coffee. Coffee is even a great thing to bring to a parTy to show your host that you appreciate them. 

It's always girls like chrisTina and crysTal who seem to like coffee the most, and that's just fine with us. 

We are a couple looking for other couples or individuals to join our Coffee Club. The membership fees are low, but you always get quality service. We have several locations through out the Denver area, and also are mobile for Coffee Club meetings. 

If you would be interested in signing up for our Coffee Club please send us an email and we will review your request and reply as soon as possible.

To all the CL Ladies (preferably attractive lol),
Settling in town, don't have that big a circle of friends and thought this wouldn't hurt. I have been told to be quite attractive, fun, and intelligent (know the difference between their, there and they're lol).
The type where my group of friends would be shocked I even came to CL, so shhh, let's be discreet lol.

In my 20's, tall, come from a diverse background, Handsome and in great shape, high sex drive and just really enjoy the company of an attractive female. 

No specific type on my end, just be in shape, fun to talk to and good company. Fair enough?
I know there's gotta be normal people on here who are looking for the same lol, I'm sure I'm not the only one.

Also, I realized I'm not exactly sure what I'm wanting so keeping an open mind. I hope you would too... If we just end up being good friends, I'm happy with that. FWB? Sure. maybe something more or something less....

Add your age in the subject so I know you're real. Pics get faster responses!
Didn't add a face pic for obvious reasons, but if you're interested feel free to send a similar pic and we'll go from there!

I do like video games just don't play much. I also like watching movies and going to them. Hiking and camping are also cool.

I'm a photographer, somewhere between amateur and professional, who is looking for a woman to take photos of. Please do not feel you have to look like a model--if you do, that's fine, but I'm not necessarily interested in that. Age, race, height, weight etc. are not important to me either (though please be over 18).

I'm more interested in art than portraiture, and I'm especially looking for faces that are interesting to me in some way--if you can convey a sense of playfulness or a sense of mystery, that's more of what I'm looking for. I am NOT interested in taking nude photos, or doing boudoir shoots. I'm just looking to take photos of you in whatever clothes you like in a location that in some way reflects your personality. Fully-clothed can include costumes if you wish, if you feel a costume would bring out your essence. 

If you are interested, please send a photo or two that includes your face. I'm posting this in ""Strictly Platonic"" because I'm not thinking of this as a business transaction, but a friendship of sorts. If we work well together and it works out for both of us, I may want to take some additional photos when the mood strikes either of us. Of course you can have copies of any or all of the photos to use however you like.

So far we love Denver and all of Colorado that we have been to so far! Some of the things we like are: Hanging out, watching movies, dancing, fishing, camping, motorcycles, road trips, playing pool, games, he is trying to learn a bit about photography, I am a very girly girl, I like getting my nails done, shopping and getting dressed up to go out.

He is an Air Force veteran who now works an odd work schedule out of state, and I am in the admin field We are both professionals, ddf (drug, drama free), and an every day average family! We are proffesionals, homeowners, but fun!

Hello :) I'm bored at just looking for some friends to chat and maybe hang out with. I work a lot, so it would be nice to chat with some cool people to pass the time, maybe make some new friends. I have tons of pictures and and open to just about anyone, anything or any subject. I have an awesome career, my head is on straight, and I'm not a druggie :) Send a little about yourself, pic4pic, and a subject and maybe we can chat it up a bit.

I'm just a guy in search of an amazing woman. We all have our ups and downs in life, and admittedly I'm in more of a ""down"" time. I miss having someone to talk to and hold. Someone to share the times with, good and bad. I miss giving and receiving affection and massages. Hell, I miss sex... But that's not the most important part.

For starters I would love to find a great conversation. If more develops then all the better. I'm open to just about any possible situation and/or type of friendship/relationship that suites us and our lives as they are currently.

If it matters:

I'm taller than 5'2"" but shorter than 5'9"", not fat or skinny, booksmart but not entirely streetsmart, but I do have common sense. I'm single, live alone, no offspring, no pets at this time. No tats or piercings, but I am hairy so I guess that can count... But not overly hairy ;)

I've done one these before with no success, but I'm all about second chances and I'm gonna give this another try because why not. I've got nothing to lose, but only hope to gain a friendship.

So I'm just gonna put this out there and say that I'm seeking a legitimate friendship. I don't want a hook up or a relationship. While we don't have to meet, I'm okay with a pen pal type of thing. 

I'm super nice, I get along with almost anyone. I'm kind, sweet, and totally down to earth. I love almost all types of music, love movies. My idea of fun involves going out or staying in being lazy. I like deep conversations, long walks, cooking, exploring new interests. I'd like to take up something artsy like pottery or painting. I'm not artistically inclined at all, but I'm intrigued. Pop culture and current events are topics that I'm interested. I'm a walking contradiction at times, but I make up for it with my awesomeness, haha. I can be funny and corny jokes is one of my favorite things. 


Anyway, if anything sounds appealing, feel free to email me. Let's get to know each other!! I am real, and I can prove it.

Well I've tried CL before and didn't have luck. I'm hoping to have better luck this time around.

Anyway here's a little about me, I'm looking to make new friends because as I've gotten older I've seen how life can get in the way sometimes and drift apart. I love meeting new people and I'm hoping this platform will work :)

I'm a girly girl, I love shopping, getting hair and nails done. I could spend countless hours at Sephora because I love makeup a lot lol. I love happy hours, going out to bars and clubs, I'd love to have a wing woman, it'd be nice. But I enjoy staying in watching movies, tv and netflix as well. I like trying new things and have always wanted to paint and do pottery. I'm always up for finding new hobbies. I've recently started a weight loss journey and it'd be nice to have someone to work out with too or maybe exchange healthy recipes as well?

I'm super nice, talkative, outgoing and sweet. If you think we'd get along feel free to email me

Let's run through the pros and cons shall we:
1. It could cure you random bouts of boredom 
2. You could laugh so hard you pee your pants ( not certain that's a pro)
3. You could have someone to bounce ideas off of such as should I switch jobs? Should I get a cat? Should I wear underwear today? Just to name a few 
4. You would have someone to flirt with ( I'm not very good at it, you probably won't even know I'm doing it!)
5. You would have someone to vent to, ex... Maybe you had too much to drink at the office Christmas party and secretly made out with your girlfriend and she ended up telling everyone ( not judging) or maybe you got home from the salon and your husband/boyfriend didn't notice your hair! In either case I would respond with a snappy and disbelieved ""ohh noo he/she didn't!"" And proceed with an intense conversation of how your friends are ugly and suck!
6. I'm from Iowa so know worries that your going to fall in love with my charming and witty banter and leave your spouse for me
7. I'm hot ( hey who doesn't want to talk to someone that's hot!)

Cons:
Yeah, I got nothing here

I haven't been out in months, not sure what I was waiting for but I'm sure it's passed by now. I want to come pick you up. We can eat at a restaurant of your choice or you can trust that I know some great places to eat. Like Mexican food? Me to! So it's settled. Well go to my favorite joint for dinner. After dinner we can go our separate ways or you can hang for evening. I plan on club hopping down town, or at least start there and see where the cards place us. I'm not a big drinker so no worries there. I do like to dabble in club favorites occasionally. I believe this is that occasionally mentioned above. So what do ya say? Wanna free night on the town?

Im not super social, I spend a lot of time alone. Working endless hours keeps me out of trouble. I dispize drama. Im Doing my best to simplify my life. I'm newly single after many years so I'm new to the single life . Living alone is awesome. I'm not looking for a girlfriend or to get married.

Hey there,

IDK why I'm doing this. On one hand I'm pretty done with the whole relationship thing, cause it always ends with pain. In other words I've kind lost hope. But on the other hand I have this stupid primal/biological desire for intimacy. It sucks even though my mind is telling me no my heart says yes. Its not that I have high standards but, specific standards. I just want some one normal, human, exciting. Some one that has there ups and downs but for reasonable reasons. Someone who can be eccentric about certain things and can back it up. I guess I just want someone with a good head on their shoulders. That to me is what is sexy.

So anyways if you just wanna hangout and chat, maybe hop in my hottub, or come up with some crazy adventurous date then email me. Pleas include a picture. I get it we all suck at taking pictures, just do the best you can.

It has been written that you learn best via teaching others. So I would like to teach some others random things about dating and maybe learn a few new things in the process or have a few laughs about humans. I've been dating quite a long while, in between some long healthy relationships. Also have been studying psychology and sociology for many years. At this point I'm not confused or surprised by much. 

Presently open to some random conversation. So hit me up to find out why your dating profiles on okc pof etc, or posts here are not working. Or things like the time tested question of what the fuck was he thinking, etc.

It's just like the title says "" you've got mail"". Looking for a email friend to get to know and talk with throughout the day and become friends with. Everyone has ups and downs and I think it would be nice to have someone to talk to about those things. We can talk about anything as i'm open to really getting to know someone.

Anyone notice how it's harder to make and keep friends as you age? I certainly have! A few have drifted apart while others have gotten married and have kids.

I'm a guy that is just interested in friends. No romance or sex please! Texting or emailing would be great. About anything! I'm a nerd so I like books, movies, comics, games, etc. But I'm not so isolated or stuffy to not be interested in other things too!

Maybe once we feel comfortable we could hang out? Lunch/Dinner, museums, hiking. Whatever! I'm easy going and non judgement. Craigslist is a long shot but if anyone is interested drop me a line! Take care!

I have an opportunity I would like to offer to a female in her mid-50s/early 60s but there's a problem with putting this under ""jobs"" -- I really need someone who is a friend, or at least friendly, first and foremost. We have to talk and get to know each other -- sorry! Haha, that's just how it is. Yes, I do have a real-life female friend but she lives in another state. I need somebody who lives closer than that. This can and will definitely lead to a business or job opportunity (not to mention adventure and fun). 

So: You should be a smart, personable gal in her 50s/60s. You should be friendly and open to being friends with somebody like me. What kind of person am I? I'm not a guy! I have lots of different interests. I need one or possibly two people to do as-needed type work with pay dependent on skill and commitment level. Having some computer smarts and an internet connection, as well as a land line and your own transportation, will definitely help, but are not strictly necessary. A car and a driver's license will be needed, however. 

Otherwise, you'll find out when you answer the ad. (NOT looking for a hookup, dates, etc. Please do not reply if that is your interest. Also I am not interested in investing in YOUR business or buying insurance from you, or anything of that nature.) 

Hope to hear from you soon!

------

PS, let me reiterate that this I'm not looking for sex. If that's your interest, please move on. 

If you are broke and/or need a place to live, it's ok to reply to this ad. I've been in the same boat myself and I will help you out if I can. I will at least listen. I used to work in the mental health system so I might be able to help you find resources if nothing else.

Hi, I'm a nice, guy. I'm also married. The wife and I have been no more than friends for years and live separate lives under the same roof. I'm tired of being lonely in my own home. 

I have many interests that I would like to share with a lady that is interested. I would also like to share and get to know your interests. Some of mine are woodworking, fly fishing, tying flies, reading, chess, hiking, road cycling, dining out, red wine, craft beers, cooking, gardening and DIY projects around the house.

I am retired and spend most my days by myself. Because of the nature of my marriage I spend most of my evenings by myself. I have a lot of free time, even weekdays. I would like to find a lady, age and race make no difference, to share some of the things in our lives, see where it goes. I'm not interested in escorts.

Having been involved in athletics and personal training for 30+ years,
I've achieved a lot of my personal targets around athletics and my body.
I've been stuck on the couch and shifted back into movement all the while thinking I don't have the time to exercise or eat right.

I've learned what really created the shifts for me to be able to achieve these targets I had for myself. It isn't the work or effort I put into it, it wasn't forcing discipline or faking that having patience was fine. It was a shift in how I was choosing to think. How I think about the target itself and how I think about the journey vs the end goal.

I can show you this, build a plan for you around your exercise, nutrition and the mindfulness habits to support and get you to your targets!

Would you be interested in a complimentary 30 minute discovery session to see what is possible for you, and if we can build this plan together to achieve your targets?

There is no obligation to hire me, and you will walk away with at least one tool you can employ right now to help you!

Do you have a desire to feel more at ease with life, no matter what is going on?

Having your Bars run can do just that. There are 32 points on your head that correspond to things like; healing, body, control, awareness, creativity, power, aging, sex and money. Each Bar corresponds with that aspect or area of your life that it is named.

They store the electromagnetic component of all the thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions and beliefs that you have ever had about anything.

For example; every thought you have ever had about money that you considered important, the energy of that thought is stored in the Bar called ""money.""

Touch one Bar and you begin to clear away the energy locked up in that area or aspect of your life just by touching it, clearing the space for new awareness to come in.

The creative possibilities for your life begin to open up!

It's been said that at worst a Bars session will feel like a great massage. At best, it will change your life!

Are you interested in seeing what a 60 or 90 minute Bars session can do for you?

Its been a while since we've met anyone that we can really call a real friend and now we are finally beginning to look. we are fairly active and fit especially in the summer but winter time is hard. A few of our interests are going out to dinner, watching movies and games can usually be a lot of fun. We like fires and hot tubs, and shooting pool. Brad loves to ski and jane would like to learn. this sounds terrible so far but in the warmer months...Apr.-Oct. we belong to a pvt lake 60 mi E of aurora where we spend a good share of our time up there. we have a 21 ft boat and a 5th wheel and are really looking for our friends to come up and join us. so I guess we're looking for people that enjoy boating as we spend our time wakeboarding,waterskiing, wakesurfing, tubing you name it! In the evening a fire or just watch movies and it's nice taking the boat out at night as well. we are looking for fun outgoing respectful couples that just want to have fun and hopefully end up with a true friendship. we are not drinkers..we do smoke but plan on quiting soon and brad will smoke weed once in a while for medical reasons. we are young at heart,mind, body and retired, with a lot of free time. so if this stupid add interests you please give us a shout out. you have nothing to lose and maybe we will end up with a good friendship. Any age is fine..it's only a number and please send us a pic or two so we can see who were talking with.Have a great day..peace out..PS as far as the hot tub suits are optional,how ever if you were uncomfortable without one we would wear one not to be offensive.

I'm so tired of the monotonous same old same old. I'm not looking for love, my wife fulfills me in that aspect. Hence the strictly platonic posting. I'm looking for someone like me. Maybe a new best friend. Someone that intrigues me. I'm not easily impressed but maybe you can impress me? As for me, I'm one of those ""intellectual"" types. Not really geeky although I could nerd out on a few things. I speak very open and honestly which some people find a little blunt. Yes I can be blunt. Brutal. But very honest.

Hi lonely people, I'm pretty lonely myself. Please don't get me wrong, I have friends, great friends actually, they're just all men. I would like female friends up here in Colorado. 

I'm not your local Colorado mountain man, I'm from Arkansas and where I come from, there was jack shit to do. I enjoy sci-fi, video games, comics (I don't care about the marvel/DC battle), learning about random stuff, and just working on myself. I think I'm fun, just don't really know how to make friends of the opposite sex that can respect that I don't just want to fuck them. I'm not in a place to be in a relationship and I don't know about casual sex, that depends on the person. 

I'm also not an overweight basement dweller that lives with his parents. :p

So, the bad. I have a panic disorder and go to intensive therapy. It's sometimes difficult for me to bounce out and go exploring. Until I figure this out, I don't want to fall in love. I mean, yes, I do. I just can't financially support very much and will not let another potential partner just take care of me, that's not fair and I have ended relationships because I wasn't getting better. They deserved better. :/ It fucking sucks.

Now that the bad is out of the way, I think that I'm a sweet, supporting, positive person. I'm pretty sure that I'm funny and generally a great person, I write this because my friends are amazing and have never let me down and I do my best not to be a shit friend. 

I just read what I wrote, it sounds like an application, not very much emotion, sorry about that, it's hard to write with fiery passion. 

Anyways, wanna talk about anime, animals, space, aliens, music, metaphysical science, spooky ghosts, scary movies, video games, or just bullshit? Browse reddit or 9gag and share our amazing findings? If you have the dankest memes, please share. Hang out and binge watch something on Netflix? Get some crayons and coloring books and listen to each other's music? I'm down. 

Please don't murder me, I doubt it would be pleasant. I will haunt you for forever and be totally mean. Favorite mug? I'mma break it with my ghost powers after you pour your favorite drink. Want ghost shit all over your bed? No murder! 

Texting, emailing, phone calls, hanging out, yes.

I'm okay with sending pictures of myself and not a bot. 

If you're still reading, fuck yeah. Also, if I'm not what you're looking for, I hope you find some awesome friends.

It's officially my weekend. I don't plan on/want to do anything tonight/tomorrow(Friday) other than relax at home and maybe have a good conversation. If that's all it is, that's cool. If it leads to friendship or beyond, that's even better.

I'm looking for a cool straight male that is fit, single and wanting to go out and meet woman once in a while. I do well by myself but find it better sometimes when I have a wingman that knows how to work the ladies. I'm single, fit, healthy and going back to the old school way of meeting those little princesses which is off-line and get in their face with a smile and attitude. There are a lot of woman in Denver and I'm hoping to find a cool wingman that can help each other with the cause. I prefer a guy that is in their 30's or 40's but younger older is fine if you have game. I'll look forward to hearing from you.
