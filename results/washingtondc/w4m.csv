I'm a DWF looking for love, but who enjoys casual friendships even if they don't turn serious. When Mr. Right comes along, that'll be cool. 

I'm 5'7"", with light brown, shoulder-length hair, blue eyes, and a playful smile. I'm not an athlete, so if you need your woman to be very fit, pass me by. I do work out, and many fellas find my curves attractive. I'm not round!

I like to do the normal fun things, blah blah blah. I speak (passably) a few languages, have a couple of degrees, and lean to the left, socially. I don't smoke, and don't eat animals. 

It makes a difference when you can formulate thoughts and put them in good shape into writing. Please be SINGLE or at least separated for good, and the type to treat people courteously, even (especially) if they are serving you or waiting on you. In other words, be kind, never arrogant, and please have a sense of humor. Be taller than I am, and have time for fun. Workaholics need not apply. Been there, done that. 

If you reply, please consider sending a photo. It's one small safety measure for me, at least it feels like one! Change the subject line. Please be in your 50s or up to mid-60s. Good luck to us both. :)

Please be out there! I never want to post here again. Just not sure where else to try. I'm not the bar type.

Hello Craigslist world, I am somewhat new to this idea, been browsing the ads and haven't seen even a speck of what I'm looking for..maybe someone will read my ad instead and I'll find something that way.. I'm looking for a good looking white married man to share some intimate time with every now and then, not interested in a relationship with anyone, not here for drama or STDs, wanting married so I know your not getting any stray pussy on the side, just want one friend. Want someone with all their teeth, somewhat fit and taller.. Pics go to the front of the line but since u are married, it's not required at first. Will let u know more about me later, but u won't be disappointed. U also must host

Me too! Tired of the bar scene? Me too!! Rather be spending a Saturday evening with a significant other watching T.V, cooking dinner, catching a movie, going to dinner or any of the other mundane things that couples do??? Me too!!!

I went through a breakup last year and took some time to heal and find myself again. I needed to find my happy place again, which I have. I am ready to finally date again. With every breakup you lose a little hope and optimism about love and life. I certainly did but being the eternal romantic I am hopeful that there is someone out there that wants the same things out of life as I do. I have definitely traded in my club nights for a more tame evening at home watching movies and cooking dinner with friends and family. Being at the hottest bars and clubs no longer hold any appeal for me. I am looking for the same in a partner. Someone who wants to spend quiet evening in and just be a couple. :-)

I'm 34 and looking for someone between the ages of 33 and 42. Being able to relate to someone is key in any sort of relationship. If you have kids I am okay with that. If you have a beard I am also okay with that. If you have a man bun.....why??? I am attracted to Caucasian males. I hope you understand that this is a preference and not a prejudice. All I ask you is be funny, witty, open and kind. I definitely bring the same to the table. I even have Kik so we can chat away.

Looking for a different type of relationship with someone who views life completely different than most people and who isn't ashamed of it. (Seeking my Clyde) Someone who isn't afraid to do what it takes to keep his female happy because I would do the same. Regardless of what it is or how risky.

Ok, so here's the skinny...

What I want: I'm seeking an intelligent, AA mature man with a GREAT sense of humor...sane and loves to travel. I am not necessarily looking for a monogamous relationship, BUT you MUST be single. You should be friendly, drug, drama free....positive and upbeat with the ability to be energetic or laid back. Oh and um...gainfully employed or even a career...yeah..that'd be nice. Tall is a huge plus..for me..that would be anyone over 5'8..lol..I'll tell you why in a sec...

Me: I'm an attractive, 5 foot tall (now you get it?), 145 pound, humorous, intelligent and mature AA woman. I have an annoyingly youthful face, but I just turned 45. I live in the MD area. I am from the Midwest and have almost no friends here. I've been here for 4 years and the only reason I stayed is because I met someone I thought I would spend the rest of my life with...well...I was wrong. But its okay. Learned a lot, moving on. I live alone, have a car...I'm not a clubber, rarely drink, don't smoke, GREAT cook (especially soul food) and LOVE to travel. Love animals, hate insects and am turned off by liars, overly defensive men and disrespect. I'm very feminine, but extremely down to earth and forthcoming.

I just want someone to chat with on the daily, hang out with, laugh, eat, movies, travel, so forth. Someone I vibe well with. Ideally...a dominant man that appreciates a feminine and submissive woman...once trust is built...would be a great fit.

I will happily provide pic for pic if my interest in piqued.

Hello!

While I realize a list of attributes doesn't give off an open-minded type of person, I also know from past experiences people I am more likely to bond with. So while I'm not bound fast to these ideals, here are some things I strongly prefer: college education, non-smoker, social drinker, not previously divorced, no children but wants them one day, somewhere in your 30s, not allergic to pets, has a car, no criminal history (okay, maybe a speeding ticket!) honest, and affectionate. Oh, and blue eyes are helpful :-)

A bit about me- graduate degree, teacher, non-smoker, enjoy traveling, honest to a fault, love pets, lived abroad.

I have pictures to share and expect the same. Tell me about yourself in your response. I won't reply unless you've at least put a little effort in!

This may be a long shot but wanted to try anyway. I find nothing sexier than a gentleman who is a beast in the bedroom. A man who is able to woo me with words and treat me like a lady when we aren't acting like the animals we can be when passion takes over. I am married but am able to get away for escapades during the weekdays. If that time frame doesn't work for you, there's no need to respond. I am ddf and a non smoker and expect the same from you.

Really easy to consider:

I'm 35 and a grrreat matchmaker for personalities and appearances.

I need a first client. You can't go wrong. 

Don't send your photo first if you don't want to. I have several questions and could potentially start the search without your actual face in mind! However, it's recommended you do send by our 2nd correspondence. 

I am also matching for women, so you might end up meeting someone I'm matching for this way, too! 

Does this appeal? Scary at all? I'd love to slowly, successfully grow this service. 

Look forward to your first ""Introduction"" email!

Not looking for something casual and open to a relationship forming.

Things I am looking for in a guy: Single, funny, educated, employed, professional, can laugh at himself and have a good time, a manly man (no overly emotional hipsters please), witty and a good conversationalist. I'm a sucker for a nice looking beard/stubble but not so keen on mustaches. I'm pretty open to race/ethnicity as I have dated men of various backgrounds. Guys between 34-44, this I am pretty firm on. I'm not picky as far as height--there is a guy in my office, an older Hispanic guy who is about 5'4 and super skinny but man is he sexy--it's all in how you carry yourself. 

You must be truly ddf, also no stoners please. I want a guy who respects me and treats me well. Geographically you are located in DC, Takoma Park, Silver Spring, Arlington, perhaps Alexandria and Springfield. 

Things to know about me: I'm single, white, short, fat, medium length brown hair and brown eyes. I have an amazingly sexy phone voice and a cute giggle and laugh. I am successful, educated, professional, adventurous, sexy, fun, kind and passionate. I like to cook, travel, learn about different cultures, read and watch tv/movies. I enjoy going for a walk or a good hike and love to swim.

It has been awhile (over a year) since I have been in a relationship and I miss it, miss having someone to cuddle up to, kiss, care for and do fun things with.

I hope you decide to take a chance and reach out to me, I'm looking forward to talking to you soon! (=

I enjoy conversation on all kinds of topics, both personal and current affairs. I read the paper most everyday for relaxation (yes, I know,....hard to believe it's relaxing) and can disappear into a good book. Travel is always a great adventure even if a simple day trip. Happy to roam the streets of an interesting town.

I like a smart, kind man. I find I want to spend more and more time outdoors in active pursuits or even sitting outside when I stop for a coffee. I love the fresh air and the beauty of nature. Hope you do too. I am not a woman in love with shopping, though I take care of myself. Romance means a lot to me.
I value hard work and a meticulous nature. I listen as much as I talk and I hope you'll have a lot to say. I'm upbeat and believe in the power of positive thinking. I smile easily and often.

Ever wish you had someone to cuddle with? Someone to just hang out with? You know, like those days where you are like, ""well shit, if I were in a relationship they could just come over, snuggle, watch tv, etc. etc."" 

Yeah, that would be nice. Perhaps just stay in bed all day on a Sunday and write it off as a lazy day while we order delivery food and watch TV in bed all day. Rub my hair to make me fall asleep and reach for me in the midnight hours. Have someone to wake up to and fix you breakfast before they head off to work. Yep! I'm THAT girl. 

As for the type of guys I like: I'm really into guys who are intellectual, affectionate and a bit of a nerd. Physically, I like my men taller than 5'10"", and average to a few extra pounds. We all have our preferences and that's what I'm immediately attracted to.

As for me: I'm AA, above average height 5'8"", long legs, brown hair and warm expressive brown eyes, a great smile and above average in attractiveness. I'm quirky, down to earth, smart, love music and outdoor activities.
Not looking for drama as I'm direct and straightforward so I'd appreciate someone similar. 
Someone to share in passionate conversations where we are both challenged, laugh, flirt and ultimately devour each other as we are caught up in the passion of the moment. Call it whatever -- a part-time boyfriend, friends w/ benefits, emotional affair or simply a spring fling. 

Send a reply with your age, photo and a bit about yourself. Please be age appropriate 33-45, and interested in something real as I don't want a pen pal or text buddy. I'm looking to meet this weekend if you're available. I could really use a good snuggle right now.

Your picture get's my pic.

I'm looking for someone to take care of me. Period.
About me:
I'm smart,
I'm drama free,
I'm open to trying new things within reason,
I can carry good conversations, Im a good listener. 
I'm not a party on the sence kind of person. I'm more on the homebody type. I do have a kid and Im a single mom. (my kid is awesome btw)
I'm honest, and very loyal.
Std and mostly drug free (i smoke weed, not a lot but I do smoke here and there) * only drink socially.
Im fat, not disgusting its belly fat (let's just say I get asked how far along I am), I am very pretty though. People say to me all the time of only you would loose your belly you'd be hot. I need some one to work me out, and make me want to stick to a diet. I need encouragment and rewards.
I work, I can take care of myself and my kid however sometimes I feel so overwhelmed I need a little extra money to ensure my kid has what they need.

I've always been the ""ride or die"" type chick and I'm over it. I need someone to take care of me financially. 
I want gifts and dates and real conversations.

All in all I need a man who is established and can take care of me and my kid if I was to loose my job tomorrow with out question. 

Im asking for a lot right? 
Well I'm worth it, trust me if you take care of me I take care of you. I'm fun, Im nasty, Im what you need I'm a bed room. It sounds bad once you say it all aloud but hey it is Craigslist.

Email me. Please be real.

Intelligence is a huge turn-on! You don't need to have a PhD, but I do value intellectual conversations, and want to find someone who does as well. I love music. I love to laugh. I love to read. I love to be outdoors- hiking, camping, a day at the beach . I am honest, loving, caring, affectionate, articulate, patient. I am just searching for a needle in the haystack. Are you out there?

If you are recently out of a relationship and are not sure if you are ready to date, please move on. I don't want to be your rebound girl. I am emotionally healthy and actually looking for someone who is the same. I'm attracted to men who are taller than me, I'm 5'9"", with nice teeth who doesn't do drugs.. A man with a sense of humor and stable position in life. My man should be honest, hard-working and always loyal to me...A friend and a lover...make me laugh, no drama, jealousy, cheating or head games. He has to understand and support me in my daily life... At the same time i will do my best to show him my love, friendship and to make his life full of happiness!

Do you know some of the teachings of Louise L. Hay, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Dolores Cannon, Doreen Virtue, Eckhart Tolle, and Gregg Braden? 

Have you been gathering knowledge and experiences in the fields of spirituality, mind expansion, parallel realities, self-reflection etc.? 

Have you ever played around with tarot cards, pendulums, meditation, and the like? 

Are you able to see through the mission of mainstream media, and have therefore quit watching TV? 

Do you focus your life on peace, love, and harmony? 

Have you given up nagging and judging, because you realized that you attract negative energies by not giving them up? 

Have you made sense of events in your past by learning the lesson and moving on? 

Do you stay away from electro smog the best way you can? 

Do you stay away from large crowds of people?

Have you quit a job that required being brainwashed, in order to declutter/simplify your life? 

Have you been re-evaluating old beliefs a lot during the last few years?

Can you read people's energies? Do you know if somebody is in integrity without them having said one single word? 

If your answers to the above are ""yes"", you and I definitely have a lot in common. Please send me an email, and let's talk. I am looking for a spiritual partner who has knowledge and experience in spiritual fields as mentioned above.

Hello

I'm ISO in search of someone to date and possibly an LTR if it's right. 

ME: I'm 43 single and no Children/non smoker. I am not a skinny blond model type and I do not wear fancy clothes to work . I am your typical down to earth good woman. I am a year round Camp director so I like to play outside, go camping, go fishing . 

I love going to see live bands, talking about music and art, going out dancing, and movies etc.
I've lived in over 13 different states. I do love to travel but only by car and by train (if I can help it). 
I am a resident artist in Washington, DC and I book shows for local bands.

Never give up on finding your dream woman. She's out there looking for you! Love is life's greatest gift. Bonus points if you like Godiva, Lindt, Ferrero Rocher, Hershey's Kisses, and M&M's. But you also like carrots, avocados, apples, quinoa, and try to eat healthy. Pizza should have its own food group on the pyramid. But then again, you like kale, oatmeal, brown rice......yes.

Hi! I am good hearted country girl looking for a real man for friendship that ideally would lead to a long term relationship.

A little about me: Animals are a HUGE part of my life, I have horses and they are my furry children. Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my friends, animals, sewing & trying my skills with other craft type things, bonfires, target shooting, fishing, competing with my horses at local events, anything outdoors really. I have a good sense of humor & love to laugh. I'm not a big partier or club goer, but I like to get out & enjoy life. I'm told that I am loving, extremely honest, fiercely loyal, sarcastic & hard headed. I am a farm girl, and not afraid of mud and getting dirty, but I have a girly side. I have a great group of close friends that I love dearly and am very close with. I am very honest & up front, and have no patience for games, lies or bs. I joke a lot & try not to take life more seriously than needed. Though I try to keep myself busy, I am a firm believer in making time for that special guy in my life. And, I'm a bigger/thick girl, just fyi if that is an issue for you..... I deal with 2,000 lb horses, so I'm not a weak or lazy girl LOL.

The type of guy I'm looking for is HONEST, caring, loyal/faithful, no drama/games/bs, hard working, a gentleman and FUNNY! If you can't joke around we won't get along. I am not at all interested in friends with benefits, random hookups or meaningless flings. I am looking for a relationship. Obviously relationships take time & chemistry, but in a perfect world I would like to find ""the one"". Liking animals earns you HUGE bonus points. No druggies, criminals or thug types. And sorry, I'm only attracted to white guys and around my own age (around 30-40 years old). Just what I like, don't read more into it. I just want a good guy that I enjoy being around. Is that too much to ask?

Please email me with the subject ""hello"" so I know it's not spam (and that you actually read this lol). Please include info about yourself & a pic.... a nice pic, not a dirty pic, I'm a woman not a skank. Good luck to everyone out there, I hope you find the 1.

Hey there! 

Happy Monday :) How's it going? I am looking for a nice, down to earth guy who is a little bit country /a little city! I want someone to laugh with, travel with, and be best friends with. I like to read, go to sporting events, movies, go kayaking (really anything on the water) and am looking for a loyal, nice guy who really believes in living a life of integrity. I love to go for pancakes on the weekend and probably more of a homebody than a night owl. Just being honest.

I am totally open to you having kids. I live on the orange line in NoVA and looking to date someone along the orange/silver/ blue lines or in DC. I am not a smoker, drinker only socially on occasion and seek the same. To each his own, but if you are super liberal, I'm probably not the girl for you.

Did I mention nice, loyal, easy going and a person of integrity is important? Good, because to me, it is. 

Besides that I have lots of interests but you'll need to ask to learn more.

Your picture gets mine. Oh yeah - I have a good job, have a graduate degree, and love my family & friends.

SBF, curvy with a few extra pounds, searching for a man to get to know and develop into a relationship. I have HSV (that's ""herpes,"" for those of you too lazy to Google it. You either have it or know what it is and it doesn't trip you out. Am not interested in anyone who casually dates or who is looking for fwb, nsa or anything similar. Married and separated men aren't welcome (your unhappiness in your marriage is not my issue...).

About me...I'm not into pretty words for the sake of pretty words. Come at me like an adult and be real with your intentions to me...or don't come to me at all. You haven't even met me...don't talk about if we were married. You don't even remember how to spell my name...don't tell me you love me. Get to know me and show me you are real about me before you go trying to claim something that isn't yours to claim. I like romance, I like passion. But you need to show me who you are first.

You're between 28 and 42, completely single, nonsmoker, average/stocky/husky/few extra pounds build (prefer average to few extra pounds), funny and fun to be around and give good massages and hugs (I do as well) that don't always lead to you trying to inappropriately cop a feel. You also hate dating as much as I do, want to get married oneday sooner rather than within the next decade, and want children. You're not super serious, but mature enough to deal with rough times as an adult in an adult relationship. You'll know how to (and love making) me laugh, and maybe you have a heart for something greater than yourself. You're a non-smoker...You don't do 420, are not quitting or vaping or looking for the woman to make you quit (that's bullshit, btw). You're single...no 8 month separation or divorce pending or open relationship or gf on a break. You like to cook (Chef Boyardee is not food...), like dogs (but not a crazy pet person), zombie games and action movies are a plus, and good hugs (I'm repeating what's truly important). Me...I cook and bake (sometimes), love dogs, play certain video games, love action movies, word games, all kinds of music, blah blah blah.

I'm getting a lot of responses from frat boy/pretty boy types that I'm not even going to respond to (sorry...). Nothing against frat boys or pretty boys, or guys who describe themselves so openly as ""attractive"" or ""easy on the eyes""...but seriously, did men go around saying this shit 50 years ago, because it just seems so damn weird to me...But seriously now, if you see yourself as being made for the cover of a GQ magazine, and all you have going for you is what you look like and how good (you think) your sex skills are, you're likely as interesting to me as a blonde in a fun house of mirrors and are not who I'm looking for. I don't really want someone who feels the need to brag to me all day, let alone the whole world, of that which they have not even proven...

If your immediate response to my post is something of insult because my words hurt your pride in some way, you're not mature enough (or have enough humor or sarcasm) for my taste.

Am open to men of different races. Am more interested in who you are as a person, but I like what I like as you like what you like when it comes to our preferences. My preferences vary far as what you look like, I won't really know until I know (or until you say something that helps speed that decision along).

Put ""Morning Sunshine"" in subject line so I know you're real. If you just say hi or just ask me for a pic, you're not my type. Pic for pic, by the way. This is a real post, I saw The Hateful Eight yesterday, and my friend and I are in dispute about its meaning (or, in his opinion, its lack thereof). If you've seen it, I'm curious as to your take on it...unless you have no take, or you're a douche...then I can do without.

No seriously Netflix (or Hulu or Amazon) chill and take out? Why don't people do this anymore. Don't get me wrong I love the Netflix and ""chill"" but I don't want just random sex partners anymore. Maybe I'm getting old or maybe I'm just not cool anymore. Anyway a bit about me I'm 28, work a lot so I don't get much time to go out, enjoy Netflix (it's always sunny is my favorite show) I do like going out for dinner once in a while, love all types of music but rock/metal the most. I also don't have many (really any) friends around here so I don't really have anyone to just chill with. I'm more of a rocker chick I have a bunch of tasteful tattoos and a few piercings.

I've been hunting high and low for you! Sorry to have kept you waiting. I've been busy, working on my advanced degree, establishing myself professionally, and becoming the sort of person you might like to meet. 

I love reading, British detective shows, stargazing, road trips, college football, Korean food, hockey, a rainy weekend morning at the museum, outdoor movies in the summer, hiking, Marvel comics, a night at the symphony, a bare knuckles game of Scrabble, proper afternoon tea, rugby, discussing geopolitics, and great hugs. My patriotism is deep, my politics moderate (even in this era of insane incivility). Lately, I've started taken a vegetarian cooking class and learning a little German. While I am somewhat religious, it's not a dealbreaker that you should be.

I enjoy meeting people from all backgrounds, especially those that are smart, kind, and funny. All I ask is that you are truly single and sincere about looking for a relationship. Of course, giving great hugs and smelling great won't hurt. I'm happy to exchange pics but no rush on that if you are shy.

It's Sunday evening. I'm a single black female on cl seeking a single black male.

I have some ish with me that I Know bout myself. Nothing bad. Just typical woman ish. Like. Wanting a man to be of his word. Saying what he means and doing what he says. A true gentleman in every sense of the word. Not just Tuesday, Wednesday, and Sunday. Someone who believes in romance. It doesn't take major bucks to Romance a woman. Someone who can appreciate the just because moments. So my ish may not be welcoming to you and I accept that. I may not be for you. We all have our baggage. Its up to the individual to help store, walk away or put up with said baggage. 


Now not saying you won't get typical woman ish like. Being Indecisive. Hint hint at times wanting a man to be a man. Mood swings. Mostly when Im pmsing or mad at the world or when traffic sucks (DMV Area) or the job has given me the blues. Otherwise than that. I'm a typical girly girl. I don't have a team for nan sport but I watch just about all sports. I don't drink beer but do fart in my sleep but blame the dog...shhh I don't have a dog. I don't take forever getting ready 30 minutes wait no 15 minutes at tops. And yes I cry. I am emotional and I owned my ish! Can you??

A little about me...I'm 28, I'm tall and curvy, I have dark hair and eyes with tan skin. I love watching sports, going to the beach, trying new restaurants, mini road trips, TV shows (both the really bad and the really good) and, my favorite, lazy afternoons spent cuddling with someone that you can't stop thinking about :) I live a pretty stable life...I have a great apartment and work at a job that I like that lets me keep pretty normal business hours and prefer to find someone with ambition but who still has time for a relationship (there are a lot of workaholics in this city).

I guess if any of this sounds interesting and you think we'd get along, shoot me an email! I'm hoping to find someone between 27-38 and taller than 6'0 (only because I'm tall as well). I hope to hear from you soon!

Fit, fun, feisty (and flawed, too) professional gal ISO compatible companion for adventures in life, love, and learning. . ..really longing for love again.

About you. You're an active, smart, fit, present, patient, engaged and engaging non player in the 49-56 year old age range. You're 5'9+, well groomed, and know how to treat a woman. You are conversant, compassionate, kind, and healthy in body, mind and sprit. You've got a broad world view, a spirit of openness, and are eager to meet a decent woman. Ideally, one of your greatest virtues is patience.

Me? I'm a petite, blue eyed brunette with boundless energy, a ready smile, and an open heart. Often hear that I look good. Avid hiker who particularly enjoys many of life's simpler pleasures, among them daily exercise, healthy living, children, animals, laughter, the arts, good food, good conversation, lotsa lovemaking with the right one (very important), more laughter. I'm slightly alternative with a preference for the road less travelled. Strong connection to nature, so daily walking has been critical to my well being. I lead an active, sometimes colorful life, always guided by a strong moral compass. Traditional values, monogamy, kindness and integrity are at my core, and at yours as well. If we are compatible, we have a good time no matter what we do together. I'm not a fit with most and discerning about who I do spend time with. 
Still hopeful that you're out there. 
Are you?

If any of this resonates with you, I'd love to hear from you with a non generic reply (no pics please - still enjoy the element of surprise). Preference is to speak by phone fairly early on- we'll know rather quickly if we'd like to meet. As a traditionalist, prefer good old fashioned person to person contact vs. a text, phone or e-mail buddy. Thanks.

Peace

Hi! I am good hearted country girl looking for a real man for friendship that ideally would lead to a long term relationship.

A little about me: Animals are a HUGE part of my life, I have horses and they are my furry children. Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my friends, animals, sewing & trying my skills with other craft type things, bonfires, target shooting, fishing, competing with my horses at local events, anything outdoors really. I have a good sense of humor & love to laugh. I'm not a big partier or club goer, but I like to get out & enjoy life. I'm told that I am loving, extremely honest, fiercely loyal, sarcastic & hard headed. I am a farm girl, and not afraid of mud and getting dirty, but I have a girly side. I have a great group of close friends that I love dearly and am very close with. I am very honest & up front, and have no patience for games, lies or bs. I joke a lot & try not to take life more seriously than needed. Though I try to keep myself busy, I am a firm believer in making time for that special guy in my life. And, I'm a bigger/thick girl, just fyi if that is an issue for you..... I deal with 2,000 lb horses, so I'm not a weak or lazy girl LOL.

The type of guy I'm looking for is HONEST, caring, loyal/faithful, no drama/games/bs, hard working, a gentleman and FUNNY! If you can't joke around we won't get along. I am not at all interested in friends with benefits, random hookups or meaningless flings. I am looking for a relationship. Obviously relationships take time & chemistry, but in a perfect world I would like to find ""the one"". Liking animals earns you HUGE bonus points. No druggies, criminals or thug types. And sorry, I'm only attracted to white guys and around my own age (around 30-40 years old). Just what I like, don't read more into it. I just want a good guy that I enjoy being around. Is that too much to ask?

Please email me with the subject ""hello"" so I know it's not spam (and that you actually read this lol). Please include info about yourself & a pic.... a nice pic, not a dirty pic, I'm a woman not a skank. Good luck to everyone out there, I hope you find the 1.

So, I work in marketing/advertising/PR. I have to watch focus groups for 5 hours tonight (6-11) you heard me.

Anyone up for some witty banter during that time? Well, let's be honest, after my 3rd glass of wine and 900pm rolls around, the banter will just be me bitchy about stupidness.

About me (so you can direct your questions accordingly). I am divorced (relatively recently). I am 34. I am happy.

I am in great great great shape. I am a [solidcore] fiend. I'm tall (sorry) 5'7 and do keep it very toned. But I also love to eat out and travel. I love new experiences and trying different things. I am incredibly open minded and tolerant of everyone.

I love going to the theater and concerts and have many subscriptions. I love getting dressed up. But don't mind a night at home for some board games and wine.

Basically, if I'm going out, I like to do something a tad more adult. But if I'm staying in, it's PJs, board games and going to bed early.

If you want to know anything else, just ask. I'm pretty easy to speak with. If I don't get to your response and it is good, there's a pretty good chance I get to it tomorrow (as i'll be a zombie and my boss isn't in the office).

looking for a guy that is non judgmental, humble and open to helping a woman get back on her feet. Don't want to play any games or spark any illusions. I intend to be straight up with you and i expect the same in return. That's how true friendship is developed, maintained and endured. 

You can sit around chasing these post and browsing these fictitious ads all day. you will be re-directed to a web site or porn site. Im real and im coming to you on some real life terms. Looking for a good guy that has a heart and a great soul.

talk more when i receive you message,

this isnt for everyone and Im hoping you realize the opportunity this may be for us both

You've been searching this site for months, some of you Ive seen your screen names for years. Its down right ridiculous that you find yourself still play around on here. Have you ever once got you some good stuff from one of these females???

Have you ever had a date that lasted longer than 10 minutes with someone you met on this site. Its time to change your strategy guys, you're wasting your time. 

I know it feels good to become your alter ego behind the keyboard and screen. Probably really turns you on to act as if you are confident and secure about yourself when in reality you hate yourself and everything about your life. Im just saying what someone should have told you long time ago. Well, im sure many of your parents probably told you once or twice that you wasn't shit and would never be shit. Its more than likely the reason you are abusive to animals and cant get a woman to smile at you ever.

Well hopefully i brightened your day and if you feel the need to reply, I welcome it you need it and maybe we can make some satisfactory changes in your persona because you are losing the way you do things

Salutations!

I'm an attached, voluptuous, medium height, educated black woman, early 30s, looking for stimulating conversation with a mature man. Intelligence is the most attractive thing about a man, not just book smarts but wisdom and emotional intelligence as well. I can't promise anything physical but if you like large lactating breasts, that's something you might experience at a later date. 

I prefer a brown-skinned man who is 5'10"" or taller, with normal to muscular build, but if you can deliver on the conversation, I might be slightly more open-minded. Please note that I am a bit of a liberal/activist type and probably wouldn't get along well with a conservative or particularly religious individual.

Please respond with your favorite woman author, or book written by a woman, and a very brief summary of why you like her/it. 

Thank you.

Have you ever played around with tarot cards, pendulums, meditation, and the like? 

Are you able to see through the mission of mainstream media, and have therefore quit watching TV? 

Do you focus your life on peace, love, and harmony? 

Have you given up nagging and judging, because you realized that you attract negative energies by not giving them up? 

Have you made sense of events in your past by learning the lesson and moving on? 

Do you stay away from electro smog the best way you can? 

Do you stay away from large crowds of people?

Have you quit a job that required being brainwashed, in order to declutter/simplify your life? 

Have you been re-evaluating old beliefs a lot during the last few years?

Can you read people's energies? Do you know if somebody is in integrity without them having said one single word? 

If your answers to the above are ""yes"", you and I definitely have a lot in common. Please send me an email, and let's talk. I am looking for friends (and possibly my soulmate) who I can have exchanges with about what we're currently experiencing on this planet.
