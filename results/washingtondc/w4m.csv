I'm a DWF looking for love, but who enjoys casual friendships even if they don't turn serious. When Mr. Right comes along, that'll be cool. 

I'm 5'7"", with light brown, shoulder-length hair, blue eyes, and a playful smile. I'm not an athlete, so if you need your woman to be very fit, pass me by. I do work out, and many fellas find my curves attractive. I'm not round!

I like to do the normal fun things, blah blah blah. I speak (passably) a few languages, have a couple of degrees, and lean to the left, socially. I don't smoke, and don't eat animals. 

It makes a difference when you can formulate thoughts and put them in good shape into writing. Please be SINGLE or at least separated for good, and the type to treat people courteously, even (especially) if they are serving you or waiting on you. In other words, be kind, never arrogant, and please have a sense of humor. Be taller than I am, and have time for fun. Workaholics need not apply. Been there, done that. 

If you reply, please consider sending a photo. It's one small safety measure for me, at least it feels like one! Change the subject line. Please be in your 50s or up to mid-60s. Good luck to us both. :)

Please be out there! I never want to post here again. Just not sure where else to try. I'm not the bar type.

Hello Craigslist world, I am somewhat new to this idea, been browsing the ads and haven't seen even a speck of what I'm looking for..maybe someone will read my ad instead and I'll find something that way.. I'm looking for a good looking white married man to share some intimate time with every now and then, not interested in a relationship with anyone, not here for drama or STDs, wanting married so I know your not getting any stray pussy on the side, just want one friend. Want someone with all their teeth, somewhat fit and taller.. Pics go to the front of the line but since u are married, it's not required at first. Will let u know more about me later, but u won't be disappointed. U also must host

Me too! Tired of the bar scene? Me too!! Rather be spending a Saturday evening with a significant other watching T.V, cooking dinner, catching a movie, going to dinner or any of the other mundane things that couples do??? Me too!!!

I went through a breakup last year and took some time to heal and find myself again. I needed to find my happy place again, which I have. I am ready to finally date again. With every breakup you lose a little hope and optimism about love and life. I certainly did but being the eternal romantic I am hopeful that there is someone out there that wants the same things out of life as I do. I have definitely traded in my club nights for a more tame evening at home watching movies and cooking dinner with friends and family. Being at the hottest bars and clubs no longer hold any appeal for me. I am looking for the same in a partner. Someone who wants to spend quiet evening in and just be a couple. :-)

I'm 34 and looking for someone between the ages of 33 and 42. Being able to relate to someone is key in any sort of relationship. If you have kids I am okay with that. If you have a beard I am also okay with that. If you have a man bun.....why??? I am attracted to Caucasian males. I hope you understand that this is a preference and not a prejudice. All I ask you is be funny, witty, open and kind. I definitely bring the same to the table. I even have Kik so we can chat away.

Looking for a different type of relationship with someone who views life completely different than most people and who isn't ashamed of it. (Seeking my Clyde) Someone who isn't afraid to do what it takes to keep his female happy because I would do the same. Regardless of what it is or how risky.

Ok, so here's the skinny...

What I want: I'm seeking an intelligent, AA mature man with a GREAT sense of humor...sane and loves to travel. I am not necessarily looking for a monogamous relationship, BUT you MUST be single. You should be friendly, drug, drama free....positive and upbeat with the ability to be energetic or laid back. Oh and um...gainfully employed or even a career...yeah..that'd be nice. Tall is a huge plus..for me..that would be anyone over 5'8..lol..I'll tell you why in a sec...

Me: I'm an attractive, 5 foot tall (now you get it?), 145 pound, humorous, intelligent and mature AA woman. I have an annoyingly youthful face, but I just turned 45. I live in the MD area. I am from the Midwest and have almost no friends here. I've been here for 4 years and the only reason I stayed is because I met someone I thought I would spend the rest of my life with...well...I was wrong. But its okay. Learned a lot, moving on. I live alone, have a car...I'm not a clubber, rarely drink, don't smoke, GREAT cook (especially soul food) and LOVE to travel. Love animals, hate insects and am turned off by liars, overly defensive men and disrespect. I'm very feminine, but extremely down to earth and forthcoming.

I just want someone to chat with on the daily, hang out with, laugh, eat, movies, travel, so forth. Someone I vibe well with. Ideally...a dominant man that appreciates a feminine and submissive woman...once trust is built...would be a great fit.

I will happily provide pic for pic if my interest in piqued.

Hello!

While I realize a list of attributes doesn't give off an open-minded type of person, I also know from past experiences people I am more likely to bond with. So while I'm not bound fast to these ideals, here are some things I strongly prefer: college education, non-smoker, social drinker, not previously divorced, no children but wants them one day, somewhere in your 30s, not allergic to pets, has a car, no criminal history (okay, maybe a speeding ticket!) honest, and affectionate. Oh, and blue eyes are helpful :-)

A bit about me- graduate degree, teacher, non-smoker, enjoy traveling, honest to a fault, love pets, lived abroad.

I have pictures to share and expect the same. Tell me about yourself in your response. I won't reply unless you've at least put a little effort in!

This may be a long shot but wanted to try anyway. I find nothing sexier than a gentleman who is a beast in the bedroom. A man who is able to woo me with words and treat me like a lady when we aren't acting like the animals we can be when passion takes over. I am married but am able to get away for escapades during the weekdays. If that time frame doesn't work for you, there's no need to respond. I am ddf and a non smoker and expect the same from you.

Really easy to consider:

I'm 35 and a grrreat matchmaker for personalities and appearances.

I need a first client. You can't go wrong. 

Don't send your photo first if you don't want to. I have several questions and could potentially start the search without your actual face in mind! However, it's recommended you do send by our 2nd correspondence. 

I am also matching for women, so you might end up meeting someone I'm matching for this way, too! 

Does this appeal? Scary at all? I'd love to slowly, successfully grow this service. 

Look forward to your first ""Introduction"" email!

Not looking for something casual and open to a relationship forming.

Things I am looking for in a guy: Single, funny, educated, employed, professional, can laugh at himself and have a good time, a manly man (no overly emotional hipsters please), witty and a good conversationalist. I'm a sucker for a nice looking beard/stubble but not so keen on mustaches. I'm pretty open to race/ethnicity as I have dated men of various backgrounds. Guys between 34-44, this I am pretty firm on. I'm not picky as far as height--there is a guy in my office, an older Hispanic guy who is about 5'4 and super skinny but man is he sexy--it's all in how you carry yourself. 

You must be truly ddf, also no stoners please. I want a guy who respects me and treats me well. Geographically you are located in DC, Takoma Park, Silver Spring, Arlington, perhaps Alexandria and Springfield. 

Things to know about me: I'm single, white, short, fat, medium length brown hair and brown eyes. I have an amazingly sexy phone voice and a cute giggle and laugh. I am successful, educated, professional, adventurous, sexy, fun, kind and passionate. I like to cook, travel, learn about different cultures, read and watch tv/movies. I enjoy going for a walk or a good hike and love to swim.

It has been awhile (over a year) since I have been in a relationship and I miss it, miss having someone to cuddle up to, kiss, care for and do fun things with.

I hope you decide to take a chance and reach out to me, I'm looking forward to talking to you soon! (=

I enjoy conversation on all kinds of topics, both personal and current affairs. I read the paper most everyday for relaxation (yes, I know,....hard to believe it's relaxing) and can disappear into a good book. Travel is always a great adventure even if a simple day trip. Happy to roam the streets of an interesting town.

I like a smart, kind man. I find I want to spend more and more time outdoors in active pursuits or even sitting outside when I stop for a coffee. I love the fresh air and the beauty of nature. Hope you do too. I am not a woman in love with shopping, though I take care of myself. Romance means a lot to me.
I value hard work and a meticulous nature. I listen as much as I talk and I hope you'll have a lot to say. I'm upbeat and believe in the power of positive thinking. I smile easily and often.

Ever wish you had someone to cuddle with? Someone to just hang out with? You know, like those days where you are like, ""well shit, if I were in a relationship they could just come over, snuggle, watch tv, etc. etc."" 

Yeah, that would be nice. Perhaps just stay in bed all day on a Sunday and write it off as a lazy day while we order delivery food and watch TV in bed all day. Rub my hair to make me fall asleep and reach for me in the midnight hours. Have someone to wake up to and fix you breakfast before they head off to work. Yep! I'm THAT girl. 

As for the type of guys I like: I'm really into guys who are intellectual, affectionate and a bit of a nerd. Physically, I like my men taller than 5'10"", and average to a few extra pounds. We all have our preferences and that's what I'm immediately attracted to.

As for me: I'm AA, above average height 5'8"", long legs, brown hair and warm expressive brown eyes, a great smile and above average in attractiveness. I'm quirky, down to earth, smart, love music and outdoor activities.
Not looking for drama as I'm direct and straightforward so I'd appreciate someone similar. 
Someone to share in passionate conversations where we are both challenged, laugh, flirt and ultimately devour each other as we are caught up in the passion of the moment. Call it whatever -- a part-time boyfriend, friends w/ benefits, emotional affair or simply a spring fling. 

Send a reply with your age, photo and a bit about yourself. Please be age appropriate 33-45, and interested in something real as I don't want a pen pal or text buddy. I'm looking to meet this weekend if you're available. I could really use a good snuggle right now.

Your picture get's my pic.

I'm looking for someone to take care of me. Period.
About me:
I'm smart,
I'm drama free,
I'm open to trying new things within reason,
I can carry good conversations, Im a good listener. 
I'm not a party on the sence kind of person. I'm more on the homebody type. I do have a kid and Im a single mom. (my kid is awesome btw)
I'm honest, and very loyal.
Std and mostly drug free (i smoke weed, not a lot but I do smoke here and there) * only drink socially.
Im fat, not disgusting its belly fat (let's just say I get asked how far along I am), I am very pretty though. People say to me all the time of only you would loose your belly you'd be hot. I need some one to work me out, and make me want to stick to a diet. I need encouragment and rewards.
I work, I can take care of myself and my kid however sometimes I feel so overwhelmed I need a little extra money to ensure my kid has what they need.

I've always been the ""ride or die"" type chick and I'm over it. I need someone to take care of me financially. 
I want gifts and dates and real conversations.

All in all I need a man who is established and can take care of me and my kid if I was to loose my job tomorrow with out question. 

Im asking for a lot right? 
Well I'm worth it, trust me if you take care of me I take care of you. I'm fun, Im nasty, Im what you need I'm a bed room. It sounds bad once you say it all aloud but hey it is Craigslist.

Email me. Please be real.

Intelligence is a huge turn-on! You don't need to have a PhD, but I do value intellectual conversations, and want to find someone who does as well. I love music. I love to laugh. I love to read. I love to be outdoors- hiking, camping, a day at the beach . I am honest, loving, caring, affectionate, articulate, patient. I am just searching for a needle in the haystack. Are you out there?

If you are recently out of a relationship and are not sure if you are ready to date, please move on. I don't want to be your rebound girl. I am emotionally healthy and actually looking for someone who is the same. I'm attracted to men who are taller than me, I'm 5'9"", with nice teeth who doesn't do drugs.. A man with a sense of humor and stable position in life. My man should be honest, hard-working and always loyal to me...A friend and a lover...make me laugh, no drama, jealousy, cheating or head games. He has to understand and support me in my daily life... At the same time i will do my best to show him my love, friendship and to make his life full of happiness!

I am looking for a friend/date/boyfriend who is single and looking to get to know a smart lady. I don't do drugs, smoke or drink.

Do you know some of the teachings of Louise L. Hay, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Dolores Cannon, Doreen Virtue, Eckhart Tolle, and Gregg Braden? 

Have you been gathering knowledge and experiences in the fields of spirituality, mind expansion, parallel realities, self-reflection etc.? 

Have you ever played around with tarot cards, pendulums, meditation, and the like? 

Are you able to see through the mission of mainstream media, and have therefore quit watching TV? 

Do you focus your life on peace, love, and harmony? 

Have you given up nagging and judging, because you realized that you attract negative energies by not giving them up? 

Have you made sense of events in your past by learning the lesson and moving on? 

Do you stay away from electro smog the best way you can? 

Do you stay away from large crowds of people?

Have you quit a job that required being brainwashed, in order to declutter/simplify your life? 

Have you been re-evaluating old beliefs a lot during the last few years?

Can you read people's energies? Do you know if somebody is in integrity without them having said one single word? 

If your answers to the above are ""yes"", you and I definitely have a lot in common. Please send me an email, and let's talk. I am looking for a spiritual partner who has knowledge and experience in spiritual fields as mentioned above.

Hello

I'm ISO in search of someone to date and possibly an LTR if it's right. 

ME: I'm 43 single and no Children/non smoker. I am not a skinny blond model type and I do not wear fancy clothes to work . I am your typical down to earth good woman. I am a year round Camp director so I like to play outside, go camping, go fishing . 

I love going to see live bands, talking about music and art, going out dancing, and movies etc.
I've lived in over 13 different states. I do love to travel but only by car and by train (if I can help it). 
I am a resident artist in Washington, DC and I book shows for local bands. 

You: over 40 , not married non smoker. Lives Local 

Picture for a response ONLY. I WILL NOT respond without a picture and if you aren't local.

Never give up on finding your dream woman. She's out there looking for you! Love is life's greatest gift. Bonus points if you like Godiva, Lindt, Ferrero Rocher, Hershey's Kisses, and M&M's. But you also like carrots, avocados, apples, quinoa, and try to eat healthy. Pizza should have its own food group on the pyramid. But then again, you like kale, oatmeal, brown rice......yes.

Hi! I am good hearted country girl looking for a real man for friendship that ideally would lead to a long term relationship.

A little about me: Animals are a HUGE part of my life, I have horses and they are my furry children. Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my friends, animals, sewing & trying my skills with other craft type things, bonfires, target shooting, fishing, competing with my horses at local events, anything outdoors really. I have a good sense of humor & love to laugh. I'm not a big partier or club goer, but I like to get out & enjoy life. I'm told that I am loving, extremely honest, fiercely loyal, sarcastic & hard headed. I am a farm girl, and not afraid of mud and getting dirty, but I have a girly side. I have a great group of close friends that I love dearly and am very close with. I am very honest & up front, and have no patience for games, lies or bs. I joke a lot & try not to take life more seriously than needed. Though I try to keep myself busy, I am a firm believer in making time for that special guy in my life. And, I'm a bigger/thick girl, just fyi if that is an issue for you..... I deal with 2,000 lb horses, so I'm not a weak or lazy girl LOL.

The type of guy I'm looking for is HONEST, caring, loyal/faithful, no drama/games/bs, hard working, a gentleman and FUNNY! If you can't joke around we won't get along. I am not at all interested in friends with benefits, random hookups or meaningless flings. I am looking for a relationship. Obviously relationships take time & chemistry, but in a perfect world I would like to find ""the one"". Liking animals earns you HUGE bonus points. No druggies, criminals or thug types. And sorry, I'm only attracted to white guys and around my own age (around 30-40 years old). Just what I like, don't read more into it. I just want a good guy that I enjoy being around. Is that too much to ask?

Please email me with the subject ""hello"" so I know it's not spam (and that you actually read this lol). Please include info about yourself & a pic.... a nice pic, not a dirty pic, I'm a woman not a skank. Good luck to everyone out there, I hope you find the 1.

Hey there! 

Happy Monday :) How's it going? I am looking for a nice, down to earth guy who is a little bit country /a little city! I want someone to laugh with, travel with, and be best friends with. I like to read, go to sporting events, movies, go kayaking (really anything on the water) and am looking for a loyal, nice guy who really believes in living a life of integrity. I love to go for pancakes on the weekend and probably more of a homebody than a night owl. Just being honest.

I am totally open to you having kids. I live on the orange line in NoVA and looking to date someone along the orange/silver/ blue lines or in DC. I am not a smoker, drinker only socially on occasion and seek the same. To each his own, but if you are super liberal, I'm probably not the girl for you.

Did I mention nice, loyal, easy going and a person of integrity is important? Good, because to me, it is. 

Besides that I have lots of interests but you'll need to ask to learn more.

Your picture gets mine. Oh yeah - I have a good job, have a graduate degree, and love my family & friends.

SBF, curvy with a few extra pounds, searching for a man to get to know and develop into a relationship. I have HSV (that's ""herpes,"" for those of you too lazy to Google it. You either have it or know what it is and it doesn't trip you out. Am not interested in anyone who casually dates or who is looking for fwb, nsa or anything similar. Married and separated men aren't welcome (your unhappiness in your marriage is not my issue...).

About me...I'm not into pretty words for the sake of pretty words. Come at me like an adult and be real with your intentions to me...or don't come to me at all. You haven't even met me...don't talk about if we were married. You don't even remember how to spell my name...don't tell me you love me. Get to know me and show me you are real about me before you go trying to claim something that isn't yours to claim. I like romance, I like passion. But you need to show me who you are first.

You're between 28 and 42, completely single, nonsmoker, average/stocky/husky/few extra pounds build (prefer average to few extra pounds), funny and fun to be around and give good massages and hugs (I do as well) that don't always lead to you trying to inappropriately cop a feel. You also hate dating as much as I do, want to get married oneday sooner rather than within the next decade, and want children. You're not super serious, but mature enough to deal with rough times as an adult in an adult relationship. You'll know how to (and love making) me laugh, and maybe you have a heart for something greater than yourself. You're a non-smoker...You don't do 420, are not quitting or vaping or looking for the woman to make you quit (that's bullshit, btw). You're single...no 8 month separation or divorce pending or open relationship or gf on a break. You like to cook (Chef Boyardee is not food...), like dogs (but not a crazy pet person), zombie games and action movies are a plus, and good hugs (I'm repeating what's truly important). Me...I cook and bake (sometimes), love dogs, play certain video games, love action movies, word games, all kinds of music, blah blah blah.

I'm getting a lot of responses from frat boy/pretty boy types that I'm not even going to respond to (sorry...). Nothing against frat boys or pretty boys, or guys who describe themselves so openly as ""attractive"" or ""easy on the eyes""...but seriously, did men go around saying this shit 50 years ago, because it just seems so damn weird to me...But seriously now, if you see yourself as being made for the cover of a GQ magazine, and all you have going for you is what you look like and how good (you think) your sex skills are, you're likely as interesting to me as a blonde in a fun house of mirrors and are not who I'm looking for. I don't really want someone who feels the need to brag to me all day, let alone the whole world, of that which they have not even proven...

If your immediate response to my post is something of insult because my words hurt your pride in some way, you're not mature enough (or have enough humor or sarcasm) for my taste.

Am open to men of different races. Am more interested in who you are as a person, but I like what I like as you like what you like when it comes to our preferences. My preferences vary far as what you look like, I won't really know until I know (or until you say something that helps speed that decision along).

Put ""Morning Sunshine"" in subject line so I know you're real. If you just say hi or just ask me for a pic, you're not my type. Pic for pic, by the way. This is a real post, I saw The Hateful Eight yesterday, and my friend and I are in dispute about its meaning (or, in his opinion, its lack thereof).

No seriously Netflix (or Hulu or Amazon) chill and take out? Why don't people do this anymore. Don't get me wrong I love the Netflix and ""chill"" but I don't want just random sex partners anymore. Maybe I'm getting old or maybe I'm just not cool anymore. Anyway a bit about me I'm 28, work a lot so I don't get much time to go out, enjoy Netflix (it's always sunny is my favorite show) I do like going out for dinner once in a while, love all types of music but rock/metal the most. I also don't have many (really any) friends around here so I don't really have anyone to just chill with. I'm more of a rocker chick I have a bunch of tasteful tattoos and a few piercings.

I've been hunting high and low for you! Sorry to have kept you waiting. I've been busy, working on my advanced degree, establishing myself professionally, and becoming the sort of person you might like to meet. 

I love reading, British detective shows, stargazing, road trips, college football, Korean food, hockey, a rainy weekend morning at the museum, outdoor movies in the summer, hiking, Marvel comics, a night at the symphony, a bare knuckles game of Scrabble, proper afternoon tea, rugby, discussing geopolitics, and great hugs. My patriotism is deep, my politics moderate (even in this era of insane incivility). Lately, I've started taken a vegetarian cooking class and learning a little German. While I am somewhat religious, it's not a dealbreaker that you should be.

I enjoy meeting people from all backgrounds, especially those that are smart, kind, and funny. All I ask is that you are truly single and sincere about looking for a relationship. Of course, giving great hugs and smelling great won't hurt. I'm happy to exchange pics but no rush on that if you are shy.

It's Sunday evening. I'm a single black female on cl seeking a single black male. 

I stand 5'3 HWP cute sexy attractive. 

I have some ish with me that I Know bout myself. Nothing bad. Just typical woman ish. Like. Wanting a man to be of his word. Saying what he means and doing what he says. A true gentleman in every sense of the word. Not just Tuesday, Wednesday, and Sunday. Someone who believes in romance. It doesn't take major bucks to Romance a woman. Someone who can appreciate the just because moments. So my ish may not be welcoming to you and I accept that. I may not be for you. We all have our baggage. Its up to the individual to help store, walk away or put up with said baggage. 


Now not saying you won't get typical woman ish like. Being Indecisive. Hint hint at times wanting a man to be a man. Mood swings. Mostly when Im pmsing or mad at the world or when traffic sucks (DMV Area) or the job has given me the blues. Otherwise than that. I'm a typical girly girl. I don't have a team for nan sport but I watch just about all sports. I don't drink beer but do fart in my sleep but blame the dog...shhh I don't have a dog. I don't take forever getting ready 30 minutes wait no 15 minutes at tops. And yes I cry. I am emotional and I owned my ish! Can you??

A little about me...I'm 28, I'm tall and curvy, I have dark hair and eyes with tan skin. I love watching sports, going to the beach, trying new restaurants, mini road trips, TV shows (both the really bad and the really good) and, my favorite, lazy afternoons spent cuddling with someone that you can't stop thinking about :) I live a pretty stable life...I have a great apartment and work at a job that I like that lets me keep pretty normal business hours and prefer to find someone with ambition but who still has time for a relationship (there are a lot of workaholics in this city).

I guess if any of this sounds interesting and you think we'd get along, shoot me an email! I'm hoping to find someone between 27-38 and taller than 6'0 (only because I'm tall as well). I hope to hear from you soon!

Fit, fun, feisty (and flawed, too) professional gal ISO compatible companion for adventures in life, love, and learning. . ..really longing for love again.

About you. You're an active, smart, fit, present, patient, engaged and engaging non player in the 49-56 year old age range. You're 5'9+, well groomed, and know how to treat a woman. You are conversant, compassionate, kind, and healthy in body, mind and sprit. You've got a broad world view, a spirit of openness, and are eager to meet a decent woman. Ideally, one of your greatest virtues is patience.

Me? I'm a petite, blue eyed brunette with boundless energy, a ready smile, and an open heart. Often hear that I look good. Avid hiker who particularly enjoys many of life's simpler pleasures, among them daily exercise, healthy living, children, animals, laughter, the arts, good food, good conversation, lotsa lovemaking with the right one (very important), more laughter. I'm slightly alternative with a preference for the road less travelled. Strong connection to nature, so daily walking has been critical to my well being. I lead an active, sometimes colorful life, always guided by a strong moral compass. Traditional values, monogamy, kindness and integrity are at my core, and at yours as well. If we are compatible, we have a good time no matter what we do together. I'm not a fit with most and discerning about who I do spend time with. 
Still hopeful that you're out there. 
Are you?

If any of this resonates with you, I'd love to hear from you with a non generic reply (no pics please - still enjoy the element of surprise). Preference is to speak by phone fairly early on- we'll know rather quickly if we'd like to meet. As a traditionalist, prefer good old fashioned person to person contact vs. a text, phone or e-mail buddy. Thanks.

Peace

Hi! I am good hearted country girl looking for a real man for friendship that ideally would lead to a long term relationship.

A little about me: Animals are a HUGE part of my life, I have horses and they are my furry children. Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my friends, animals, sewing & trying my skills with other craft type things, bonfires, target shooting, fishing, competing with my horses at local events, anything outdoors really. I have a good sense of humor & love to laugh. I'm not a big partier or club goer, but I like to get out & enjoy life. I'm told that I am loving, extremely honest, fiercely loyal, sarcastic & hard headed. I am a farm girl, and not afraid of mud and getting dirty, but I have a girly side. I have a great group of close friends that I love dearly and am very close with. I am very honest & up front, and have no patience for games, lies or bs. I joke a lot & try not to take life more seriously than needed. Though I try to keep myself busy, I am a firm believer in making time for that special guy in my life. And, I'm a bigger/thick girl, just fyi if that is an issue for you..... I deal with 2,000 lb horses, so I'm not a weak or lazy girl LOL.

The type of guy I'm looking for is HONEST, caring, loyal/faithful, no drama/games/bs, hard working, a gentleman and FUNNY! If you can't joke around we won't get along. I am not at all interested in friends with benefits, random hookups or meaningless flings. I am looking for a relationship. Obviously relationships take time & chemistry, but in a perfect world I would like to find ""the one"". Liking animals earns you HUGE bonus points. No druggies, criminals or thug types. And sorry, I'm only attracted to white guys and around my own age (around 30-40 years old). Just what I like, don't read more into it. I just want a good guy that I enjoy being around. Is that too much to ask?

Please email me with the subject ""hello"" so I know it's not spam (and that you actually read this lol). Please include info about yourself & a pic.... a nice pic, not a dirty pic, I'm a woman not a skank. Good luck to everyone out there, I hope you find the 1.

So, I work in marketing/advertising/PR. I have to watch focus groups for 5 hours tonight (6-11) you heard me.

Anyone up for some witty banter during that time? Well, let's be honest, after my 3rd glass of wine and 900pm rolls around, the banter will just be me bitchy about stupidness.

About me (so you can direct your questions accordingly). I am divorced (relatively recently). I am 34. I am happy.

I am in great great great shape. I am a [solidcore] fiend. I'm tall (sorry) 5'7 and do keep it very toned. But I also love to eat out and travel. I love new experiences and trying different things. I am incredibly open minded and tolerant of everyone.

I love going to the theater and concerts and have many subscriptions. I love getting dressed up. But don't mind a night at home for some board games and wine.

Basically, if I'm going out, I like to do something a tad more adult. But if I'm staying in, it's PJs, board games and going to bed early.

If you want to know anything else, just ask. I'm pretty easy to speak with. If I don't get to your response and it is good, there's a pretty good chance I get to it tomorrow (as i'll be a zombie and my boss isn't in the office).

You've been searching this site for months, some of you Ive seen your screen names for years. Its down right ridiculous that you find yourself still play around on here. Have you ever once got you some good stuff from one of these females???

Have you ever had a date that lasted longer than 10 minutes with someone you met on this site. Its time to change your strategy guys, you're wasting your time. 

I know it feels good to become your alter ego behind the keyboard and screen. Probably really turns you on to act as if you are confident and secure about yourself when in reality you hate yourself and everything about your life. Im just saying what someone should have told you long time ago. Well, im sure many of your parents probably told you once or twice that you wasn't shit and would never be shit. Its more than likely the reason you are abusive to animals and cant get a woman to smile at you ever.

Well hopefully i brightened your day and if you feel the need to reply, I welcome it you need it and maybe we can make some satisfactory changes in your persona because you are losing the way you do things

Salutations!

I'm an attached, voluptuous, medium height, educated black woman, early 30s, looking for stimulating conversation with a mature man. Intelligence is the most attractive thing about a man, not just book smarts but wisdom and emotional intelligence as well. I can't promise anything physical but if you like large lactating breasts, that's something you might experience at a later date. 

I prefer a brown-skinned man who is 5'10"" or taller, with normal to muscular build, but if you can deliver on the conversation, I might be slightly more open-minded. Please note that I am a bit of a liberal/activist type and probably wouldn't get along well with a conservative or particularly religious individual.

Please respond with your favorite woman author, or book written by a woman, and a very brief summary of why you like her/it. 

Thank you.

Have you been gathering knowledge and experiences in the fields of spirituality, mind expansion, parallel realities, self-reflection etc.? 

Have you ever played around with tarot cards, pendulums, meditation, and the like? 

Are you able to see through the mission of mainstream media, and have therefore quit watching TV? 

Do you focus your life on peace, love, and harmony? 

Have you given up nagging and judging, because you realized that you attract negative energies by not giving them up? 

Have you made sense of events in your past by learning the lesson and moving on? 

Do you stay away from electro smog the best way you can? 

Do you stay away from large crowds of people?

Have you quit a job that required being brainwashed, in order to declutter/simplify your life? 

Have you been re-evaluating old beliefs a lot during the last few years?

Can you read people's energies? Do you know if somebody is in integrity without them having said one single word? 

If your answers to the above are ""yes"", you and I definitely have a lot in common. Please send me an email, and let's talk. I am looking for friends (and possibly my soulmate) who I can have exchanges with about what we're currently experiencing on this planet.

WM Gentlemen,

I am a SWF, fit, nice looking, healthy and educated. Though work has always been my focus (I didn't have kids) I'm regrouping and arranging priorities.
I hope there is a man who reads this and can accept the value being proposed.
Looking for the soulmate is too idealistic. I am practical and rather unique. You are too.
What I seek is One man I can define a mutually rewarding path forward wtih.
We will meet for lunch once to share what each of us wants.
I want to hold you and be held by you. I want to be touched in a caring way. I have a loving, caring touch I will extend towards you. This will be simple and genuine. 
This will enrich both of our lives.
You need to be in an upper middle class lifestyle, own a home, entirely healthy but if not your perfect weight this is OK though no one obese. If you have kids you do not ask their permission to on plan or anything else pertaining to your personal life.
I seek companionship and touch initially. Someone with shared interests is extra and not required.
Please read this twice before you reply so I know you accept this and are attracted to this plan.
I seek ONLY a W Heterosexual M, Professional with integrity, age 50s-70. 
If younger men write they will not hear back.
If you are bored and are only going to write to ask for my pic, don't bother. 
Caring touch is a powerful sense and your opportunities to give and receive touch are too infrequent. 
Let's make the spring warmer and more rewarding.
Only those who share the city they live in and kind of career they have will hear back.

Like the title says, I am searching for someone who knows how to let monotony slide and just chuck their worries out the window when they need to be.

Yes, the adventure seeker in me has seen its fair share of driving off at a moment's notice when surreality calls, or even taking on obstacles that nobody wants to tackle because of their messiness. I'm not one to back down off of a challenge, unless it has to deal with fending off my mother....that is the one place I have experienced the guilt....and don't want to return to it lol.

Anyway, back to my adventure: While I am searching for someone to call my other half, I am also in need of a companion for a trip I need to take up to New York on Monday March 21. Yes, who wouldn't want to spend 5 hours in a car....just to turn around later that evening and travel back that same 5 hours? 

I've done this trip several times in the past year, but not only am I without someone to go with me this time, but I'm also without a vehicle. So, in effect, I'm inviting you, and your car/SUV/van on a boring car ride up to New York and back...just so we've got the chance to meet each other and see if we can go from there. 

I promise: I am not an axe murderer, I can be pretty entertaining, and last I checked, my measurements were somewhere along the lines of 42, 30-something, 42.

If you are up for this adventure, let me know if you can help me out on Monday by sometime this evening. If you aren't up for it, I wish you well. There's got to be someone out there for everyone!

Hello. This is to all SWM who are into SBF's and willing to ""jump with me"". I'll explain myself. I am in a relationship that I don't see going anywhere but it's hard for me to leave. I've tried before but it didn't last long. So, I want to see if there is a guy out there willing to get to know me and see what I have to offer. I'd like for you to be in a similar situation or you can be single but willing to jump with me. Will you leave what you know isn't what you want for the rest of your life and be with a woman who will do and be for you all that you desire?







I am sane, educated, shy, silly, blunt, respectful with a big heart. I live, I love, I laugh, I cry, I bleed. I am human just like the next and I seek true love and happiness just like the next. I know that it may sound stupid or shallow to a certain extent but it is what it is. 







Please be open minded, respectful, mature, not afraid of a real woman, marriage, kids or the future. I don't have time for games. I'm a woman that knows what I want. I am big into fitness so I'd like someone who is the same and who is physically active. I am sorry, but this is an absolute must. I promise that I can prove that i am very physically fit and just really want someone who is just as committed to a healthy life as I am. Also, please be no younger than 27 and no older than 37 (no exceptions). I am 29. It's fine if you have a kid or kids already and of course, please be a white male. 







Please include some sort of a decent photo in your first email. I am not looking to collect photos or anything but physical attraction is important to us all, though inner beauty goes a much longer way. Also include a bit about yourself as a person. 







So, I ask again, will you jump with me?

I am having my mid-life crisis ALONE! aieeyeeeeeeeeeeee!

seriously!!!!!-- before we get OLD(er) let's have one last hurrah, shall we?

It's not important to me to get all dressed up and go out on the town. 
(Although it would be nice to wear something formal and attend La Traviata -- at least once!) 

I really enjoy selecting things at the grocery & preparing dinner together-- the healthier the better! 
I would enjoy doing some activities to keep fit like swimming some laps or having
a good long hike together. Watching a movie is nice of course, but not looking for someone
to watch hours of television with. On a rainy day, sometimes nice to just have a quiet day
and sit at opposite ends of sofa under blanket and read the paper and play footsies. I also
would enjoy gardening together and even possibly having a little farmette and taking in some
rescues. I love the countryside, the mountains, and the coast. A little bit of city is ok also
but I prefer the former. 

I sure would like to have one last epic romance with a man who has a big heart and endless
warmth, patience, and kindness. The more romantic the better!!!!

Only a man who loves animals and isn't detested by his former partners- is the sort of man I would love to love and would like to hear from in response to this ad. 

Obviously the less travel time between us the better. But finding the ideal partner is my goal.
I can potentially relocate in ~7 years if that makes things better. I am not opposed to a long-distance
relationship. However, being monogamous, exclusive, and with the same mindset about wanting
a future together is essential. I am seeking someone who doesn't mind having daily phone chats
when we are apart. Texting is ok for this or that, but that's not my preferred forum of communication. 

Women receive so many replies to CL posts. If you are willing to attach your photo that will make
it easier to choose someone to communicate with. In the past I have gotten replies from many men
who seemed like great guys- but I just didn't feel the attraction required to pursue it. So just want to
apologize in advance to those who take the time to contact me and don't receive a response. Hopefully
there is that ONE special person out there for all of us, and we have to remember that and not feel
disappointed when someone doesn't pick us. Anyway-- still hopeful to find my partner and mate!

More about me: I enjoy outdoor events and exercise, day trips, movies, music, time with friends and on and on. More specifically, I also like walking/hiking, mountains, theater and board games once in a while. I'm a good listener and enjoy conversation on just about any topic. 

I like holding hands, laughing at real life and with the right person..... almost anything.

I'm looking for someone fun to create some good times and maybe some occasional trouble ;).

I love sports (watching and playing), traveling, being outside, camping, concerts, tailgating, hoodies, flip flops, and warm weather.

You: love being outside, have a car (I don't live in a metro accessible area), white, no kids, between 34-46, active and would rather be out doing something than at home, live within 20 minutes of Falls Church and looking for something that could end up being long term.

If this sounds like you, shoot me a message! Let me know something about yourself in your email.

I believe in God and don't really dabble in politics so if you are a huge political person, I am not for you. I do not necessarily care if you share the same religious view, as long as you respect me and my beliefs I will do the same for you.

I'm looking for someone who is absolutely single and oh so tired of the online dating scene.

I work, I drive, I pay my own bills, and if you can't tell I know what I want and how to communicate that. I am looking for the same in you.

Do you scratch your head like I do, wondering why it is that people don't listen to one another? I ask myself, why is it so hard to find a nice guy that I can actually have a real conversation with? One where I leave the conversation thinking wow I really connected with him and it was great! Wouldn't you like to find that too?

Lets break the cycle that social media has developed, where we are less able to have a real conversation with another person. Now I am one of those office professionals that communicates mostly through electronic means, and really do see the major benefits of it, but also being of the generation that spent hours gabbing on the corded phone in high school, I know the need for that face to face connection to develop something real and lasting.

That is what I am ultimately looking for my special someone. Because of that, I am going to keep looking until I find him. Could that be you?

My question for you.. Is that nice guy out there in the DMV, who is tired of all the foolishness and games that people play, that simply wants to meet a nice single lady and see where it goes?
I sure would like to meet a nice single guy! At the very least, we could each make a new friend.
Maybe this is a long shot, but what the heck. I'm a DWF looking for a S/DWM.

About me: I am 47, 5'7"", some extra lbs, blonde working professional, so I can take care of myself. . . I am thoughtful, caring, and honest, with a decent sense of humor.. yadda, yadda, yadda...

Here's who I'm hoping to find: S/D WM 40 and up, that is taller than me, with a decent sense of humor that can crack a joke about himself.

Please be able and willing to carry on a conversation through email. I am not looking for endless emails but enough to see if there is some kind of common ground to grow from.

If you want a picture, you need to send one, and lastly, if you are married or attached, answer every Craigslist posting, and send a number or one liner, I will not answer, so please don't waist your time.

So here it is gentleman. 

I am a 39 year-old SWF. I am 5'9. I have brown hair, brown eyes and in the interest of being honest could stand to lose 30 pounds. 

I am witty and smart (in my head at least). I believe I am generous and kind. But I am also very shy in person. I much prefer getting to know someone through texts/emails. 

I love taking pictures, reading, writing among so many other things. 

I have a job with crazy work hours so my time to ""go out"" and meet people is limited and my shyness doesn't help much. 

If you are interested in chatting please respond and include a picture. I will send one in response. I am not looking for a model; what's attractive is different for everyone. But please send a current picture.

I'm an optimist, enjoy social situations as well as some time alone, value my friendships, seek a bit of adventure as well as some level of the familiar. I'd like some good company with a spark...if we can find that it won't matter if we stay in or go out...either way would be more than pleasant. If you are interested in the world, kind and have an easy smile, I'm hoping we'll find each other!

Now that spring is here I'm looking for someone to enjoy both outdoor and indoor activities with. Outdoor including- hiking, kayaking, running or even just long walks on the mall. And as far as the indoor, I'll leave that to your imagination. I'm in my early 20s(so I ask you're not over mid 30s) tall and in fairly good shape, it would be great if you could say the same. 
A picture in your reply would be appreciated!

I'd like to find a good man and Sunday kind of love, as the title says (Google the lyrics for an idea of what I'm talking about). I've been single for a while and though I'm independent and very happy with my life, I feel like a quality relationship where you can share everything is a force multiplier for happiness.

Anyway, a bit about me...I've lived in the area just over 6 years, currently in Arlington on my own and loving it. I'm 28, tall, and curvy. I've been told I have great legs and a beautiful smile! :) More importantly, I consider myself to be kind, witty, smart, reliable, loyal, and affectionate - I hope to find the same in a man! I love watching football, trying new restaurants, long walks when the weather is nice, reading, watching tv/movies, and cooking.

Please send me a message if you'd like to chat and think we may get along. Either way, I hope you have a wonderful 2016!

God made us to be submissive but my heart has hardened and I no longer fill that way. I think its time that my needs come first. Im not going to play games with you men anymore, taking the nice road and always getting hurt. For now on if you can't provide for my happiness then I have no time.
Not every man will like this post or care to reply and im good with that. But Im a hell of a woman. Im loyal, faithful, sexy, cute can cook, clean and take great care of your sexual desires. However, I have been all of that and more and ended up looking like a fool. So from now on Im weighing my options and will demand that you show and prove before any of that occurs.

A real man will read this and recognize that Im hurt, vulnerable and scared but have to stand my ground.

Hopefully I find him

I want someone who has a good sense of humor, smart, likes movies and TV, watches football, basketball, and baseball, interested in going to museums and is also a lover of food. Part of having a LTR is also for me about sex. So it helps if a guy has a healthy libido. I'm a one man kind of woman and you should be a one woman kind of man. I do believe attraction is important as well as face pics help as we get to know one another.

I just can't seem to cross paths with the type of individual I'm looking for. The fact that this person may or may not be modeled on a couple of book characters I've fallen for isn't something I want to think about too much. That seems reasonable for Craigslist.

So I hate admitting my similarities with ""most women"", but like most women I... 

There isn't even another way to say it, is there?

I like a man in uniform. 

There it is. Gross.

What's even more despicable to me about this... fascination? Attraction? Is that it feels very exploitative in nature. It's not so different than the men on here looking for sex to be provided by the specified body parts and types of certain women. I'm rather disgusted with myself, but I am indeed still typing.

To be clear, I'm not looking to exploit anyone in the sexual sense of the word. Though my fantasy life would not object to the proposition of being seduced by a marine in dress blues... Or camis... Sigh... What I really want is much more cerebral. I would like access to the mind of a man who has experienced life on the brink of death. I want to talk with someone who has seen and experienced loss. I'm looking for an individual who has adjusted (or is still adjusting) to the monotony of living a life almost void of risk when compared with life in the service. I know those experiences are sacred for a lot of folks, so I'm not looking for war stories as much as I am looking for the grit and depth of character that having war stories provides. 

I think friendship and conversation is the ultimate goal here. Maybe the Craigslist man of my dreams will be interested in an email buddy of the contentedly married sort. 

Serial killers and rapists need not apply. I'm sure that's implied, but just so we're on the same page, I am not interested in my corpse being stored in a freezer in your basement... if it's on like a yacht or something fancy, perhaps I can be persuaded.

Forgive any typos. I'm too lazy to proofread at the moment.

I am a SWF 55 years young at heart, a career professional.
I am very attractive and sexy with a sweet, tender heart and a kind soul.
I am an empty nester. That is drug and smoke free, seeking the same.
I am a home chef, hoping to find a partner who desires to express his culinary skills.
I am a nature enthusiast and enjoy trips to historic coastal towns, seeking a companion to explore new destinations with.
I am health conscious, learning about organic products and yoga, looking for a companion who desires a healthy mind, body and soul. 

I am looking for a companion close to my age, attractive, clean cut, well groomed, that lives close to DC MD VA. 
I am not interested in a long distance relationship. 

Just like the five C's of a precious gem stone. 
The five C's of a man's facets that are important to me are: Compassion, Confidence, Charm, Charisma and most of all a Curious mind. 

When responding, include a current photo and tell me where you live so I know you are not a SCAMMER.
If you sound interesting, I will return the favor in kind, with a couple of current photos, my location and my cell number. 
I am not doing endless emails that lead nowhere.

May you be blessed in your search. . .

I've decided to take ""missed connections"" in a different direction...by searching for a connection that I am missing.

You: are a tall, vegetarian or vegan man between 30-35 that does not mind a girl almost as tall as you. You are sensitive, but masculine. You can sweet talk me while fixing up the house. You love travel and spontaneity, but don't mind being a homebody many days. You love children, and are especially patient with rambunctious two year old boys who drive their mother crazy. You are family oriented and want your own. You are easy going and positive in nature. You love Scrabble. You don't mind your girlfriend/fiancĂŠ/wife bringing home stray animals to foster because they are her weakness. You love music from more than one genre and don't mind at all listening to Wilco, Bruce Springsteen, and Bone Thugs all in one day. 



Most importantly, you don't mind watching the Bachelor and pretending to like it with your girlfriend/fiancĂŠ/wife. You understand that your g/f/w has high standards and expectations because of this show and doesn't want to settle for anything less than the idealistic romance like she sees on the Bachelor(minus the 24 other girls). In particular, you know she just wants someone to look at her the way Ben Higgins looks at Lauren Bushnell. You have a sense of humor enough to know that she knows what she is posting on Craigslist is completely and utterly ridiculous....BUT hey, it's worth a shot, and he might be out there...right???



*I did not post a picture for fear of attracting too many of the wrong people. I only plan to respond to an intelligent man who takes the time to read everything I've written and knows he is the closest thing possible to what I am looking for. Please feel free to share your picture if you feel you are eligible, and if your response is promising, I'd love to share mine. Naked or ab pictures may make me physically ill, so please refrain.

Like the title says, I am just hoping to find love and figured I might as well cast a net here to see what I may find - you never know where someone special might find you, right?

A little about me...I'm 28, I'm tall and curvy, I have dark hair and eyes with tan skin. I love watching sports, going to the beach, trying new restaurants, mini road trips, TV shows (both the really bad and the really good) and, my favorite, lazy afternoons spent cuddling with someone that you can't stop thinking about :) I live a pretty stable life...I have a great apartment and work at a job that I like that lets me keep pretty normal business hours and prefer to find someone with ambition but who still has time for a relationship (there are a lot of workaholics in this city).

I guess if any of this sounds interesting and you think we'd get along, shoot me an email! I'm hoping to find someone between 27-38 and taller than 6'0 (only because I'm tall as well). I hope to hear from you soon!

Hello! I already know guys either love or hate my body type, so I've attached a pic to get that out of the way so you know what you're getting into. I'm a curvy and cute lady who really wants to find a loving and lasting relationship. I love to travel, camp, ride motorcycles, go out to dinner, or make some homecooked meals for a good man who appreciates me.

I've been described by friends as a bit of a free spirit, yet very down to earth when it comes to business and my finances. I like to be very sweet and kind to those closest to me, but I also have no problems speaking up for myself and saying it like it is. I love to get out in the mountains, camp by a river, walk the shoreline, window shop, basically just get out and LIVE! I don't stay home much, and I don't even own a TV. I do attend church as well.

I honestly have everything I need in life. Except my last partner. In my mind, I picture him to be white, aged 40-55 with a bigger build, and tends to have a rugged look. (Country boy/outdoors type/ Harley Rider/hunter/you get the idea - sorry, that's my type and I stick to it. I also don't date younger guys. Even 40 is pushing it for me.)

He is SINGLE (not married, not separated, no other gf's he hasn't cut loose yet, or other strings attached), he is WILLING (past the casual hookup stage, wants a serious relationship, not still hung up on his last gf), and he is ABLE (doesn't work 24/7, doesn't have so many family obligations that you are dead last in his life, and has plans to make someone part of his life).

So, I think I've given you enough to work with. Your pic gets mine. I don't expect a lot of responses since I'm being so specific, but that's ok. I only need to find the one true guy for me.

Hello. This is to all SWM who are into SBF's and willing to ""jump with me"". I'll explain myself. I am in a relationship that I don't see going anywhere but it's hard for me to leave. I've tried before but it didn't last long. So, I want to see if there is a guy out there willing to get to know me and see what I have to offer. I'd like for you to be in a similar situation or you can be single but willing to jump with me. Will you leave what you know isn't what you want for the rest of your life and be with a woman who will do and be for you all that you desire?

I am sane, educated, shy, silly, blunt, respectful with a big heart. I live, I love, I laugh, I cry, I bleed. I am human just like the next and I seek true love and happiness just like the next. I know that it may sound stupid or shallow to a certain extent but it is what it is. 

Please be open minded, respectful, mature, not afraid of a real woman, marriage, kids or the future. I don't have time for games. I'm a woman that knows what I want. I am big into fitness so I'd like someone who is the same and who is physically active. I am sorry, but this is an absolute must. I promise that I can prove that i am very physically fit and just really want someone who is just as committed to a healthy life as I am. Also, please be no younger than 27 and no older than 37 (no exceptions). I am 29. It's fine if you have a kid or kids already and of course, please be a white male. 

Please include some sort of a decent photo in your first email. I am not looking to collect photos or anything but physical attraction is important to us all, though inner beauty goes a much longer way. Also include a bit about yourself as a person. 

So, I ask again, will you jump with me?

95% of all the ads from ""women"" on CL are fake. Most are bots, scammers, spammers, identity thieves or hookers. The identity thieves will ask for your phone number, give you theirs right away in their first reply, or post their number in their ads. They will then take your phone number and try to send malware to your cell phone to steal your identity in order to rip you off. The spammers will send you a ""personal"" email addy right away in their first reply, or put one in their ad for you to write to. They will then take your email address and send malware, viruses and Trojans to your email account to try to infect your computer, or they will sell your email addy to mass mailers who then flood your inbox with all kinds of advertising. 

Hookers will ask you for money for sex, of course, and the scammers will try and get you to send them money for all kinds of reasons, the most common being plane tickets so they can come to meet you...every single last ""woman"" from ""over seas"" is a scammer without exception. If you are stupid enough to send money to someone you don't know over the internet, then you DESERVE to be scammed. It really only takes a little common sense to determine if an ad is real or not...if the response to your reply to an ad doesn't say a single word about anything you wrote to them, it's fake. If an ad insists on you sending picture with ""no pic no reply"" or something to that effect, just flag it...most of the time it's a scammer looking to steal your pictures to use to scam other people with. It's either that, or you have a shallow, worthless woman who cares only about looks, and if you're not good looking, you're not worth knowing, so you'll be wasting your time...even if you are good looking, as she's a shallow, worthless woman who isn't worth a pint of piss to anyone.

All that being said, my last 3 live-in relationships were with black women (I'm white) I met here on CL...the last one lasted 3 1/2 years, so it CAN be done. You just have to have the patience to wade through all the crap that plagues ALL online dating sites, not just CL. I've found through personal experience that the pay for web sites are even WORSE than CL. At least CL is free.

Happy hunting! :)

I am trying to get fit/lose weight and enjoy taking fitness classes to motivate me to be active, but unable to afford the classes I enjoy such as yoga, pilates, boxing..etc. Hoping to find a gentleman who might be up for sponsoring me? Along the way maybe a partner to join me in these classes as well and we develop a FWB relationship? I am only interested in the midtown and below area, since I live and work around that area it's just easier to get to these classes. 

I am heavy set BBW in my late 30's and prefer someone around my age or a bit older. It would be fun to do this together and help each other. If this does work out for us you must be able to host ""our"" fun times and again prefer you are in . If you have the means to make this happen and interested in knowing more contact me and let's see if we can make this work. Thanks.














































I am single and would like to meet single people, 's only who are definitely non-smokers and live locally in the . I am independent, responsible and mature. My kids are grown and out of the house...looking for same. I make friends easily. I have a lot of friends actually, but somehow life still seems a bit lonely without a partner. I have a nice apt, good vehicle, good day job/s, finances under control and my life under control... Looking for same. I enjoy cooking healthy, eating in/out, live music, trying different activities, meeting genuinely good people with positive outlooks on life in general. The type of people I mesh well with are those whose lives are drama free, have a positive outlook on life, have a good clean sense of humor and a stable lifestyle. These qualities fit the person I am all about today. I fully believe in the old saying, ""treat people the way you want to be treated."" I have met people who do not live by this and it never works for me. I also believe in making a good impression every time I meet people. I enjoy having clean conversation including clean language. I enjoy eating healthy, staying in good shape physically and believe in keeping my weight in proportion to my height... looking for same. I have preferences in my life, but I am not beyond looking outside the box to healthy alternative ideas/suggestions...I hope to find someone who thinks the same and is not so set in his ways that his ways are set in stone. I believe in give and take...negotiating and coming up with new ideas. If you do not work nights and have early evening time to get out and socialize away from work please send me a current pic (w/clothes), your age and please tell me about you...what is it about you that attracts people to you (personality, interests...). If I feel an attraction and we have a few things in common, I will definitely respond. Lets see what happens... 





















































































































































I hate using craigslist for this, and I acknowledge the risks. I'm a very independent 22 year old seeking a Dom/Daddy for a potentially poly relationship. I am not and wont consider monogamy. I am dating and am friendly with a current Daddy and he is fully aware that I am seeking another. He just wants me safe. Now that that is out of the way, a little about me. I've been into the bdsm/kink for a year and a half, so I'm still fresh-ish to it. I lead a very dominant life style, I'm a single mom with one daughter and no more. I have my own place. My job requires me to lead all the time. I need a break from that and this is where I get it. I love to read, sing, draw, and daydream. Cooking is my life, I'm a nerdy girl, and I have a huge cat names falkor....give a guess as to where that came from haha. Here's where it gets tough. I have herpes 2, I take my medicine everyday to avoid out breaks and transfering it to my other partner/s. If your ok with this and understand it then awesome. YOUR PHOTO GETS MY PHOTO, I WILL NOT RESPOND TO DICK PICS. I require that you be std free, and you have a sense of caring about your hygiene

Its cherry blossom season. Yes, I am real. If you would like me to respond to you, please dont reply in what amounts to clicks and grunts. 

I once read an article that being with a fat girl is like being with one giant boob. It made me laugh. 

So, about me, I am a fat girl, obviously. I am funny, with a dark sense of humor. Tall, (and not scared of shorter men), buxom, super sexy, and easy to please (meaning, I don't have a long list of demands that you must satisfy on a daily basis). I dress cute, dont own the first mu-mu. I have a make up addiction, but have no fear of leaving the house without it. I smell really, really, good.

I like to travel, I like to do cultural fun stuff (that I wont drag you to, at least all of the time) I like to eat (hey, one benefit of a fat girl is she always has an opinion on where to go for dinner). I have a high IQ, but I appreciate mind numbing activities to decompress from work. 

About you. You are a white, single, male. You have a fondness for for fat girls, and realize they are few and far between in this city of runners. You actually want to date a fat girl, not just carry out your secret dirty fetishes on her. Hey, we can do that later, I am all for secret dirty fetishes. You're fun. Oh come on, you know if you're fun or not. You and I have instant conversational chemistry. 

Bonus points if you are in the military. ( I will save the secret dirty military fetishes I have, for later too. )

I am a lightskin black bbw and you must be happy with that.  I am looking for a monogamous FLR for an LTR. I have always been naturally assertive and I'm finally trying to embrace that about myself.  I'm not here to educate you on what this type of relationship is, the Internet can do that.  I'm looking for the devotion of this type of relationship more than the crazy bedroom stuff...but that doesn't mean I'm not open to exploring with the right man. 

I am a normal girl who is funny, intelligent, caring, considerate, thoughtful,  romantic, and educated.  I am a full time professional so I'm not looking to be supported nor am I looking to support anyone.  

I'm looking for an unattached man who is between 28-40, educated, professional, caring, gentle,  attractive, considerate, romantic, slim, fit, medium build. A man that believes women should be catered to like the goddess they were born to be. I am short but do prefer taller men (over 5'10). The ideal man would be self sufficient in his daily life but prefer to cater to his woman. So alpha male at work and sub for me. He must be drug and disease free, non smoker, completely unattached, and serious about this lifestyle.  My preference is someone who has tried this before and can teach me more about it while growing with me. I'll be honest I am very interested in interracial dating but I don't like to exclude anyone. 

Reply with ""all about you"" in the subject, tell me about yourself, and add a picture. I'm more likely to respond to those that took time to compose a message. Verification that you are who you say you are will be required as things progress.

I am a SWF looking for a SWM for dating which would hopefully lead to a LTR. I am not looking for a fwb (if that's what I wanted I don't need cl for that, just sayin). I do have pics to share but please don't expect me to send mine unless you are willing to do the same. Hope to hear from you. If you plan on emailing me please be close to my age, if you have to ask what that means we probably aren't a good fit.

Do you know what a female lead relationship is? Can you submit to this in every aspect of your life? If you think so then I may be the one for you. Although the chances of serving Me are slim, as I am very selective. I will only consider those males who understand My message and believe in the good of Female-led relationships; I take only the best. I also have to actually like a male who serves Me and find something useful in him. This means building a relationship, not setting up a check-out line for here today, gone tomorrow types. If you are serious about pursuing this endeavor, you should first send me a good rated picture and what flr means to YOU! Please don't send me some random a answer from Google. I will consider all types but I prefer an older white male. I am an AA female, tall and average built.

I'm seeking one single or divorced man for a committed relationship.

It's my ultimate goal, I know that it will take time and I'm willing to invest it.
You should have the time for a relationship in your life right now. If you're married to your work, we won't be a good match. This is a long-term offer for a commitment, not something that you want to do on an occasional weekend.
I will always treat you with respect, compassion and consideration, and I expect that you will treat me the same way. I'm an affectionate woman and need a man who can match that. But we have to get there first.

You should be 35-45, white, college educated, intelligent, employed, healthy, in a very good shape, DDF, able to hold a decent conversation and have your life together.
I prefer clean - shaven men.
I'm very selective because I know my worth.

I'm not interested in FWB, NSA, please don't contact me with such offers.

Please be local to me, preferably in Maryland, and include your location, marital status and schedule.

No smoking, excessive drinking or cats.
Please provide face pics and the necessary details. Writing something meaningful in your response is the best way to get noticed.

I'm looking to become friends first, going to museums, hiking, concerts, matinees together.

Put your favorite artist into the Subject line.

I recently moved back to DC after living away for the last 10 years and thought I'd try out CL to meet someone. I'm not looking for a serious LTR but also not looking to sleep around with a bunch of guys. Ideally looking for someone to spend time with while getting to know the city again and enjoy each other's company but let it be casual. 

About me: 38 year old SWF. 5'8, brown curly hair, blue eyes, curvy build. NGO worker, wine drinker, dog and cat lover. Pretty active lifestyle.

About you: ideally 35-45ish years old. Educated professional with a good sense of humor. 5'10 and above, anything but morbidly obese. 

If you're interested please reply and change the subject to your favorite local sports team so I know your real. It'd be great if you included a pic, but I understand if you don't in your initial reply just be willing to share very soon.

Had luck here on Craiglist before but in the end things didn't work out. Hoping to find a great guy! I've moved on from my last relationship and want to find a new exciting partner! Must be DDF, clean, white professional male and please be able to host. I cannot due to being a single mom. I'm white female, great career, very caring and loving partner! Bonus, if your a great lover, I'm a squirter!
Please be local to Alexandria so it makes it easier for flexibility to meet.
I'm the girl next door type and a sweetheart, or I've been told. Someone you could bring home to mom if things developed into a long term relationship.
As with any post there are lots of responses, however I'm only looking for one partner. One guy I can develop an ongoing sexual relationship with. I'm not the type to jump beds with multiple men. I desire one man to develop an ongoing intense sexual relationship with so that we can explore one another's likes and fantasies. 
Looking forward to hearing from you.
I will gladly provide a pic later and voice verify that I'm real if there is mutual interest.

Ok, ok, so you've skipped past your misgivings about how weird I could possibly be and you're here! Thank you for taking the challenge of ""meeting me""- kind of. 

I am seeking a relationship that is based on respect and kindness, a partnership where narcissism isn't allowed in, where mutual teacher-student roles are taken on by both of us and learning is one of our passions during our time here. If you've been on a similar journey, have read Eckart Tolle, ACIM, CWG, Carlos Castaneda and Ruth Montgomery, I'd love to talk to you. 

The right ""you"" for me will be kindly intelligent (a person can be a ""sarcastic, mean- intelligent so there is a distinction), quick-witted, understanding and adventurous. I'm a highly intuitive woman and also Empathic so finding a mate who sees the beauty in that and won't run from someone who lives her life free of the need to watch TV, gossip, or display random acts of disloyalty would be wonderful.

I am a 33 y.o. petite AA female. I am a professional and have been fortunate enough to work in my field for over a decade.

I am here because I am serious about love and I hope you are too!

I am a Christian and it's important to me that my partner have a relationship with Christ to. I am more concerned with matters of the heart vs. physical appearance. I care more about substance....are you a good person? How do you treat those you love? Are you faithful and able to commit? 

I am by no means looking to rush things (I have seen where that gets me) but I don't plan on dating for a decade either!

Why canvas door to door when you can just reach across the aisle? If our priorities align, and you can campaign hard and are firm in your resolve, perhaps I will yield you some of my minutes on the floor and permit you to explore my loopholes. Am not seeking donations or expecting you to sign any vows of support---honest, open dialogue, and a genuine interest in my infrastructure are enough to win my vote. As long as we do not experience a huge income gap and respect one another's environments, we should be able to build a sustainable coalition. Let's make America great again!

Fun loving, independent, happy-go-lucky, warm, witty, and wise. Refined, but not snobby. Seeking high quality male companionship to unwind with. Enjoy road trips, obscure museum pilgrimages, sharing home cooked meals and raucous conversation, performing arts, long walks and bike rides, camping, and life's little pleasures. Please don't misunderstand my opening paragraphs, that's just my sense of humor.

Seeking a gentleman with a mature perspective and an open mind and heart who can hold up his end of a conversation, or enjoy silence when the moment calls for it. I've lived, and continue to live, an interesting life, have traveled the world, etc. so I don't need a man for excitement, or to save me from boredom. What I'm looking for is someone to enjoy the simple things with on weekends and vacations, some attachment without smothering. I am focused on my career and am pretty busy. No time for lengthy email correspondence, so be willing to move to phone quickly and meet soon.

No drugs, non-smoker, very light drinker, stable, US citizen. Would prefer someone with similar qualities and a positive attitude. Please be age-appropriate, not married, and live reasonably close by. FYI, I am fat (in all the right places). I mention it not because I am proud of it, but to be honest and efficient.

I'm looking for someone that is not afraid to commit, is reliable and doesn't lie. I know that is rare, but I do believe there are some out there. I am open minded, and not overly opinionated. I think most people like things done their own way if they can, but I am reasonable and do listen. 

I don't like laziness and am a hard worker myself. I can be laid back or the opposite. I enjoy good conversation, laughing, and stimulating verbal communication. I know it's not easy taking a chance - again, but I am worth it once I am hooked.

I have travelled a lot domestically and internationally.I believe in spiritual growth and commitment, while not being over the top. I consider myself to be very patriotic and still feel pride of country rise up in me, when I hear the national anthem.Moving forward in life is what matters to me, and is what really counts with me. Kissing is a passion.......I am passionate in so many aspects of my life, looking for my equal. Ultimate goal for everyone is to take a chance and connect with someone, whether it is for a short time or hopefully, on a long term basis. 

Seeking someone who wants to ""complement"" my life as I wish to do the same for them. Strong in their Christian faith as I, but do enjoy having fun. Would like to continue life's journey with my soul-mate experiencing the exciting journey that fate has in store for us, enjoying learning about each other and exploring old and new places together. Enjoy have fun as well as quiet times, it is about quality time with someone special. 

Very compassionate, as well as passionate with people I care about. Communication and honesty are high on my list of needs. If you like to communicate and are sincere and honest, then let's ""strike up as match"" and see if we would be good together to continue life's journey. I am looking for age range from 45-upward.

Another weekend is over and I hope you had fun this weekend. I spent time with my family like I normally do most weekends, however something was different this time. I miss being a couple. I miss sharing a smile or an inside joke with that special someone. I miss the hand holding and sharing an embrace. Having gone through a horrible breakup last year the kind that wrecks your world and sends you in to a free fall. I decided to take some time off from dating. I needed to heal, I needed to find my happy place, I needed to find me and what I wanted. I'm finally in a place where I am happy again and the eternal optimistic that I am is hopeful about life and love. I am sure you're wondering ""why Craigslist of all places?"" Well I am not much in to bars or the club scene these days. I work with kids and most everyone in my life is either married or coupled off. Do you ever get tired of being the third wheel?? I am!! I know this is a crazy chance to take but a few years ago I adopted my amazing dog from here and maybe I am hoping that this site well serve me well this time around as well.

I would love to meet someone between the ages of 32 and 42. I know age is just a number to some people but I want to be able to relate to the person I am with. I myself am 34 and have never been married nor do I have any kids. I personally don't care if you have kids or have been married before. As long as you have little or no drama in your life we'll be fine. I am only interested in dating Caucasian males. I hope you understand that this is a preference of mine and not a prejudice. Being that this is CL after all I must stress that I am NOT looking for a friend with benefits or a one night stand. If you send me pictures of your junk I will post it on the male for male section of CL with all your contact information :-)

I hope you take a chance and send me an email. While I am not brave enough to post a picture on here I have tons of them and will happily send you one with my reply. Replies with pictures will get the most preference. It's always nice to see who I'm emailing. Take a chance and let's be brave! We might be completely wrong for each other or completely right. Take a leap of faith with me. The only regrets we have in life are the risks we never took :-)

I'm smart,
I'm drama free,
I'm open to trying new things-within reason,
I can carry good conversations, Im a good listener. 
I'm not a party on the scene kind of person. I'm more on the homebody type.
I'm honest, and very loyal.
Std and mostly drug free (i smoke weed, not a lot but I do smoke here and there) * only drink socially.
Im fat, not disgusting its belly fat (let's just say I get asked how far along I am), I am very pretty though. People say to me all the time of only you would loose your belly you'd be hot. I need some one to work me out, and make me want to stick to a diet. I need encouragement and rewards.
I work, I can take care of myself but sometimes I feel like i want some one else to do it, or the securty that someone else would.

I want gifts and dates and real conversations.

Im asking for a lot right? 
Well I'm worth it, trust me if you take care of me I take care of you. I'm fun, It sounds bad once you say it all aloud but hey it is Craigslist.

I'm picturing you as a DWM, a big guy (6 feet tall and not skinny) who's a professional, lots of energy, , alpha male type. If this sounds like you, I would love to hear from you. We could find that balance together.

It is a dream, your dream, YOUR destiny to fall before this Goddess and to serve under her high heel adorned feet. If serving a Goddess comes naturally to you, this is opportunity hanging right in your reach. You will be my pet to do with as I please. Putty in my hands to mold into my perfect toy. I am smart, exotic, beautiful, and everything you've ever dreamed of in a Goddess. Why wouldn't you want to serve me? I will give you the gift of release from the torture of daily decision making and allow you relief in your submission. In return you will receive the honor of having your filthy existence acknowledged by a Goddess far out of your league. Submission will never feel so good and no Goddess will ever be up to par. Imagine discreetly licking my leather boots in public while everyone passes by not knowing what a little sissy boy you are. Mmm...submission never tasted so good. Now, stop imagining and turn this into your reality. Find your release in submission. Put ""Thank you Goddess"" in the subject line so I know you're real.

I am a single white female, college educated, 40, no kids, attractive, employed, fit, fun and a lover of baseball! I don't know all the stats of all the players, or who wears what brand of sock, but I do understand the sport and I love a day at D.C's own leading LEED stadium! Tickets are on me! My ""package"" came with 2 burgers and 2 beers and a pair of sunglasses! 

Bring a hat, some sunblock and your witty banter and easy going personality and let's go! 

I imagine I will receive several responses, so to weed out spam, the guys in jail (YES, convicts have access to the internet! LOL) and the married ""but only on paper"" guys, the following are my caveats:
You must be a heterosexual male who is in my appropriate dating age range. Say, about 35-47 +/- for good measure. I can't really have a hot 24 year old on my arm. . .. Well, I take that back- I can! And given the right 24 year old hottie, I'd be willing to make an exception ;-) After all, it is just a baseball game! 

You must be really SINGLE (Not ""separated"", Not ""attached"", Not ""engaged"", or otherwise encumbered with a partner. I don't disrespect other women, and I won't be a party to your lies or wishful thinking)

You must be FUN! 

You must have higher than a High School Education. Please do not respond to me if you've never traveled outside of your zip code or if you've never been on a plane. 

You must be not be a jack-ass. My tickets are part of my alumni group, and I can't have a Johnny Knoxville wannabe as my date. If you act like an ass, or get drunk, I will distance myself from you, block your #, and leave with someone else. Simple.

Other than those few things, I don't have a whole lot of requirements. Just be easy going, like baseball and open to meeting new people!

Opening weekend at the stadium! Should be a fun time!

Looking forward to your reply!

We're all seeking that special person who is right for us. But if you've been through enough relationships, you begin to suspect there's no right person, just different flavors of wrong. Why is this? Because you yourself are wrong in some way, and you seek out partners who are wrong in some complementary way. but it takes a lot of living to grow fully into your own wrongness. and it isn't until you finally run up against your deepest demons, your unsolvable problems the ones that make you truly who you are that we're ready to find a lifelong mate. only then do you finally know what you're looking for. you're looking for the wrong person. but not just any wrong person: the right wrong person someone you lovingly gaze upon and think, ""This is the problem i want to have.""

I am looking for a long term relationship with a romantic, respectable and wonderful man who is stable and knows what he wants in life and also willing to take risks in a relationship, a man that is not self centered or selfish . I am loving, caring and sincere. Very passionate and loyal. Romantic, nice dinners, walks on the beach. Life is too short to spend it alone.. I am hoping to find a nice guy to enjoy some quality times with.. I don't do or tolerate drugs, heavy drinkers that end up drunk. I don't ever go to clubs or bars I'm not into that scene at all! I love the water,beach, river,lake,I like to camp,fish,anything outdoors really! I absolutely love to cook so hope you love to eat!! I'm kinda old fashioned and believe the woman should take care of the household, always have a meal cooked for my man every night, house cleaned,laundry done etc. And always make sure my partner is happy and full filled in all areas! I have a lot of respect for myself and have morals,never been a girl that sleeps around. Maybe this isn't the right place to find my mr. Forever but maybe ill get lucky and find him, who knows? I'm also looking for my partner to be my best friend,soul mate and lover! I'll send a pic if you send yours! DON'T ask for dirty or nudes I am NOT that kinda girl! So, if your looking for a GOOD woman like me please respond! Also, being honest,genuine,and real is super important because I am all those things!!

Since my relationship had ended I've not had much in the way of adult companionship. I'm interested in someone who wouldn't mind a movie or night on the couch veggie out until work the next day. I really enjoy an evening out experiencing new restaurants or warm summer nights walking through the monuments. 

It seems to me many people in this area have commitments, obligations, schedules...etc. which demand a lot of their time. I understand, I'm no exception.

I've graduated from college, I have a (somewhat) hectic work schedule, I have two kids, and I own my own house; which I spend a lot of time working on. Although, I find raking my yard cathartic (at times. There's something to be said about occasionally getting dirty and feeling accomplished from working up a sweat.

I am most attracted to white men. An affinity I developed when I rediscovered America. If you are interested email me. Let's see if our weekend may include a trip to the zoo, museum, or D.C.

P.S. I have two kids. Pretty decent age difference between them.

Hi
I am usually attracted to a man (45+, any race) who is warm, charming, educated, well traveled, enjoys the finer things in life but also enjoys a quiet relaxed atmosphere. 

A little about myself. I am black, educated, spiritual, a little reserved, sensual, sophisticated, positive, I avoid drama and possessive men etc. I enjoy a variety of things such as cooking, fine dining, reading, world news, traveling, warm weather, beaches etc. 

The relationship l envision would be one that is stress free, giving each other space at a comfortable level, good communication and cultivating the relationship with no stress/drama but with warmth and respect for each other.

Thanks

I'm mixed with super curly long hair, light brown skin and brown eyes. I have nice teeth. 5'5. I'm a little curvier than usual thanks to grad school (and not as a euphemism - I am actually curvy), but it will be gone by the summer. We can do paleo and the gym together if you're in to that ;-). I am the world's worst texter. 

I hope you are completely happy with work. Completely over the casual dating scene and your ex-girlfriend. You are kind of old-fashioned. You are taller than me. Hopefully by quite a bit. You are looking forward to (gasp!) marriage one day and looking for something serious. You are not a murderer. You probably do not have any kids (maybe one). You're completely open to new stuff including this new girl that wants you to take her out randomly on a Friday night. 

But first, we have to get drinks. So, you should answer this craigslist ad and send me your picture, so I can send you mine and we can maybe talk for a second before we get those drinks ;-). I was thinking like 10:30 - 11 ish, so get on it! :)

I'm seeking one single or divorced man for a committed relationship.

It's my ultimate goal, I know that it will take time and I'm willing to invest it.
You should have the time for a relationship in your life right now. If you're married to your work, we won't be a good match. This is a long-term offer for a commitment, not something that you want to do on an occasional weekend.
I will always treat you with respect, compassion and consideration, and I expect that you will treat me the same way. I'm an affectionate woman and need a man who can match that. But we have to get there first.

You should be 33-44, white, college educated, intelligent, employed, healthy, in a very good shape, DDF, able to hold a decent conversation and have your life together.
I prefer clean - shaven men.
I'm very selective because I know my worth.

I'm not interested in FWB, NSA, please don't contact me with such offers.

Please be local to me, preferably in Maryland, and include your location, marital status and schedule.

No smoking, excessive drinking or cats.
Please provide face pics and the necessary details. Writing something meaningful in your response is the best way to get noticed.

I'm looking to become friends first, going to museums, hiking, concerts, matinees together.

Put your favorite artist into the Subject line.

""Whenever I go into a restaurant, I order both a chicken and an egg to see which comes first""


Dear Mr. Right,

As a daydreamer with a vivid and colorful imagination, it was hard for me to put my daydreams of my fairytale man to the side. But I am.

It's hard.

It's hard to truly let go, and let God work. This comes from someone who is a recovering control freak. . .especially when it comes to relationships. I wanted to control every aspect: the meeting, the pursuit, the conversation, and the timing. I was always told that my Mr. Right is somewhere out there. After all, there are plenty of fish in the sea. But I didn't want just a fish. . . I wanted my one true love and I wanted him NOW.

I was impatient. I searched for love and acceptance in all the wrong places. I sought it out in people that continually failed me. I would often see a guy in Starbucks and think, ""could he be the one?"". . .I mean he did have really nice hair. I did not understand why I was the girl that never had the awesome boyfriend. To be honest Mr. Right, I would pray for you every night. I remember tears running down my face because I so badly wanted to find you. I truthfully wanted that fairytale moment with you, when our eyes met from across the room and we immediately fell in love. I wanted the fireworks and the distant sound of triumphant music and even the cute little floating hearts above our heads, because I thought, ""I had found the one made just for me.""

You should have HSV or know what it is and be ok with me having it. Please also have a fun-loving personality with positive energy (no pun intended). 

I'm a single Black female, shorter than average, curvy/few extra pounds, non-smoker, very minimal drinker, Christian, and relationship-minded and want a family oneday if it's God's plan. I also have HSV, hence you needing to know what that is and/or having it if you're looking to be more than friends.

I like going out to the movies, out to eat, parks, bowling, exercising, walks, playing pool, going to museums, playing Spades, Scrabble and video games.

That's a little about me but that's enough for now. So movies...me and you...maybe lunch or dinner before or after...or a walk in the park or a museum (surprise me). Pic for pic, no exceptions (for all I know, you could be that psycho around the corner who keeps calling me Janie and asking me stupid questions...). Oh yeah, have a sense of humor, be a bit sarcastic but humble at the same time (no one loves an asshole, we just pretend we do). What I require is pretty much what is above. Much else is flexible, so if you are wondering then just ask. Hopefully I'll talk to you soon.

I'm just like ""one of the guys"" I don't think like a normal woman and don't act like one. 

Life is to short to conform to what the average person believes is normal. Sometimes you have to give the totally unexpected a chance, you might end up in a really good situation 


I enjoy indoors and outdoors activities. Live bands and open mic nights. I like to drink the craft beers and go on wine tours. I'm very simple, I like to go and do pretty much anything. I work full time in the healthcare field. I'll eventually go back to school to further my education. I like to talk to people, about everything, I myself have a problem opening up at times but ask the right questions you'll get the answer. I love animals, family oriented and I'm goal driven. I don't need anyone, I'd like to make that clear. I can be very forward at times. I've learned over some time that you gotta lay everything out there on the line if you wanna get anywhere. I can be an a**hole at times. I believe in you get what you give. I am very observant, sometimes it appears I'm not paying attention or listening but I am. I pay attention to the little things...that's what matters most. I could go on but this is so informal and I just don't think I can talk about myself in it very well. So if your curiosity sparks then message me. I don't do head games and I avoid drama at all costs. Be real with me from the get go and I will give that to you in return.

First of all I have to say that I am a woman who is ready for love! The whole my life I have been dreaming about a strong and loving family, about a caring husband and happy children, I was dreaming to become a happy woman and everybody knows that for every woman the most important is family happiness. Career can't become everything for me. I am sure I can become a good wife and to make the life of my future husband happy. I think I have many good qualities, I am loyal, caring, honest, understanding and sincere person and I am looking for the same qualities in my future man. 

The most important for me is to see a strong and caring man by my side, I want him to be a one woman man because I am a one man woman. I want him to be caring, loving, understanding, I want him to treat me with respect to my views and habits. The best man can be compared with a lion, he needs a lioness by his side, and being a king a man will treat his woman like a queen. Of course it is important for me to find a family oriented man because I am here to find a man to get married with, I want to have a family and of course I want him to have the same purpose.so if you read all this and you think you are the man am looking for here use your email address as subject line and a pic so I know you are real don't send me hey hi what up cause I won't respond

Hi,

So I've recently ended a short term but intense relationship with someone who had very specific desires. While he was adamant that he was not into the BDSM lifestyle, in my opinion there were some definite overlaps. While I was not originally very knowledgeable about, or accepting of, these needs, through this experience I have come to have a change of heart. 

While I am not still hung up on my ex, I will use our relationship to describe what I am looking for in the future:

We had a very intense physical attraction, that I would like to have again. I knew he wanted me because he told me so....repeatedly. It was intense and really nice and significantly helped to improve my self esteem. We also had a pretty deep emotional connection, even though his reluctance to label it as an actual ""relationship"" led to its downfall,

Moving on:
He naturally took the ""lead"" in the relationship, and it was nice to surrender to someone who genuinely cared, and was completely devoted, even if that wasn't stated verbally. His feelings were in his touch, which many times were rough and gentle at the same time. He liked to say ""good girl"" when I did something well, or just pleased him in general. I sort of took pleasure in knowing that I was doing a good job, or that he was very excited because of me. I felt controlled, but also in control....if that makes sense. However, if I was a bad girl I had to be punished....lovingly. Usually this was accomplished by means of a spanking. (hand). Then he would rub me and say that he was sorry but I had to be punished. The tenderness and roughness combined was quite exciting. He liked to call me ""princess"", and I must admit that I enjoyed being the center of his attention.

My work is extremely stressful and I have spent my (fairly short) life under extreme self control, and have accomplished a lot. It is nice to have a sort of balance brought into my life. At work I am in control and at home I am controlled. I also think that if expressed correctly, it is the most natural way for men and women to interact. 

I was never abused in my relationship and don't look forward to it. I have a very limited sexual experience, due to some not so hidden insecurities and some childhood trauma. However, instead of being turned off by my inexperience he was eager to help and teach me. The relationship did not really include traditional romance, but we spent significant time together in nonsexual settings, He taught me many things, most of which had nothing to do with sex. He was much older, 25 years. However, I enjoyed his consistent attention, and never felt ignored. I am very insecure and tend to need constant reassurance of love and affection, which can be conveyed physically. Control was exercised in the entire relationship, not just the romantic portion, and ideally I would like to experience that again. 

Anyway, I think I have given a brief overview of what I had, and would like to have again. I am not looking for something short term or casual, and don't think that this type of relationship would work under those constraints. It takes time to get to know and trust a man whom you completely surrender to, and the joy of the relationship is the entire dynamic, not just the sex.

My idea of a natural progression would be in this order:

1) Talk extensivly...people are crazy
2) Talk some more 
3) Develop a bond
4) Spend time together,,,,,this is traditionally accomplished by means of more than a few dates
5) Move into romantic territory
6) Talk some more

If any of this resonated with you, Id like to talk. If not......Have a happy Friday

Note* I have been completely honest and vulnerable and expect that in return. Also, if you sound crazy,,,,or lazy, I will not respond*

Please put something to capture my attention in the Subject line of your response

Democrat Blonde Seeks Republican for Bipartisan Fun, Your Platform or Mine

Why canvas door to door when you can just reach across the aisle? If our priorities align, and you can campaign hard and are firm in your resolve, perhaps I will yield you some of my minutes on the floor and permit you to explore my loopholes. Am not seeking donations or expecting you to sign any vows of support---honest, open dialogue, and a genuine interest in my infrastructure are enough to win my vote. As long as we do not experience a huge income gap and respect one another's environments, we should be able to build a sustainable coalition. Let's make America great again!

Fun loving, independent, happy-go-lucky, warm, witty, and wise. Refined, but not snobby. Seeking high quality male companionship to unwind with. Enjoy road trips, obscure museum pilgrimages, sharing home cooked meals and raucous conversation, performing arts, long walks and bike rides, camping, and life's little pleasures. Please don't misunderstand my opening paragraphs, I don't care what party you belong to, that's just my sense of humor.

Seeking a gentleman with a mature perspective and an open mind and heart who can hold up his end of a conversation, or enjoy silence when the moment calls for it. I've lived, and continue to live, an interesting life, have traveled the world, etc. so I don't need a man for excitement, or to save me from boredom. What I'm looking for is someone to enjoy the simple things with on weekends and vacations, some attachment without smothering. I am focused on my career and am pretty busy. No time for lengthy email correspondence, so be willing to move to phone quickly and meet soon.

No drugs, non-smoker, very light drinker, stable, US citizen. Would prefer someone with similar qualities and a positive attitude. Please be age-appropriate, not married, and live reasonably close by. FYI, I am fat (in all the right places). I mention it not because I am proud of it, but to be honest and efficient.

I am at a point in life where I am happy and satisfied, but finding a nice man to share it with would be great, but not not to the point of desperation. I can take it or leave it, because my life if full in many other ways. However, I do miss the closeness and romance a relationship can bring. 

FYI- no casual encounters, f- buddies, etc.

I'm a true believer in humor and trive on it. Yes, I do know when to be serious. In my book, laughter is medicine for the soul. I am an independent lady, but do have a place for that special man in my life. 

I would love to find a humorous, sarcastic, intelligent, loving, and romantic Caucasian man. Chemistry is important. I say that because if the chemistry is not there, it's pointless. I absolutely adore men who are outdoorsy, but yet an intellectual at the same time, rough around the edges, but sweet and loving with a romantic heart.
I'm pretty versatile and enjoy many activities. I must confess that I am not a Vogue model. I am fair skinned and plump, a size 16 , some would say fat, plus size, etc. If any if this apeals to you please reply with your bio. No worries, it does not have to be as long as mine.

I want to share in the daily activities of eating together and checking in about our days. I love to take walks, cook and dine out sometimes. I enjoy watching comedies and laughing together would be very important. 
I'm looking for a romantic professional, white gentleman who is stoic, experienced, adventurous, responsible for himself, and enjoys the outdoors, but who is bookish and plays guitar, may be, or who experiences challenges and overcame ""the Self"". This sounds very spring-like of a request, yes?:) i hope so. I'm looking for Ltr, photo and introduction, please. I'm in my 30's, shy, brown eyes, brown skinned, sexual, experienced, worldly. I have a darker side as well:) love wine, drama, travel and adventure, arts, yoga, gardening, painting; liberal, but not a friend of political correctness, rather support the truth. Beach or museum? 
Let's swap email and a recent pic, to see if there is a rapport. I'm shy so if a guy can't keep up a conversation, things will pretty much go nowhere. Then we can see about meeting for a walk, happy hour or something more interesting. I'm looking for someone I can have a deep emotional connection with. As adults you know if something is going to work out or not. Just like in real life (As opposed to the internet), very few people are compatible with each other or are, ""The One""!

Whatever happened to dating? Remember dating, getting to know a person, having little butterflies when you were going to talk to someone you liked. Or you had butterflies cause you were going to see that person. I get texting is something we all do but texting and phone calls do not qualify as dating. 

Here's what I'm looking for and I realize this is a long shot: I want one guy to date. A person who when he says he's going to show up, he shows up. Not a guy who texts me endlessly or calls me every day but never comes over. A guy who is attractive, funny, smart, loves sports, watches TV and movies, maybe he cooks, he loves to cuddle, kiss, and touch. And he understands sex isn't happening until we get to know one another. No, I don't mean after our third to eighth date. He knows how to be exclusively monogamous. He's not looking to have any more children, cause I'm done with having children. He wants to explore and share his life with me. 

About me: BBW (yes, I'm a large girl) AA, attractive, funny, intelligent, creative, and has a healthy does of skepticism. If you fit the above description, please say more than hello, face pics move to the head of the line, between 36-50 and are single or unattached--no married men please!

Have you ever had doubt or suspicion in the pit of your stomach that tells you something is off center or not right? Did you ignore it and end up regretting your stupidity for not following your gut?

I know must men probably wont admit that they have been victimized by love but Im sure there are 1 or 2 that wouldn't mind telling me about it.

It could be something that happened in the past or something you are experiencing now. How did or how are you handling it?

Do you watch her secretly text and receive calls? Does she have a passcode on her phone? Are there time lapse in her day that she conveniently brush off?

Is her neglect the reason you browse these ads? What's the remedy that you seek?

I know for a fact, I made a terrible mistake by not ending the relationship when i had a chance.

I am not looking for FWB, one night stands, etc. I am looking for someone who I can be friends with, and hopefully more will come from it.

I will not respond to emails that do not bother to tell me the basics about you (i.e. name, age, what you do, some interests). I will not respond to emails just saying ""What's up?,"" ""Are you still looking?,"" or ""Do you date (fill in race/religion/ethnicity/etc)?""

Hi there! Spring is here and my thoughts turn to my back yard and how I, once again, am not utilizing it completely. I'm somewhat of a novice when it comes to gardening but grew up with a father and brother who were (and still are) really into their gardens. Unfortunately for me they live far away from DC. 

I'm looking for a single guy who likes gardening and can teach me a thing or two about it. My back yard is pretty much a blank canvas and I could use some help/ideas on what to do with it. Tired of waiting for a spot in your community garden? Then come help me and have your own space to grow what you choose (outside of pot that is--completely NOT 420 friendly). 

I'm not picky on race/ethnicity or height, but I do ask that you be between the ages of 38-48, enjoy good conversation, employed, passionate, ambitious, funny and so on. I mean the idea is to meet a guy where things could actually work out into a real relationship.

I'd prefer that you are in the District or at least close enough where you could help with the garden if I'm out of town--wouldn't want all those delicious veggies to go to waste if I can't be there to water them in the heat of the summer.

So think about it...we meet up for a drink/coffee, see if we find each other interesting and exciting enough to move forward. We can shop for plants and supplies and reap the rewards of our hard work--grilling veggies on the bbq (along with our steaks and burgers of course) while enjoying a glass of wine or a beer, canning or pickling them, or just eating them directly from the garden.

Best case scenario we both find someone and enjoy a nice relationship. Worst case scenario we become friends who garden together. Not bad odds on either end of the coin toss. So what do you say? Come and email me! :)

**I'm a short, white, single, bbw (yes that means fat), who has multiple degrees, a lover of red wine and meat, likes to travel, learn about new people and their experiences, and who doesn't take enough advantage of living in DC. So come help me out!**

I keep getting asked what I'm looking for. So here it is: 

I'm looking for a strong, confident man. One who has his life together and is sure of himself but who also is not so macho that he can't lean on his woman every once in a while. 

I'm looking for someone who can challenge me intellectually. He's bright but not pretentious. 

Someone who works hard at getting to know me so that he can make sure I feel secure with him. 

He's someone who lets me in and even though he's a very strong man, he's not afraid to be vulnerable and transparent. 

He's a curious man. There are things about the world he wants to know so he always seeks knowledge. 

He is all these things and I am all these things. 

He's also 50-65, over 5'9"", non-smoker, social drinker, single.

Craigslist used to be a site where you could actually find decent people at one point. I assume those decent people don't log on to CL anymore. Now it's just sex addicts, drug addicts, cheating married men, bored men, men who ""catfish"", or just weird men. 

I would like to meet a guy who has his head on straight and is decent. A regular guy. Someone who is independent. Not someone who pretends to be. I can not express this enough. I WANT SOMETHING REAL! If that isn't you. DON'T waste my time or yours. 

Let's send a few emails, exchange numbers and try to meet up today. I'm looking for a relationship! 
You MUST LOVE, not like, not sort-of like, not a little bit, lol, you must love children. 
Please don't lie about your age! NEVER go into any relationship with lying. Please be at least 30 years old! No one younger. As far as race goes I love Black men, but open to other races, as long as your American born. No offense, NO HISPANICS.

About me:

I am a young African American woman, short, light skin, and easy on the eyes. I am looking for a man that is attractive, has a great sense of humor, and knows how to treat a lady. I have hsv2 so you would have to be comfortable with that.

So, if your interested we can get to know each other.

I am not looking for a one night stand, I am not looking for pics of your genitals, I am not looking for a father (so if your over 40 keep it moving), and I am not looking for a crazy stalker. If I don't respond to your message It's simply because I'm not interested.
No pic No response. It's that simple.

Almost 99% of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. Only about 0.85% is composed of another five elements: potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium. And we are all unique.
Attractive female (inside and out) seeks man of intelligence and depth.

I seek a WM, 56+ to 69 who is enjoying life and accepts that reality is your friend.

If there is a man reading this who has a healthy outlook & would like some female companionship Sunday for lunch or a movie, write to me. I'd be delighted to hear from you.

I am a SWF.

I am an interesting woman.
I only wish to hear from mature men who seek a multidimensional relationship based on depth, intellectual attraction, compatibility and a tactile component.

If you are, maybe we have something to talk about. I'm a single 41 year old female. I'm a professional, very active physically and completely self-supporting. I'm intelligent and have a great sense of humor that tends toward the sarcastic. I love physical sports - from sky-diving to Irish dancing - so you should too. I'm very attractive - something I share because, contrary to romantic lore, looks do matter. If you're not a liberal, keep on skimming the ads. If you're just looking for someone for sex, move on to the next ad because I'm looking for romance, friendship, companionship and maybe even love. 

Interested? Well, if you're single, want a monogamous relationship, you're employed or retired, and you found yourself nodding your head thinking that you want the same things I do, then please reply and tell me about yourself (in actual English sentences). And please send a recent picture of your face (no dick pics). We both know looks matter and, if I think we should keep talking I'll send you back one of me with my answer to your email.

Hello there...single black professional female...slightly awkward and quite a bit of an introvert...that really craves and misses the companionship of a man. I've been on the dating scene for a couple of years and I'd love more than anything to go on my last first date. While I'd love to meet my life partner, for now, I know it starts with a laugh, a glass of wine, a dance, a kiss...the small but fun stuff.

I love to laugh, I enjoy dancing and live music, I appreciate the small stuff, and I am thrilled when I get to spend a day relaxing at home. I am by no means perfect, I have flaws, I won't pretend to be an amazing super model. I'm cute, quirky, and curvy, and I come complete with a nice long list of flaws. lol. But who doesn't...right?

I would love to meet a laid back guy that has a great sense of humor, is somewhat a smart ass, loves simplicity, has a kind heart, is NOT MARRIED/ATTACHED, and is interested in being an amazing friend and possible partner. I love kids, so if you have kids, great! I'm also looking to relocate soon so I'm open to location. 

Bonus if you like a chick with braces. lol. I know...who likes a grown woman with with braces? Well...if you do, I'm your girl! HAHA!

However, as an important side note, I have hsv. If that's a problem, please do not respond. I'm just being respectful of people's right to make their own decisions, since I was not given that choice ;-)

It would be awesome if you include something about yourself in your response, not just like...one or two words or ""how you doing"". I'd be glad to exchange pics as we chat further.

You should have the time for a relationship in your life right now. If you're married to your work, we won't be a good match. This is a long-term offer for a commitment, not something that you want to do on an occasional weekend.
I will always treat you with respect, compassion and consideration, and I expect that you will treat me the same way. I'm an affectionate woman and need a man who can match that. But we have to get there first.

You should be 33-44, white, college educated, intelligent, employed, healthy, in a very good shape, DDF, able to hold a decent conversation and have your life together.
I seek a patient man who knows how to enjoy his life, have fun and has a spark.
I tend to relate well to confident men who have had a relevant relationship experience.
I prefer clean-shaven men because I have a very soft skin.
I'm very selective because I know my worth.

I'm not interested in FWB, NSA, please don't contact me with such offers.

Please be local to me, preferably in Maryland, and include your location, marital status and schedule.

No smoking, excessive drinking or cats.
Please provide face pics and the necessary details. Writing something meaningful in your response is the best way to get noticed.

I'm looking to become friends first, going to museums, hiking, concerts, matinees together.

Gentlemen,

Have a car question and need some honest advise please, though I realize this is your Opinion and you are not an 'expert' on this so just share what you think as a man who owns a car in MD.

I got the MD vehicle emissions inspection Notice that is due soon.

My 2003 Camry has an issue and I'm not sure if this can/would cause me to fail this inspection. If it might I'll want to get this fixed b/f I go to have the emission test done.
Issue is car ignition requires a little juggling before it starts car.

When I put the key in starter/ignition and turn it, I simply have to juggle the steering wheel and the key a little more than before this developed to get car to start. And, it does always start.
Someone said I may just need a new key made. I have no clue what has caused this to develop.
Your thoughts are appreciated. Have you ever had this issue?
SWF happy to meet a man in my age range seeking a GF.

Thanks

If we all wore a truthful sign that says how we really are inside would any of us take the time to talk and get to know each other?

Yes we all want a person that is attractive, but there is so much more to each and everyone of us. I want a black gentleman that is attractive, but more than that it is all about how you treat people, and the person that you are and if we can get along with each other. I want a gentleman that has more to him than Looks, and Good In Bed, those qualities are not hard to come by. Please be over 51 years old. One more thing in closing.

am a smart, polyamorous, kinky, sex positive, zaftig (bbw?) -- a beauty seeking an intelligent, positive, and open minded man for playtime, dating, and possible ltr or long term fwb.

I am polyamorous. Not monogamous. Not cheating. I have a partner who consents to my seeking another. 

Be 28-48, d&d free, ggg, non smoker. 

Well written replies with pics get more attention. As do those with prior real time experience with dd/lg and bdsm. 

Be someone who is kind but strong, smart & sexy but funny, caring but sadistic (when needed). You should be willing and able to respect my limits but push my envelope. You should have a good deal of Creativity and imagination in your style of kinky play. A good Dominant or top to me, just needs a good pair of strong hands, the capacity for empathy, and a good mind. 
You should be interested in a dynamic marked by variety and depth of feeling-- sometimes i crave to be spread out, restrained, and used while others i need you to brush my hair and tuck me in. 

I am interested in being in service and giving pleasure as much as I am interested in being a canvas for my daddy's sadistic and sensual skills.

Hi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once upon this time in a land not so far away, lives a strong willed, smart, sweet, kind, faithful, honest, caring, funny, and sometimes gooberiffic Princess named ""Fiona"". She is 44yrs old, a good cook/baker, homebody, movie lover, enjoys sports, and is a wonderful Mother/Nana. For the most part she is happy and content with her life, but often she misses the companionship of a great relationship. So she has been searching for quite some time now for her ""Shrek"". A guy who's nowhere near perfect, because she too has flaws. But he without a doubt is kind, compassionate, family oriented, funny, honest, faithful and easy going. When they meet they will both know it's right, because they will find each others minds, and quirks in sync and attractive to one other. Then they will live, love and laugh together happily ever after....hopefully!!

It's time to go out and explore the city. How about a Nats game, dinner at Fiola Mare, a show at a Wolf Trap, or a round of golf? Sounds exciting?

You must be a witty, established, courteous gentleman with a great sense of humor. You should know how to treat a lady properly and make sure her needs are taken care of (not just physically). I prefer mature gentlemen.

I am a charming, funny, exotic, buxom beauty with alluring eyes and a gorgeous smile. I enjoy sports, fine dining, live events, and travel.

If this strikes your fancy, please respond with ""spring "" in the subject, a brief introduction of yourself and a recent photo (no nudes, please).

Take care! :)

Seems to be same o same around here, scrolling through the M4W posts is like eating molded potato chips and drinking a flat Pepsi. Every other post claims to either be the ""last honest man,"" or to ""just"" be ""looking for love"" (+ all these other additionals )...Just about every post claims to be a ""handsome"" or ""attractive"" male...Never really dawned on me until I started looking at Craigslist...But men who so freely describe themselves as ""handsome"" and ""attractive""...weird me out...for some reason...Maybe there isn't any logic behind that...it just is weird to me (but I'm weird, so could just be a clash of weirdness).

Maybe it's just the whole ""putting oneself in a box"" concept...maybe that's what has me feeling all funny. Everybody seems to be trying to build a ten-foot round house, in a 4-foot square box...All these claims of wanting love...when all you're after is sex and feel-good feelings. All these claims about being honest...when you're just about saying what you feel in the way that will hurt people the most and get the most attention...All this talk of being a great catch and bragging about this and about that...Why take the car salesman approach (no offense to actual car sales people...just sayin')...I'm not a child, you're not a child...why play the manipulation game to sell me...you...

Where are the real people...Real as in just transparent and sincere in what they say and what they do...and what they want...Where are the people who really want what they say they want...We all have our preferences, me, you and that weird looking guy in the corner (yeah, you)...But where are the real people...

I'm looking for someone who is looking for a serious LTR. Someone that can be my best friend. I am a 35yr old wf looking for a wm 30-50. Looking for a non-smoker.
About me: I'm average, 5'1"", natural brown curly hair (I wear straight alot), very easy going and simple. I tend to lean more towards nerdy guys but am willing to get to know anyone. I like spending time at home more then going out. When I go out, it's w/ my significant other and it's doing something like eating out or walking around the mall. I don't like bars, partying, guys w/ 500 friends that call them non-stop. I'm not a teenager and I'm not looking for someone who wants to act like one. I have 2 small children and I'm looking for someone who LOVES kids and would love mine as thier own. I also have quite a few cats who are like my children also and very spoiled! SO you MUST love cats. I'm a clean freak so I want someone that prefers keeping things clean as well. I like guys who are not lazy and can be handy with things but still likes to relax too! I love watching TV/movies, playing board games, and even video games. I'm a simple person like I said and prefer someone who likes those kind of simple things. 
I love snuggling, I love being loved. I am an honest, devoted person who is looking for someone who can be faithful and is 100% honest. I am super family oriented and love visiting my parents on the weekend near Annapolis. I grew up fishing, crabbing, camping, hunting and love the outdoors so if you are an outdoors person and love these things that's a bonus! I love pizza, I love watching crime shows and horror movies, I volunteer w/ cat rescue, I love crafty things, I love going to yard sales, I love anything Disney, I love the holidays especially Xmas!!! I own my home but it's small and not a good school area and really want to get out of this area soon. 

I have goals and I need the extra special someone in my life so I can truly be happy. I'm happy that I have my kids and I love them so much. I truly hope there is someone out there.

Your picture gets mine.

We only learn how to act in public.

Not looking for anything serious - lacking some testosterone in my life. Preferably someone who's more of a ""guys"" guy, good with his hands, quick on his feet, a fondness for beer and the ability to get along with pretty much anyone. Someone who has a strong personality with an open mind, but will still let others voice their perspectives/opinions without making them feel inadequate -- followed by a decent sense of humor. I'm more of a homebody and prefer the sports bar over a club any day. Drama, inconsistency and disloyalty are not tolerated. 

A few tidbits about me: loud laugher, messy cook (always looking for new guinea pigs), soft spot for good beer, mixed kid, opinionated but sincere, fiercely loyal and an inimitable friend with an addiction to chocolate. 

Interested in a round?

I am a lightskin black bbw and you must be happy with that.  I am looking for a monogamous FLR for possible LTR. I have always been naturally assertive and I'm finally trying to embrace that about myself.  I'm not here to educate you on what this type of relationship is, the Internet can do that.  I'm looking for the devotion, loyalty, and respect of this type of relationship more than the kink. 

I am a normal girl who is funny, intelligent, caring, considerate, thoughtful,  romantic, and educated. I am drug and disease free. I am a full time professional so I'm not looking to be supported nor am I looking to support anyone.  

I'm looking for an unattached man who is between 28-40, educated, professional, caring, gentle,  attractive, considerate, romantic, slim, fit, medium build. A man that believes women should be catered to like the goddess they were born to be. I am short but do prefer taller men (over 5'10). The ideal man would be self sufficient in his daily life but prefer to cater to his woman. So alpha male at work and sub for me. He must be drug and disease free, non smoker, completely unattached, and serious about this lifestyle.  My preference is someone who has tried this before and can teach me more about it while growing with me. I'll be honest I am very interested in interracial dating but I don't like to exclude anyone. 

Reply with ""goddess"" in the subject, tell me about yourself, and add a picture. No catfish please or anyone afraid to meet in person. The more effort in the response the more likely I am to respond. Yes I am a real person.

I don't understand why people do not have the courage to be honest. I learned the man I was with is married. He lied to me. Why lie? How can people develop a relationship with lies? I am surrounded by liars and cheats and wonder why bother lying and cheating as the truth always comes out? I see so many married men who don't want to leave for whatever reason. I give those men credit; at least they are honest. The men who lie is just deceitful. Hurtful. When the wife finds out she is hurt, when the girlfriend finds out she is hurt, when the man is caught, he is like oh crap!
My faith in humanity and decency is shattering away. I am sure others feel the same. The ones who enter a relationship with the best intentions to be honest and treat their partner with respect.
I wonder if there are any men who experienced a betrayal and lies and asked themselves why? Why dangle a person like a puppet?
Today is a new day. . .
I would love to read something funny 

The good news? I'm youthful for my age, sane, drama free, cheerful, affectionate and have a quirky sense of humor. I'm independent, practical, rational, successful, sensual, financially sound, and I have a job that I love. I'm self-confident, unpretentious and not even remotely depressed. I'm nice to children and cute furry animals. I get excited about new restaurants, interesting TV shows/movies and good books. I care about certain world issues, and I don't give a hoot about many others. 

The bad news? I don't suffer fools gladly and I don't put up with uncourtious or inconsiderate behavior. I am sometimes stubborn and impatient. I can be too independent (or so I'm told), and though I don't like narcissism or arrogance in a man, I also tend not to do well with those who are insecure and lack self-confidence. I can sustain glamorous for a few hours, but I'm usually more of a Girl-Next-Door type. And for God's sake, of course I'm not ""as comfortable in an evening gown as in blue jeans."" 

Physically I am tall, average build (not toned but not fat or obese either). I've got blue eyes, long hair and a pretty smile. 

I'm an empty nester WF, divorced, non-smoker, social drinker, who says what she means and does what she says. I am looking for similar characteristics in a local man who is interested in a relationship. I am interested in men of all races, age 46 or older and who live a reasonable distance to me (in rush hour traffic). Extra points if you are interesting, intelligent, attractive and available as defined below: 

Interesting -- Tell me what interests you? Can you pose an interesting question for me in your response that catches my attention? 
Intelligent -- You don't have to have lots of college degrees, but I want a man who communicates well, both verbally and in writing. Now is your chance to show me the latter. 
Attractive -- For me, that means tall (5'10"" or taller), average, stocky, or muscular build. Well groomed (bald or shaved head is a plus) and a great smile. 
Available -- No married men or otherwise in a relationship. And - if you have young children in your life, or a demanding or weird scheduled job that limits your ability to have a normal dating (emotional and physical) relationship - pass me by.

Serious replies only please. And yes I am real. I picked Villanova for the winner of my bracket.

Has it been a long week already for you too? For some reason yesterday and today were two of the longest, most difficult days I have had to get through in quite some time. I even brought work home... sigh.... but I am looking for a pleasant distraction since it's not gym night tonight. With the sun and blue skies today, I started to think that maybe I should meet someone new and see whether there is someone out there fun, intelligent, attractive enough to hang out with and explore the DMV this Spring and beyond?! 

I know there are a lot of skeptics on Craigslist - I can assure I am a real woman. I am attractive, intelligent, witty. I am not crazy or insane - just fun and adventurous and can be goofy too. I have a hard time meeting decent, respectable, honest guys who know who they are and are not just looking for an ""FWB"" or casual thing. I have an amazing career and position that I worked hard to achieve and am not willing to give that up for something superficial. 

Are you a normal, decent, attractive, age appropriate, single, intelligent, honest guy looking for similar qualities in a woman? If you are a traveller and a music fan - you get extra bonus points!
Use an adjective to describe the type of day you had and put it in the subject line so I know you are real and please send a photo of yourself (not your penis) if you want to hear back from me. There are a lot of crazies on here and I need to see who I would be chatting with. I'll send you back one if we connect.

In my late 40s I finally found the courage to leave my job as a graphic designer and pursue my passion for food. It was part of a long maturing process that also involved creating a healthy distance between myself and my emotionally crippled family. My interest in nutrition soon led to an excitement about cooking and eventually to my becoming a health-oriented personal chef. My individuation from my family and their white-bread-and-mayonnaise values has led to the discovery of myself as a person who is willing to feel deeply, act boldly and think creatively. I want to be with a man who has also become his own person, who considers life an adventure and who has time for romance, intimacy and me.

In my work I help others cook better, host cooking/dinner parties, and cater dinner parties. I'm interested in exploring the science as well as practicing the art of cooking. It would be be great to be with someone who enjoys food and who likes to be the kitchen but I'm capable of being drawn into your world as well if you truly love what you do.

A good match for me is someone who . . ..

...wants to make a difference (big or small scale).
. . .is happy to take the scenic route to just about anywhere
. . .is charmed by down-in-the valley views just as much as bird's-eye vistas.
. . .wants to explore the world --cultures and history-- through food and people, cities and the countryside
....likes to be active, has all-day energy.


Religion has no appeal to me - but I'm definitely intrigued with ""spirituality"" (am using this for a lack of a better word). Meaning to say, I'm interested in understanding that what's there but cannot be seen.

Community involvement is important to me, I'm active with the South Bay sustainable food movement. Will soon start a two-year term as president of a nonprofit.

Friends? Family? Kids? I have several very close friends, and consider them my family. I raised 4 step children with ex husband in the 90s/early 00s.

Still have my full-suspension mtn bike, panniers, snorkel, backpack, sleeping bag, downhill ski equipment, X-country ski boots, snowshoes. ...and want to do all these activities with a partner,

Eventually, I want to golf, have really enjoyed it the couple of times I've played. And I want to play the piano again, and ride a horse again. I would love to be a good singer and hope to someday take lessons, bonus if I find someone who likes to sing (together). And I love to dance ... the waltz, tango, swing. I'm not one who needs perfection, just enjoyment in a shared activity.

Love yoga, hiking, once or twice a week. I run, occasionally. I like to bike and hope you are ok with me --a slow poke-- some distance behind you. I actually like to fish (shore or boat --jigging, casting, slabbing), I don't have the gear or make a point of going, but will definitely join my partner.

I thoroughly enjoy concerts and live theater; not much of a fan of opera or spectator sports.

I'm exploring and expanding my emotional range with those who are close to me.. It feels like the key to getting the most out of life.

Looking for an unattached guy that's ready to open up and learn to love, honor and respect a young beautiful woman.

I have no time for games or drama, so please don't message me with a negative spirit. I love having fun and enjoying the beautiful spring weather. This isnt a solicitation for intimacy, sex or a hook up.

Theres much more to a relationship than those things. however i do recognize their importance. But be forewarned that if you come at me in any disrespectful manner you have no chance at all.

Would love to meet a guy that believes in chivalry and humbleness. Someone that identifies with what it means to be a gentleman first and foremost.

More than anything im looking for a good friend thats willing to develop a foundation of trust and respect.

If you have interest in patiently taking the time and energy to get to know me then please feel free and introduce yourself.

Please no Hello, How are you, text me, send a pic, what you doing, are you real, where you at, do you want to come over. Be a real man and act as if you are attempting to enter the life of a goddess because im not your typical craigslist female.

Show some manners and try and elevate your consciousness to a level a woman can respect and be intrigued by. 

Most women my age are turned on mentally, emotionally and eventually sexually by men that have a sense of dignity, class and humanity.

I understand that many men have no clue as to how to properly introduce themselves on that level.

So i am anxiously awaiting those that no know other way but respect for a young woman.

thanks for your time... please put your favorite past time in the subject to help me eliminate spam.

As I was shopping in the grocery store, I felt the extreme urge to cook a pan-seared tuna on a bed of baby field greens with a sesame aioli sauce and of course with red wine. Of course, I am also that girl who will only cook a meal like that for a man who has shown me more love than I can show in return through words or kisses. So I cook. And of course I had no one to cook that meal for. No man to cuddle up next to after the meal and just talk and drink tea.

Ok so now that we all know I can cook. So here is a bit about who I am: I am a woman who will always keep your interests piqued intellectually, sensually, and spiritually.A few other things you might want to keep in mind before you decide to respond to this particular post. I do have 1 piercing (5 points if you can guess where it is!!!). I am open minded and adventurous in and out of bed. I love to laugh. I have soft brown skin and curves (yes sweetie I have pictures to prove it). My favorite desserts are cheesecake and flan. I am extremely active and highly educated.

I love so many things in life...travel, fine dining, great movies (comedies and action), board games, creating beautiful things, my favorite drinks are scotch, red wine, and tequila; I enjoy live shows, I love music (classic rock, oldies, country, classical) and I am all about devotion, loyalty, and being fully engrossed with only one wonderful man. I want to spend my time loving on you, cooking for you, and taking care of you in every way you desire.

My man should expect to have all of his needs met at all times by his woman who is genuinely happy to do so. I am attentive, affectionate, respectful, and honest when I agree to date a man because, if I am with him, I have decided that he is the type of man I can look up to and trust to care for me. My man should expect to have a woman who agrees with him the majority of the time and gently corrects when necessary. He should expect a cheerleader who is there when he needs someone. He should expect to be treated like a god and be looked at with eyes of love and adoration.

My physical traits: Brown skin, mid-thirties, great attitude and fabulous personality. Easy to get along with, non-judgmental, open, and incredibly loving. I'm a bit of a bad girl so be prepared for some outside-of-the-box habits. I also have a very good heart....lucky you :)

I am happy to trade photos after building a rapport with you. If you think we have common desires and I am the type of woman you would be happy to have in your life right now, I would love to meet for a drink and see if we have that initial attraction to one another. 

Ok so things about you. Mmm well I am most attracted to white guys so that being said I would prefer a white guy who had dated inter-racially before or who is very interested in it. I dont particularly care if you have tattoos or not. You must take care of yourself. Preferably college educated. You must be looking for a relationship...not just a cute friend with a warm hole. No older than 55 and no younger than 34. Confidence is the sexiest thing a man can be.

That said, I have never been the type of girl to shy away from a challenge! What have I got to lose?

Or so it seems!

There is a lot of spam and ridiculousness to weed through on this site.

So I will keep this on point. I am a single gal looking to date leading to a meaningful relationship. I am educated, employed, pay my taxes, worldly, cultured, witty, sassy, genuine, no BS type. I am average height but Above average weight, on the fat side, size 14/16, proportionate feminine figure, healthy, active, alluring smile, nice dark eyes and hair. sensual, mixed ethnicity, mediterranean looks and considered attractive.

You be 100% single or 100%divorced, No children of your own, between 32-40 only, local, educated, intelligent, gainfully employed, very independent, respectful, chivalrous, law abiding, healthy, non drug user or smoker except for caffeine, moderate drinking and/or the occasional/rare hookah or cigar. I am open to all ethnicities, it's about the attraction and compatibility for me. However, i am not into excessive tattoos or piercings or anyone shorter than 5'9. No offense.

If you are attached, or don't have time/energy/true intent to date, do NOT contact me.

If you are actually serious, straight forward, honest, looking to actually date someone and ALL the above applies, then get in touch with some information about you and a recent photo.

I will not respond to one word or one line emails or canned responses. No need to waste your time or mine. I am 100% real there was a significant event in Brussels recently.

Good luck

Another weekend is here and I hope you have something fun planned this weekend. I have with my family like I normally do most weekends, however something was different this time. I miss being a couple. I miss sharing a smile or an inside joke with that special someone. I miss the hand holding and sharing an embrace. Having gone through a horrible breakup last year the kind that wrecks your world and sends you in to a free fall. I decided to take some time off from dating. I needed to heal, I needed to find my happy place, I needed to find me and what I wanted. I'm finally in a place where I am happy again and the eternal optimistic that I am is hopeful about life and love. I am sure you're wondering ""why Craigslist of all places?"" Well I am not much in to bars or the club scene these days. I work with kids and most everyone in my life is either married or coupled off. Do you ever get tired of being the third wheel?? I am!! I know this is a crazy chance to take but a few years ago I adopted my amazing dog from here and maybe I am hoping that this site well serve me well this time around as well.

I would love to meet someone between the ages of 32 and 42. I know age is just a number to some people but I want to be able to relate to the person I am with. I myself am 34 and have never been married nor do I have any kids. I personally don't care if you have kids or have been married before. As long as you have little or no drama in your life we'll be fine. I am only interested in dating Caucasian males. I hope you understand that this is a preference of mine and not a prejudice. Being that this is CL after all I must stress that I am NOT looking for a friend with benefits or a one night stand. If you send me pictures of your junk I will post it on the male for male section of CL with all your contact information :-)

I hope you take a chance and send me an email. While I am not brave enough to post a picture on here I have tons of them and will happily send you one with my reply. Replies with pictures will get the most preference. It's always nice to see who I'm emailing. Take a chance and let's be brave! We might be completely wrong for each other or completely right. Take a leap of faith with me. The only regrets we have in life are the risks we never took :-)

If you have a very narrow world view or you never been outside your town, then we probably won't get along.

You MUST be single or divorced, have NO children of your own, american born or lived here a very long time, between 31-40 (no exceptions), no drugs or criminal activities, educated, professional, very independent, respectful and actually serious and looking for a real relationship.

I am average in height, on the curvy and fat side, size 16, feminine figure, mediterranian looks, alluring, and attractive.

Serious emails with details and pic only. Include all the basics like age, stats, a little background, etc... No time for games, liars or fakes. Do not waste your time or mine. 

If this is still up, then I am still looking.

Peace!

ARE YOU READY FOR THE RELATIONSHIP YOU DESERVE?

Most of our clients didn't think online dating was for them before working with us. They said it was too intimidating, too time-consuming, too overwhelming. ""It's a numbers game,"" they said.

Maybe you feel the same and, like them, want to find love. But... 

Finding a relationship with someone worthy of your heart isn't easy.

You've created a life you love -- a successful career, a sophisticated lifestyle, a grounded sense of self -- but you haven't met anyone worth sharing it with yet. You're at a place in life where your friends have partnered up, and you're left unmatched. 

Meeting a partner who complements you is a priority, but the options in your social circle are limited.

Whether you've just signed your divorce papers and are unsure of the nuances of modern dating, or have concentrated on developing your career while your love life sat on the back burner, one thing is certain: dating hasn't been your focus.

I have posted on here before and find myself ending up with a gchat buddies. I am looking for someone who wants to meet up and go out on a date and see what can happen, I am looking for someone who is single (no offense to the married men, but I am not looking to help you have an affair) and is interested in wanting to date.

If it is important to you, I am 5'3 brown hair, hazel eyes, Jewish (its somewhat important to me) and on the bigger/curvier side of the body spectrum. I do have pictures and would be more than happy to send you one after receiving one of you,

If any of this has caught your eye than email me, whats the harm? I would appreciate you send me an email with something about my ad that stood out to you and a little bit about yourself. Who knows what you can find out there in craigslist land?

You read my title correctly. It says ""Ol skool lovin""
This modern day dating world is a total hot disastrous mess. People text instead of call, on social media during dates, men don't open doors for his date, etc...
Just not enough etiquette, respect or getting to know each other properly. 

So with that said, I would enjoy the company of an Black man who is courteous, chivalrous, well spoken, and enjoys life. The kind of man who still enjoys a big home cooked Sunday dinner.

If he is into oldies but goodies, that is a plus. Someone who wants the companionship of a good woman who will treat him the man/King he is.

If he is religious, WE WILL NOT WORK.
Spiritual, Conscious, Knowledge of Self, Knowledge of Black History, is a plus.

As for myself, I'm in my late 40's very attractive, non smoker, non drinker, non club/party going woman. I live a peaceful and quiet life and I'm drama free.

Hello there...single black professional female...slightly awkward and quite a bit of an introvert...that really craves and misses the companionship of a man. I've been on the dating scene for a couple of years and I'd love more than anything to go on my last first date. While I'd love to meet my life partner, for now, I know it starts with a laugh, a glass of wine, a dance, a kiss...the small but fun stuff.

I love to laugh, I enjoy dancing and live music, I appreciate the small stuff, and I am thrilled when I get to spend a day relaxing at home. I am by no means perfect, I have flaws, I won't pretend to be an amazing super model. I'm cute, quirky, and curvy, and I come complete with a nice long list of flaws. lol. But who doesn't...right?

I would love to meet a laid back guy that has a great sense of humor, is somewhat a smart ass, loves simplicity, has a kind heart, is NOT MARRIED/ATTACHED, and is interested in being an amazing friend and possible partner. I love kids, so if you have kids, great! I'm also looking to relocate soon so I'm open to location. 

Bonus if you like a chick with braces. lol. I know...who likes a grown woman with with braces? Well...if you do, I'm your girl! HAHA!

However, as an important side note, I have hsv. If that's a problem, please do not respond. I'm just being respectful of people's right to make their own decisions, since I was not given that choice ;-)

It would be awesome if you include something about yourself in your response, not just like...one or two words or ""how you doing"". I'd be glad to exchange pics as we chat further.

I think I'd be a great catch for someone. I'm an attractive, divorced mom, great job, honest, loyal, and just happy in general. Went through a rough divorce, but used it as a learning opportunity, not an excuse to get angry at men. I don't need someone to complete me or my life...I'm looking for that one special person to enhance it!! I have a wonderful relationship with my child, who lives with me primarily. Although my life is not perfect, it's pretty damned good, and I have no good excuse to complain. 

In my free time, I enjoy doing all sorts of things. Movies, bowling, playing pool, dancing, just hanging out and people watching! There are so many great museums around here that I love to go to, and there are too many day trip spots around to list! I think when shared with the right company, almost anything can be fun. Just have to find the right company!

I'm looking for a single or divorced white male, preferably between 40 - 55, who lives within 30 minutes of the NOVA area. I'm not looking for something casual; please be interested in finding something that will hopefully lead to a long term relationship! No games and no drama, please!!! If you and the truth are not close friends, please don't respond. 

So....any interest? If you'd like to talk a little more, please respond with a little bit about yourself and enclose a picture. I'll send a picture of myself back in return. No picture and/or no note gets no response....sorry.

Hope to talk soon!

What do I want? Someone who likes my body. Someone who wants to-- no, who can't help but touch it. I want it long and hard and rough but slow until it is impossible to be slow. Your breath in my ear, your hands on my hips, the sound of you saying my name. 

I want connection and passion. Not necessarily a boyfriend. But not just a casual one-time fuck, either. We'll exchange a few emails. Meet in a public location. Go back to your place? If there is chemistry. I want to make out for hours. I want your hand around my throat, on my breast, gripping my ass. I want your respect and attention.

Good morning everyone!

I had a fwb that moved, and we had a great time together. Basically, I'm looking for a replacement. Not looking for a one time thing. He was over 8"" and nice and thick, so I'm hoping my luck will strike twice. I'm open to it developing into something more, and this shouldn't feel extremely casual. Hence posting in this section. 

Please reply with a picture, age, height, and location. You should be SINGLE, between ages 23 and 45, DDF, and into curvy full-figured black women. Change the subject to BWC to help me with spam!

Happy Sunday :)

Hello!

While I realize a list of attributes doesn't give off an open-minded type of person, I also know from past experiences people I am more likely to bond with. So while I'm not bound fast to these ideals, here are some things I strongly prefer: college education, non-smoker, social drinker, not previously divorced, no children but wants them one day, somewhere in your 30s, not allergic to pets, has a car, no criminal history (okay, maybe a speeding ticket!) honest, and affectionate. Oh, and blue eyes are helpful :-)

A bit about me- graduate degree, teacher, non-smoker, enjoy traveling, honest to a fault, love pets, lived abroad.

I have pictures to share and expect the same. Tell me about yourself in your response. I won't reply unless you've at least put a little effort in!

I know this is Craig's list so I am not expecting much.......

Here is the gist of everything that is going on.......I am 23 years old black and indian, full time college student, work part time, have my own place and car. Single with no kids. I have everything together. I am independent and intelligent. Though that is the case I need help with a few things still and yet.

I plan on joining the air force and I have scored relatively high but the reason why I have not officially joined yet is because I need to lose weight. I used to be an athlete in high school so you would think it wouldn't be hard for me but it has been.....

Honestly I am looking for someone to invest in me. What I mean by that is, I need help like anyone but given who I am, I am not seeking to use or abuse anyone. I simply need a mentor. Someone who may want to physically turn me into their ideal. Yes that means cosmetic surgeries or not. It all depends. Through helping me lose all the weight I would be beyond grateful and you will be cherished. 

We can come up with an agreement of some sort if that makes you feel comfortable. My thing is I have so much to offer but I feel like I have not been given the opportunity to be the best I can be. I have a big heart. I am a sensual, thoughtful, compassionate and hypersexual person. I am easy going, down to earth, and I love to laugh and I love to love and be loved. I am a rare kind of young lady. 

If you are interested in my proposition and would like to know more please reply. I don't mind giving my number so that we can talk more on it. Yes I prefer to talk over text.

I want to, but I can't... yet. 

So...

I've been surfing the CE section of CL, and I have to say - some of you have some VERY pretty penises. They make me want to come right over and fuck you blind.

But for whatever reason, I haven't done that yet. And I'm starting to think, the problem is... YOU.

Now obviously, your first thought may be ""HEY, I've gotten plenty of action from this. I don't have to change a damn thing."" And you're right, you don't have to change at all.

However, from what I've read, the overall response for males is rather low (compared to the number of responses a woman would get if she posted a CE ad for men), and many of the responses you receive are ""bots."" So maybe you should take heed to this message.

I'm going to help you improve your marketing strategy.

First of all, you need to understand your both your current market AND your untapped market (or, your TOTAL market.) For every woman that's down and has no problem answering your current ad, there has to be at least one or more that has not answered an ad. We're looking, we're appreciating, and we have the desire (wet panties, rubbing one out after the parade of penises on our laptops), yet we can't seem to take that step to contact you. Clearly your current market strategy is not generating new business. You are so focused on retention of current clients that you've neglected to look for ways to drive new business to your market. And increasing your client base is essential to success.

So how do you drive new business? Diversify your marketing.

Most businesses have a combination of marketing tactics - internet, print, tv/radio, etc. Now clearly, I'm not suggesting that you take out print or tv/radio ads to get some ass. This is online, and online it will stay. However, you can diversify your MESSAGE. This way it will reach multiple audiences. Did you even consider that your ONE ad could be multifaceted and appeal to a wide range of women? It can. And let's face it, women are NOTHING if not multifaceted. So, not only would you be appealing to a wider range of women, you would also be appealing to the many sides of each woman. Pause and think about that....
Diversifying your message could (will) lead to a larger market share (more sexual opportunities - to be exact.)

Let me explain how to diversify your message to reach women who want to take the plunge into the wonderful world of CE, but haven't yet.

Sexual - Despite what many believe, women ARE sexual, and you need to appeal to that side of us. You have. The penis pic is great! That's sexual, it's a turn on. It reminds us of what this ad is really about, and trust, if we weren't about that, we wouldn't be perusing CE. And I need the penis pic, because if I'm going to step out, it better be worth my time. :)

But there are some other parts that you have missed. And I've noticed, the prettier the penis, the worse the ad. Sadly, the best ads are from men with no pics. But as I said, I LIKE the penis pic.

Romantic - Many of you are missing this. Your penis pic is accompanied by a raunchy message. Is that necessary? Wasn't the pic of your penis sufficient to convey sexual/raunchy? Why not try to offset the penis pic with some flowery words of prose. I'm not suggesting that you turn this into an LTR ad; casual sex is casual sex. But make us newbies feel a little less shame at the thought of answering such an ad. Instead of ""Let me put my rock hard cock into your pussy and blow a 7 day load"" (disgusting), why not try, ""I haven't had the company of a woman in a while and I would appreciate the opportunity to share a mutually fulfilling sexual experience, NSA."" And it's ok to get a little descriptive, but make it the type of descriptive that appeals to WOMEN, not men. This makes us newbies feel a little less like pros, and more like women with natural urges seeking an opportunity to satisfy them. Then we can say to ourselves, ""It's not dirty, it's NATURAL....""

Intellectual - For fuck's sake, USE PROPER SPELLING AND GRAMMAR. It will be a cold day in hell before I answer an ad from a man who can't write. I may not be looking for an LTR, but I don't want to feel embarrassed by whom I've let into my vagina. When you write well, instead of feeling ""You just gave it up to a random stranger,"" I can tell myself that we are ""two intelligent people entering into a mutually beneficial short-term relationship."" And I, and many other women, need that. Listen, it's not our fault. We've been taught from birth that our ""flower"" is special and should not be given away to just anyone. Help us get past this, make us feel like we haven't sunk to rock-bottom by perusing CE ads. We don't want to date you, we just want to feel good about fucking you.

And let's take a moment to discuss truth in advertising. I tend to look for the word ""safe."" (Although I'm not stupid. Any CE with a random stranger is already falling a tad short of safe.) You say you're DD free. I read that, but I would be a fool if I believed that unquestioningly. If I decide to take the plunge, I want to be sure that I'm as safe as I can be. Most of you SAY safe, but you clearly don't mean it. How do I know??? Well...
You mention safe, but in the same ad, you want me to take a mouthful cum, or you want to cum in my face.
You want me to be open to not using a condom.
Or my favorite, the ad that says ""I'm safe"" then shows pics with women with cum all over her vagina. Sooo, since you came all around it instead of inside, THAT'S SAFE? That's a potential for disease AND BABIES!
All of the above makes me wonder ""Does this man even know what safe MEANS?"" (which takes us back to intellectual - clearly missing.)

FYI - Safe is:
Intercourse with a condom.
Fellatio with a condom
Cunnilingus with a dental dam - and YES, I am safe, but you don't know that for certain.
And I'd feel better about being with you if you suggested the above. I don't know the CORRECT status of you, or the last person you fucked from your ad. Yeah, I read what you wrote, but sometimes, occasionally, every once in a while, people LIE. Yeah, I'm a cynical bitch.
So if you aren't doing these things, you aren't really SAFE. You lack truth in advertising, an FTC violation. And while the FTC isn't patrolling CL, you are possibly losing potential business as safety is a feature that is attractive to the untapped market!

I know, I know. Safe's not fun - waah waah waah. Yes, I know, safe is not fun, but it's SAFE - geddit? I'd love to have a boyfriend that I could lick, slurp, suck, and fuck (and I do squirt - but I won't with you) to my heart's content. But I do not have a boyfriend and I'm tired of waiting for him. So, rather than continue to lose my mind (it's been over a year) I'm seriously contemplating seeking the company of someone from CE with whom I can blow off some steam. I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. So can we please keep our bodily fluids to ourselves?

Well, that concludes my lecture on marketing your goods to a new, untapped, market. Take heed or don't. But I think you'll see an influx of new responses if you do.

I do want to close by saying: I want to answer an ad. I want to feel one of those pretty penises inside me (with condom, of course), pounding me until I cum my brains out (some raunch for you!), making me scream so loudly that I'm hoarse at work the next day. And afterwards, I don't want to see you again. I truly believe I could this, but I need a good ad.

Feel free to write one. ;)

Hi
I am usually attracted to a man (45+, any race) who is warm, charming, educated, well traveled, enjoys the finer things in life but also enjoys a quiet relaxed atmosphere and most of all single/unattached.

A little about myself. I am black, educated, spiritual, a little reserved, sensual, sophisticated, positive, I avoid drama and possessive men etc. I enjoy a variety of things such as the arts, cooking, fine dining, reading, world news, traveling, warm weather, beaches etc. 

The relationship l envision would be one that is stress free, giving each other space at a comfortable level, good communication and cultivating the relationship with no stress/drama but with warmth and respect for each other.

Please send only fully clothed photos.

Thanks

I want a husband who feels the same way. One that has the same sexual appetite as i do and desires to be as intimate as i do. But this all has to be in context of an exclusive relationship. So I will protect the sanctity of my future marriage. I will love, honor and respect him. 

I would prefer a man that is older than I am with the wisdom, maturity and stability to ensure we have a great chance at a new life.

I am growing in my spiritual faith every day and am seeking someone I can grow in faith with. 
I am a SWF 55 years young at heart, a career professional.
I am very attractive and sexy with a sweet, tender heart and a kind soul.
I am an empty nester. That is drug and smoke free, seeking the same.
I am a home chef, hoping to find a partner who desires to express his culinary skills.
I am a nature enthusiast and enjoy trips to historic coastal towns, seeking a companion to explore new destinations with.
I am health conscious, learning about organic products and yoga, looking for a companion who desires a healthy mind, body and soul. 

I am looking for a companion close to my age, attractive, clean cut, well groomed, that lives close to DC MD VA. 
I am not interested in a long distance relationship. 

Just like the five C's of a precious gem stone. 
The five C's of a man's facets that are important to me are: Compassion, Confidence, Charm, Charisma and most of all a Curious mind. 

When responding, include a current photo and tell me where you live so 
I know you are not a SCAMMER.
If you sound interesting, I will return the favor in kind 
with a current photo and my cell number so you can call me. 
I am not doing endless emails that lead nowhere.

May you be blessed in your search. . .

It's spring and I want to spend time with a fun loving, affectionate, outdoorsy companion. I go out a lot with friends, but I miss having someone around during the downtime, the quiet moments at and near home that would be so much more pleasant with a partner. Specifically, I like working in my yard- weeding, landscaping and gardening. I've also promised myself to do a porch makeover this spring, but I don't like being alone, so having someone to help (or just keep me company) would be great. I walk my dog in Rock Creek Park most days, care to join me? Finally, I like flat water kayaking on the waterways around DC- my favorite spot is Bladensburg boat house, where you kayak between the Arboretum and the Aquatic Gardens. Sound fun to you? 

So here's the catch- I feel like I've been dating since the dawn of man, and very rarely do I find men who spark my interest (probably my own issue, but I am who I am). I've been in love twice, and hope to find at least one more, where the feeling builds and lasts over time (the most elusive part). And YES, I want to get married someday and live happily ever after with one man. I've had a very exciting life and still do, and I am looking for someone who also has their own fulfilling life, but wants a partner. I have stories to tell, and I want to hear your stories. I want to have interesting, engaging conversation about world issues, the environment, and what you had for dinner last night. The art of conversation is dying, and I am holding on for dear life. Let's TALK. Not text, not IM. 

Please be a native English speaker (or native level), have at least a bachelors degree, and enjoy your job. Why do folks get upset when someone asks what you do? Isn't that how most of us spend the majority of our waking hours? Good or bad, your work probably says a lot about you. 

I'm an extrovert and get along best romantically with other extroverts. I am Jewish and liberal, a winning combination in my book ;-) I'm flexible on religion, not on politics. I'm 41 and presumably you are close (ish) to me in age, and preferably in geography- I live in NW. 

Finally, I used to think this would go without saying, but since I've been proven wrong time and again... Yes, I enjoy sex. I am a human woman, not a slut, not a sex fiend. Women enjoy sex. I expect a partner who knows how to please me or is open to learning, and believes it is a mandatory part of a physical relationship. If you don't give as well as receive, keep moving. 

See physical details- if you are looking for a quiet little barbie, I'm not the woman for you. If you are looking for a real woman with real curves and real muscles from yoga, running, and spending time outdoors, who eats and laughs out loud and loves herself as she is, come and get me. 

Your thoughtful written response and a clear picture of you will get a reply from me. One sentence replies, phone numbers with request to text, and dick pics will be ignored.

I'm pretty sound in my career and now I'm looking to find someone to travel and enjoy life with. I definitely want to start as friends. I do feel most relationships should be built on friendship.

I hope the men who post ads on CL are not representative of men in general. Surely there are some just plain nice, single guys my age, without daughter or foot fetishes, who aren't just looking to bang anything with a place to put their little fella. 

I'm a fairly simple woman who just wants to have a man in her life. I'm not even interested in cohabitation right now. I'd like to share secrets, hopes and dreams, outings and cozy rainy days in. Midday texts to say hi, little surprises. I'd love to find someone not so married to his job that he has no time for the more important things in life. It's gonna be too late one day!

There are only two things that I'm funny about (truth in advertising): that you're taller than I am (5'7"") and that you spell and punctuate easily. I know! It's weird. We're not going to have English class in bed. But it's a quirk of mine, and I can't help it.

Hi
I am usually attracted to a man (45+, any race) who is warm, charming, educated, well traveled, enjoys the finer things in life but also enjoys a quiet relaxed atmosphere and most of all single/unattached.

A little about myself. I am black, educated, spiritual, a little reserved, sensual, sophisticated, positive, I avoid drama and possessive men etc. I enjoy a variety of things such as the arts, cooking, fine dining, reading, world news, traveling, warm weather, beaches etc. 

The relationship l envision would be one that is stress free, giving each other space at a comfortable level, good communication and cultivating the relationship with no stress/drama but with warmth and respect for each other.

Please send only fully clothed photos.

Thanks

Democrat Blonde Seeks Republican for Bipartisan Fun, Your Platform or Mine

Why canvas door to door when you can just reach across the aisle? If our priorities align, and you can campaign hard and are firm in your resolve, perhaps I will yield you some of my minutes on the floor and permit you to explore my loopholes. Am not seeking donations or expecting you to sign any vows of support---honest, open dialogue, and a genuine interest in my infrastructure are enough to win my vote. As long as we do not experience a huge income gap and respect one another's environments, we should be able to build a sustainable coalition. Let's make America great again!

Fun loving, independent, happy-go-lucky, warm, witty, and wise. Refined, but not snobby. Seeking high quality male companionship to unwind with. Enjoy road trips, obscure museum pilgrimages, sharing home cooked meals and raucous conversation, performing arts, long walks and bike rides, camping, and life's little pleasures. Looking for a one night stand? Then move on, Buster! Please don't misunderstand my opening paragraphs, that's just my sense of humor.

Seeking a gentleman with a mature perspective and an open mind and heart who can hold up his end of a conversation, or enjoy silence when the moment calls for it. I've lived, and continue to live, an interesting life, have traveled the world, etc. so I don't need a man for excitement, or to save me from boredom. What I'm looking for is someone to enjoy the simple things with on weekends and vacations, some attachment without smothering. I am focused on my career and am pretty busy. No time for lengthy email correspondence, so be willing to move to phone quickly and meet soon.

No drugs, non-smoker, very light drinker, stable, US citizen. Would prefer someone with similar qualities and a positive attitude. Please be age-appropriate, not married, and live reasonably close by. FYI, I am fat (in all the right places). I mention it not because I am proud of it, but to be honest and efficient.

Hello, my name is Shanika. I am 36 years old. Single, dark brown-skinned attractive woman living in Springfield, Virginia. What I love most about where I am on my life right now is being able to enjoy watching my nieces and nephews grow up. They are My LoveJoys. Cooking is one of my favorite things to do; especially learning how to prepare different cultural cuisines. Dancing is a must at any given time for me. I can't compromise on that. So a man that knows how to dance is a plus. Any day that is easy going, relaxing, and ending with a great movie is a perfect evening. Perhaps, someday I will be able to have to share a perfect evening with a single, attractive, like-minded man. I hope to hear from you.

With some hope and a bit of faith, I will find you. Who cares if it's online or in person; no one has to know how we came to be. He's a hopeless romantic; sensitive and caring. He isn't afraid to stick up for himself and the one he loves. He can keep an intelligent conversation going and isn't afraid of depth, either intellectually or emotionally; he wants to his girl heart, body and soul. Ideally, he's creative and headstrong; he knows what he wants and he races the sun to obtain it. He doesn't make excuses or promises that he can't keep; he says what he means and does what he says. 
He's a man of character, strength and enjoys a good time. He can be quiet or loquacious; he can be moody or jealous so long as he understands that he can always communicate his feelings without being rebuked for how he feels. He has a wicked sense of humor and doesn't mind being a complete goofball. With some luck, he's looking for a girl who is down to earth, laid back and willing to take things slow without dragging their feet. 
This is not a fairy tale and I'm not trying to weave an ideal fellow from a pile of straw. I understand that no one is perfect and we're all just looking for someone who makes us happy and complete; even if we're only looking for a hook-up at this moment. I hope he's out there, sees this and replies; he'll know what to say. Please be in the DC area and between 35 and 55

Considerably attractive, naturally feminine lady. In my leisure, I would love to have someone refreshing to do things with- concerts, movies, walks, museums, road trips...and so on
Please have: a good head on your shoulders, a good heart and soul, responsible, unattached, dependable and a committed friend. Seeking honesty. .. good communication too, someone healthy, clean, thin - average figure- tall, fit, attractive to be around.

Seeking a mature, secure friend (preferably mid 30s ---early 40s.) Enrich my life. I have just a little time on my hands to get to know someone of quality. I seek to hang out, and this to be a one on one experience.... something to safely always look forward to.

Very 420 friendly for now

If interested, respond with your phone number, and ideal time to contact. I will not text or email you. Your picture is optional, but appreciated...don't ask for mine outright.

I am so sick of posting on all these online dating sites, only to get tons of guys who say they want to meet me (or send me winks/likes etc) but never actually email me. And then there are those who actually do email me but can't seem to take the next step and call me. But, let's not forget those guys who are ok talking on the phone or texting - but can't seem to actually ask me out! I don't understand what all that is about. 

The only reasonable explanation I can think of is because they are in another relationship (or courting someone for a new relationship) and not willing to be honest abut that, but too scared to give up another possibility. Does that ring true? 

And if so, how horrible that is. 

If you feel the same way that I do, and (big if here) IF you have Friday night free - lets talk about actually meeting in person for a date. 

I know it is scary for you guys. Because I might kidnap you at gunpoint and do horrible things to you!

But, I promise I won't. And I promise we will meet in a very public place because I too worry about those things happening to me. 

But - let's get to the important aspects - to see whether I am someone you might want to actually meet on Friday night - and vice versa. 

I am an educated, affectionate, young at heart, funny (hopefully that has come across in this posting just a bit?), down to earth, honest, and dependable SWF. I am also attractive (for my age), witty and can talk about almost anything - assuming I am paired with someone who also likes to talk. 

Also - I am a non-smoker, non drug user, social drinker and have no kids living at home. Looking for the same. 

I am not concerned about race - so black, white, pink or green - you are all welcome to reply, but if you are either of the later two - I'll require a picture to verify. 

I love most sports (won my bracket pool!!), the great outdoors, cooking, weekend getaways and live music and live theater. What about you?

Men I connect with are smart, easy to talk to, good sense of humor, and flirty. Extra points if you are taller than I, in good enough shape that you can see your toes when you look down, and have a great smile that you use often. Please be reasonably (plus or minus 10 years) close to my age and live in the DC area. 

Those who provide a lengthy reply providing as much information about yourself (at the bare minimum - age, race, height, body, location, interests, etc) will not be ignored. Those who send a canned reply that could be sent to any woman's post, will be ignored. 

To show me you read this entire ad, in your subject line, put where you want to meet on Friday, and the time. Ciao!

Do guys want real or good women anymore? Or just ""bad bitches""? I understand the preference, but when you grow up and are looking for traits in a woman like loyalty, responsibility, caring, and not needing your money cuz I got my own, hit me up. When you want more from someone than just looking good in front of your boys, like carrying an intelligent conversation and someone to give you strength and support, hit me up. I love sex, too. Who doesn't? But if you're ready for mental stimulation mixed in with some physical, you guessed it, hit me up.

In my late 40s I finally found the courage to leave my job as a graphic designer and pursue my passion for food. It was part of a long maturing process that also involved creating a healthy distance between myself and my emotionally crippled family. My interest in nutrition soon led to an excitement about cooking and eventually to my becoming a health-oriented personal chef. My individuation from my family and their white-bread-and-mayonnaise values has led to the discovery of myself as a person who is willing to feel deeply, act boldly and think creatively. I want to be with a man who has also become his own person, who considers life an adventure and who has time for romance, intimacy and me.

In my work I help others cook better, host cooking/dinner parties, and cater dinner parties. I'm interested in exploring the science as well as practicing the art of cooking. It would be be great to be with someone who enjoys food and who likes to be the kitchen but I'm capable of being drawn into your world as well if you truly love what you do.

A good match for me is someone who . . ..

...wants to make a difference (big or small scale).
. . .is happy to take the scenic route to just about anywhere
. . .is charmed by down-in-the valley views just as much as bird's-eye vistas.
. . .wants to explore the world --cultures and history-- through food and people, cities and the countryside
....likes to be active, has all-day energy.


Religion has no appeal to me - but I'm definitely intrigued with ""spirituality"" (am using this for a lack of a better word). Meaning to say, I'm interested in understanding that what's there but cannot be seen.

Community involvement is important to me, I'm active with the South Bay sustainable food movement. Will soon start a two-year term as president of a nonprofit.

Friends? Family? Kids? I have several very close friends, and consider them my family. I raised 4 step children with ex husband in the 90s/early 00s.

Still have my full-suspension mtn bike, panniers, snorkel, backpack, sleeping bag, downhill ski equipment, X-country ski boots, snowshoes. ...and want to do all these activities with a partner,

Eventually, I want to golf, have really enjoyed it the couple of times I've played. And I want to play the piano again, and ride a horse again. I would love to be a good singer and hope to someday take lessons, bonus if I find someone who likes to sing (together). And I love to dance ... the waltz, tango, swing. I'm not one who needs perfection, just enjoyment in a shared activity.

Love yoga, hiking, once or twice a week. I run, occasionally. I like to bike and hope you are ok with me --a slow poke-- some distance behind you. I actually like to fish (shore or boat --jigging, casting, slabbing), I don't have the gear or make a point of going, but will definitely join my partner.

I thoroughly enjoy concerts and live theater; not much of a fan of opera or spectator sports.

I'm exploring and expanding my emotional range with those who are close to me.. It feels like the key to getting the most out of life. !!! I'm not looking for a hook up or sex sorry not sorry not my deal but hey if that's for you good luck truly. I love to spend time with my family and friends I'm not rich at all i I live in a quaint little apartment that is purrrrfect for me. I love cooking and baking star gazing and photography being a positive person as often as I can but sometimes even I faulter anyways id love to meet someone like me and also unlike me I want to meet someone who balances me out and with whom I can balance out but we should both be intelligent and kind patient and sincere loyal and non judgemental open minded and hopefully seeking the same things marriage family love life and happiness. I am a Christian don't drink or smoke no illegal drugs so that's a no go ha Anyways tell me about yourself send me a photo or two tell me what you're looking for I've done a pretty great job explaining myself also I like sports and the outdoors and travel and reading movies and music decorating and crafting sooo you'd already know we'd have cutest little house on the block I have great taste anyways take a chance on me I ain't so bad but I will say this I've learned about myself and if you can't except it I understand I don't have the best self esteem but I'm working on it I'm trying to see hiw far I've cone since 2 years ago not without pain and suffering and trials but I'm getting through them be my partner in crime will you be my clyde and ill be your bonnie

P.s. If you can't tell from my photos I'm a huge goof lifes too short to be serious all the time smile darling everyday can be a part of our story and adventure you just have to meet me halfway

Oh and if you're just looking for post to bash because you're bored and miserable I'm sorry your life is so sad... Reach out to a friend find someone to connect with we all need people!! I'm not perfect I'm not the smartest or most beautiful or most anything girl in the world but I strive every day to be better than today...

Hey Everyone, if your on here and reading this you either 1. Live a busy life style, and don't have time to go out and meet women 2. Not confident in talking to women 3. Just looking to fuck.

That is what I have found from getting responses from men. However, when I get replies I usually read all of them. I get a lot and don't always have the chance to reply to all of them. If I don't reply right away I will in time, but it could be to tell you I'm just not interested which is normal and human thing for me to do, it's nothing personal.

I would like to meet a man who loves with his whole heart, sees the beauty in the small things, someone who can expand my heart and mind on many levels and different perspectives and I will do the same for him. 

I tend to be pretty busy so as of right now I would like to start as friends with the intention of it becoming more serious, but please no first date hook ups. So if interested include a brief bio with your age, profession, interest, intentions, location and something rare about you to break the ice.An attached recent photo puts you at the top of the list.

Some of you are probably wondering why I am posting here. I post here because I'm not quite 21 and I tend to like older men so going to a bar isn't a option as of now and in other settings even tho I am confident it is more intimidating lol
Which lands me here.

Hello everyone! Thanks for clicking on my post, that means my well thought out key words worked in your search and we are one step closer to finding out if we are a match. That's an exciting thought =)

I'm looking for an available guy, completely single and emotionally ready to pursue a relationship. I hope you are: funny, caring, kind, educated, professional, passionate, ambitious, sexy and adventurous. I am open to different races and not picky on one's height. Please be between the ages of 35-48, and yes my age falls within that range. No drugs, not 420 friendly. Also not looking for any FOBs--I've tried dating guys from other countries and sometimes the cultural differences are too much to overcome.

As for me I am single, white, big (fat, roly poly, bbw, whatever you want to call it--I'm not hiding what I am), kind of on the short side (at least in my family), I have an amazing laugh and smile, sexy voice, love to have a good time, enjoy learning about new people/culture/geography, have multiple degrees, am cultured, like hiking and going on walks, and a pretty good cook. 

I also, and I know this is important to you all, enjoy sex. I am a very sexual person with a high sex drive. I expect the same from you and we can discuss what this means to the both us as we get to know each other better.

I'm looking for someone who wants to get to know me better over a home cooked meal, a day trip to a Virginia winery, a weekend getaway (yes with hot sex on the menu), someone who isn't looking to jump from bed to bed but is ready to find the person they can see themselves with for the long run. Perhaps that is me? =)

A note to the men over 48, please don't respond because the first thing I'm going to ask you is how old are you.

A note to the married/in a relationship/don't think I'm in a relationship but she thinks we are guys, please don't respond because I'm going to ask you if you are truly single.

A note to the divorced/single dads--I welcome you to respond but only if you are truly capable of balancing a new relationship with your responsibilities as a single dad. A text once or twice a week won't suffice for me.

Ok...I've practically written an novel and most of you just scanned until you saw the sex talk, so now it is up to you--I hope you take a chance on me. =)

Must be over 50 years of age. No one out of this area will be considered. I'm a good woman who will treat her man like a king. He in turn must treat me like a queen. I know you're out there guys.

The fact is some dudes have to do better.

The number 1 thing I hear guys say is, women only like bad boys. Followed by, ""what does she look like?"" So in one breathe you have someone calling a woman pretty much superficial because she looks for a certain attribute in a man and in another breathe you have that's same someone reducing a woman to a particular attribute. 
Newsflash, both sexes have good people and bad people. Both sexes can be superficial. But there are a lot of self proclaimed ""nice"" or ""good"" guys that actually aren't. Just because a woman doesn't want you doesn't mean its because she thinks you're a nice guy, you could simply suck. And no one wants to be with a sucky person. 
If you only want a woman for her looks you are not a nice guy. If you treat women badly because of the way women have treated you, you are not a good guy. And if you do something nice expecting something in return or some kind or recognition, you are selfish. Luckily that's not all men.

I am a 60 yo SWF that is a BBW (size 14/16) with short red hair. Married when I was young, separated at a young age, raised one daughter. I have not had problems dating. However, looking for the LOVE of my life (may not find it on CL).

Here are my preferences:
Please do not smoke, drink or do drugs, 45-55 yo. Please be single and unattached. CL is one medium of many to try to find someone, and although I am not prejudiced, expect that I may not respond, so do not be offended. This is one of many avenues to try to meet people.

Send your pic and description: height/weight/age/location and race as well.

Or if you do not fit my preferred profile/description, tell me why we should meet. LOL
Write something interesting in your response but should only have the salient information requested. Simply a few sentences, not a whole page. Everybody does not have time to read a long response (or a long ad for that matter, sorry this is so long).

I am not single but I am looking for a long term companion to keep me company and meet on occasion. 

Interested? Curious? If you are and you are between 30-45ish, professional, are mostly grammatically correct, disease and drug free, and don't have a very specific type in mind...say hello.

Art and craft I do;someone who can have a comfortable discussion about such things. Someone who thinks that morals and values and decency are important.I live my life through the word of God and through my spirituality....My reasoning which I understand is very strange in today's world,but my believe is my heart and soul,and the passions that is in it is very unique and special,so I made the decision and made a promise to God that I would not be sexually active for the sake of just wanting sex or to have sex for someone else own self gratification.
Knowing the passion that is contained in my heart and soul is very unique,I made the decision to abstain from sex because I want this special gift to be shared with the person I am dedicating the rest of my life too,as his Wife and the future of his needs to provide sometimes.I'm real this isn't a gimmick please use your email as subject line so I know your real too.

Hello D/M/V--
I recently posted here and posting again to clear some things up. For starters, I am an attractive, full-figured/plus-size black woman--that means I do have meat on my bones and NOT thin. This posting is for the man who understands this and has NO issue or hang ups with it If you are no hard feelings, best of luck. For everyone else keep reading. :) 

Ok, I'm a SBF who happens to be in DC/MD/VA area for the next few months and I'm very interested in meeting and connecting with someone while I'm here. I consider myself to be an outgoing, down-to-earth woman with an infectious personality. I have a wonderful sense of humor and love to laugh. So, if you can make me laugh, then we're already off to a good start! I also enjoy engaging conversations; therefore if your conversation skills are little to none, chances are I won't be the least bit interested. 

I am seeking a SBM who is well educated, with little baggage and no more than ONE child. Ideally, he is someone who is a traditionalist in that he still hold doors open for ladies and walk them to their cars, but a modernist in that he's open to finding something out on the town that's creative, interesting, and fun to do. Although sometimes I do enjoy just sitting on the couch watching TV. Oh, and while I don't mind emailing and texting, I'd like someone who prefers hearing my voice.

Lastly, I strongly believe in taking advantage of everything life has to offer. I'll learn what you love, and tell you what I love; then let's have fun getting to know each other and taking life in! If any of this interests you, then please email me!

Obviously, I prefer to get to the point and not sugar coat it with cutesy acronyms. If you are a gooey centered, white alpha male who doesn't care that your chick is fat, read on. 

If not, you are wasting both of our time. 

Attached is a picture, because men are visual and what not. In your reply, I would appreciate some effort. I am going to get 100 repsonses from this post. 75 will be random dick pics, which will be ignored, unless its a human oddity. The oddity will intrigue me for about 3 minutes, but not enough to get me to meet it in person. 22 will be ""Hey wats up, still lookin"" and the other 3 will be great potential matches, that I could potentially make lots of fun, yet bad decisions with. Be one of the 3, not the 97 that I ignore. 

This morning I found myself wishing I had a semi regular brunch partner. Someone who I could wake up with, throw my leg over and tempt with brunch by talking about the bruleed grapefruit at Farmer Fisher Baker's. Ok, so I know a grapefruit probably wouldn't tempt any dude, but come on, it has fire scorched sugar on top, its heaven. Yes, they have some pretty good man food too. 

Sigh. Anyway. 

I am a nurse, I see more bad things than any one person should. For that reason, I don't nitpick or nag. Things that are just simply annoying, aren't worth the effort. I am reasonably sane. I can cook well, and I will likely make you a sandwich without being asked. I am a spoiler, probably even more when you don't deserve it. 

I find intelligence sexy, but have been known to have some real airheaded moments. 

I am an INFJ, if you are into that whole Myers Briggs thing. Its a pretty accurate portrayal of me too. I am not crippled by my introversion, but I definitely do not mind spending a Friday night at home, catching up on the one or two TV shows I watch each week. It is getting closer to summer though, and what in the hell am I going to do while Scandal isnt airing? Probably sit on the roof of my building, have a drink and admire the skyline. Join me?

Hi Guys, 

*your pic gets mine*

I'm the kind of girl that you would want to take home to mom, take around your friends, take to your corporate parties and take out for romantic one-on-ones. Sounds clichĂŠ right? My friends would describe me as a person that always has the best intentions in everything I do, more intuitive than logical, patient, reliable, persistent and determined. I do value harmony in my personal life and do what I can to keep my mate/friends happy. 

I'm a single, attractive, thick, fun, adventurous, professional AA, (almost) 31 yo woman open to meeting a good, honest and professional male. Whether be for friendship, chat or to developing something more.. open to what that entails

Now to the part of where I let you know what I'm seeking. I am looking for a guy that is attractive, tall (tall as in taller than my height), keep up with his appearance and carries him self very well, has his life in order or getting it in order ( by having no drama what's to ever), low key and knows what he wants out of life, goal oriented, down to earth, loyal, caring, open minded, adventurous and honest. Blah Blah Blah... I will say I am USUALLY attracted to white males..

Must be open to being friends first, more if there's a connection. If friendship is all you want, I'm cool with that too. Guys who are married, players, under 5'8"" would not be the right guy for me. On the other hand, if you are good man who is age, height and weight appropriate and knows what it means to have a good/chill woman by your side, you are my Mr. Right/Right Now!! 

Please be respectful. You pic gets mine. Hopefully, we can be that special someone for each other!

Hi Guys,

I'm the kind of girl that you would want to take home to mom, take around your friends, take to your corporate parties and take out for romantic one-on-ones. 

I'm a single, attractive, super fit, fun, adventurous, professional AA, 34 yo woman open to meeting a good, honest, fit and professional male. 

Must be open to being friends first (No FWBs!), more if there's a connection. Guys who are married, players, seperated, looking for a sexual encounter, under 5'10 or over the age of 45 would not be the right guy for me. On the other hand, if you are good man who is age, height and weight appropriate and knows what it means to have a good woman by your side, you are my Mr. Right and Right Now!!

Please take a little time to tell me a bit about yourself and respond with your pic. I will only reply to thoughtful, serious responses. Please be respectful. Hopefully, we can be that special someone for eachother!

Hello!

While I realize a list of attributes doesn't give off an open-minded type of person, I also know from past experiences people I am more likely to bond with. So while I'm not bound fast to these ideals, here are some things I strongly prefer: college education, non-smoker, social drinker, not previously divorced, no children but wants them one day, somewhere in your 30s, not allergic to pets, has a car, no criminal history (okay, maybe a speeding ticket!) honest, and affectionate. Oh, and blue eyes are helpful :-)

A bit about me- graduate degree, teacher, non-smoker, enjoy traveling, honest to a fault, love pets, lived abroad.

I have pictures to share and expect the same. Tell me about yourself in your response. I won't reply unless you've at least put a little effort in!

Goodess, is what you address me by. 

You?

You're submissive, You seek domination, You enjoy serving your Goddess, You will complete my chores, I will own you, You will be locked until I say you can release unless you find a way to convince me not to, You are my house boy, You love massaging my feet, and most of all: You adore the ground I walk on and know your place as my servant. 

To gain my attention, you will need to prove you're real I will be the poison that you become most addicted to. 

You will NOT waste my time. You will NOT write me if you are not ready to obey. You will ABSOLUTELY NOT write me if you are a slave whom is confused and will disappear. My time IS precious, realize that you are lucky if I choose to communicate with you. 

Me? 

I am young, I am vibrant, I am alluring, I am going to Law school, I am ambitious, I am fun, I am your owner, I take control, and I reward you when you take care of your Goddess.

I am willing to help other subs and/or answer any questions that you may have.

But...

You are a white older male.

Your Goddess awaits.

Okay, maybe you're not really interested in finding a decent Jewish girl. Maybe you're content to continue to hop from bar to bar in pursuit of Mrs. Right. Or even worse, maybe you don't mind trawling the waters of the internet attracting whatever dating barnacles attach themselves to your wonderfulness. 

Well that's fine. But you should answer this ad anyway. 

So the Holidays are upon us soon. And if you are not sure what holidays I'm referring to you should just stop reading now. Perhaps you don't mind having those moments at your family get togethers where Granny walks past you, and with a heaving sigh and wonders aloud to herself, (loud enough so that you could hear) if she would ever live to see you get married? Your mother reminds you that you arenÂ´t getting any younger, and why canÂ´t you be more like your brother\sister\cousin (thrice-removed) and settle down? Well, there is no need to suffer in silence when you can lay the groundwork for a triumphant response the next time this happens. As the nice Jewish guy that you are (but obviously with a superlative amount of naughty to boot) you can't but help to want to write to me, and send me a pic, and extol the virtues that would lure me into your embrace and keep me there so that the next time Granny sighs it can be of happiness?

I love watching sports, going to the beach, trying new restaurants, mini road trips, TV shows (both the really bad and the really good) and, my favorite, lazy afternoons spent cuddling with someone that you can't stop thinking about :) I live a pretty stable life...I have a great apartment and work at a job that I like that lets me keep pretty normal business hours and prefer to find someone with ambition but who still has time for a relationship (there are a lot of workaholics in this city).

I guess if any of this sounds interesting and you think we'd get along, shoot me an email (longer than a line or two, please!) I'm hoping to find someone between 27-38 and taller than 6'0 (only because I'm tall as well). I hope to hear from you soon!

Im more interested in that guy that doesnt have any plans. No one to party and drink with. You probably don't even drink at all. Your weekends are more than likely spent watching reruns of your favorite tv program or engaged in some other personal fulfilling task that you enjoy.

Maybe thats what I need, a different type of romance someone completely the polar opposite of what i had

Been searching for you for a long time,you are kind,REALLY kind not just because YOU say so but because others see it and hear it in your words and actions and because of that you are blessed with good friends and relationships. You have a good heart and a little on the old fashioned side when it comes to women ,which is a good thing. You harbor no grudges ,nor have no true enemies.You let go of the bad and hang on tightly to the good because theres far to much of a shortage of it in this wacky world.You have an attitude of gratefulness and positiveness tempered with a strong faith in God.You love animals especially dogs they are a true gift to us. You are mature and in good shape you pride yourself on your appearance yet you are not vain, almost self deprecating.You have a great sense of humor because that ,with God, gets us through the everyday hills and valleys/You love or loved your Mom ,trust me that's important. 
You want to work yes WORK at having that last long ""death till us do part"" relationship.Knowing neither are far from perfect and we have some dings and dents both physically and emotionally but inside deep inside your heart is as fresh and unfettered as a childs laughter.
You are inquisitive you can talk about anything and you can LISTEN really listen when need be.You still have dreams BIG dreams of traveling the earth or maybe just up the block with your love hand in hand heart to heart hip to hip forever and ever Amen !

Hi, 

I am a 32 year old woman looking to meet a kind, tall gentleman. Specifically super well endowed. I mean I would like him to be so well endowed that he has had problems with keeping a girlfriend because women aren't able to handle him.

I'm attractive, have pictures to exchange and looking to get to know you to see if there is chemistry. He can be African, African American or Caucasian.

Adrenaline
Challenge 
Excitement 
Spontaneity 
Patience

Those are all characteristics that most men cannot handle but desire. So tell me, which man are you? Are you the boring man that is hoping to be noticed from across the room? Or... Are you the man that indulges in the necessities of life? 

You should be well put together, curious, well-mannered, economically stable, exquisite, and enjoy the taste of wine or scotch. 

I like to think of myself as a young college educated ambitious woman who enjoys the conversation and company of an older male. Sometimes we get so caught up in life that we need a moment to actually enjoy it. Alluring is what best describes me because your mind will always be wandering. 

What could I be looking for? Well... An older man to talk to, explore with, and certainly mentor me. I enjoy wonderful restaurants (Georgetown has some of my favorites), shows at the Kennedy Center, traveling, and exploring the art of culture. Those are just some of my many interests. 

Could that be you?

To gain my full attention, you will need to prove you're real. I will be the poison that you become most addicted to. 

You will NOT waste my time. You will NOT write me if you are not ready to obey. You will ABSOLUTELY NOT write me if you are a slave whom is confused and will disappear. My time IS precious, realize that you are lucky if I choose to communicate with you. 

Me?

Hey everybody

I am a 26 year old looking to make a connection with someone. I'm going to just put some basic things on here and then feel free to ask anything else :)

I am working on a Masters, my BA is from GMU 

I have a curvy body type, however I am health conscious and regularly go to the gym

I'm a single mom to a three year old boy, I take care of him a hundred percent with the help of my family, however the dad isn't in the picture at all

I like the outdoors; love to hike and go for bike rides. Having BBQ's by the pool is fun in the summer 

I work hard, some weekends I do like to relax and drink with friends

My last relationship was seven years and I learned a lot about what's important. I believe in commitment and trust but I know it takes time to build those things. In general, I am a very laid back, positive person that doesn't spend much time dwelling on the negative. I tend to be more spontaneous and wants someone that is like minded in that way. 

I'm Italian 

Love to cook!!

Oh, and debt free, std free, always a plus :P

It's not a good sign that I am already trying to find a way to procrastinate on a Monday - a busy Monday at that! But it doesn't hurt to try and find someone cool to chat with, does it?

I am not looking for anything sexual so all you Craigslist perverts - move on to the next posting. I want to see if there are any normal, single, fun guys still left in this area. I seem to keep finding all the married ones and that's not what I am into.

I am happy to tell you more about me and share photos once you send me an email with your photo and age and some info about you. 

Hope you are having a good day! 35 - 48 please.

People always ask me why I'm so shy. But the thing is, I'm not. Behind the shy exterior is a very curious girl. I guess I just want someone to teach me about the world.....politics, love making, love itself, the world. All the above. If you're an attractive older gentleman and think that may be you, you know where to find me ;)

Maybe you need a ride, a drink, a listening ear, hit me up lets talk. I had a brother get out of prison years ago and he committed suicide because no one helped him, I was just a teenager 

Obviously I won't engage in anything illegal but I am looking to help where I can if you are trying to get on track or you just need someone to throw back a beer and talk with, without judgment

I am 29 so would make sense if we are around the same age...

I like working out so I could use a workout buddy, I got a buddy pass at a gym

Hi There! 

I am a 41 year old woman that is attracted to much older, slightly overweight men but has never dated one. I am interested in meeting an older man for a drink and if things go well, maybe it could turn into a casual encounter or FWB type of thing. I am on the submissive side so I prefer someone that is dominant and not afraid to take the lead if things progress beyond just a drink. You can be kinky but you must be respectful.

Simply looking for a friend first who would potentially be open for something serious If chemistry is there. I'm on the heavy side, light brown hair, fair skin, in my 40's. 
My aunt met her fiancé on here, so anything is possible . I figured I would give it a try. My type of men are white and not in a relationship, or married. I do have an education and kids from my previous marriage.
