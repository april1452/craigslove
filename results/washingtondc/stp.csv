Good mornin on this rainy ugly Monday. So were on craigslist browsing I see if your reason my ad. I wanted to talk and find someone that I can maybe have conversation and a little discrete friendship with.

So me, I'm married and been married a long time.. I love my life and everything about it, but sometimes after being with someone so long you feel like your missing out or just longing for attention. I have no desire to change either of our marital statuses. All I want is to find someone similar to myself and that being, normal everyday person dedicated to their family and no one in the world would suspect us to be on CL, you would need to be married and have a family and enough to lose that discretion is extremely important. You need to desire attention, and that warm feeling again when someone makes you feel hAppy.. This is a no pressure thing meaning let's just start as chat and go from there wherever it takes us.. I am 32 so I prefer a married women between 25- 45. I'm available to have email chats all day so it be nice if you had time during the day as we'll, since evenings aren't gonna work we'll.. So if you read my add and interested shoot me a email as if love I hear from you and see where it goes. Stay dry stay safe and hope to talk soon!!

If you are down with the private investigation please hit me up. I would prefer if you were in the area of DC or pg county and between 19-26 that helps. So I basically just need to see whats hes been doing on social media that I'm blocked from, and I don't want to make a fake page because that's way to obvious. 

My preference is for someone that can let me have access to your page... Which is why I would prefer if you have a fake page.

Ok so no judging, if this isn't the thing for you please keep it moving. Also I don't welcome bashing emails about my approach to the situation. .... my my PI assistant.. thanks in advance!!

I find myself feeling somewhat restless, and looking for sustained connections online. My goal in doing this isn't to engage in a torrid physical affair but rather to find steady electronic interaction (mainly via email) with someone who stimulates me intellectually, emotionally, and physically.

I'm seeking someone in the 32-40 age range. Also, I'd prefer if she was reasonably well educated and engaged in professional careers. (No, I won't be expecting to see a resume, but there will be more common ground with someone in a white collar occupation.) I'm a fit, active person, and I'd prefer someone who is similarly inclined (runner, yogi practitioner, etc.), or at least fits into the ""HWP"" category. There are some other characteristics that I value, but they seem rather generic and subjective: sense of humor, literacy, taste in music, books, wine, etc. 

Finally, I won't try to meet you in person, nor will I inflict unsolicited pictures of my genitalia on you. I'll just be a regular, nice guy.

Bored? Looking for some excitement a few weekends this summer? I'm looking for an open-minded, drug-free travel companion this summer. I have a couple trips to North Carolina, Pennsylvania and maybe even South Carolina coming up soon and would like to not do it alone. These trips are car club related so expect lots of cruising, picture taking and car talk with fellow enthusiasts. Generally, these trips are Thursday thru Sunday but vary. SC may be 9-10 days.

You should be late 20s to late 40s, on the shorter side (think 5'4"" and below), HW proportional (No BBW sorry), attractive but not looking for a model, non smoker would be preferred and willing to play the part of my girlfriend as required in public settings. This would include some kissing and touching to be believable.

This is not an advertisement for sex. I'm not paying you with money but you get the thrill of travel, all your food and drinks covered and I'm fine with buying you clothing to make you look good. Basically, you get a sugar daddy for a weekend without having to have sex with me. 

Me: 42, short, bearded and bald, not a big, fat guy but I need to start running again. I drink, absolutely no drugs, non smoker and white.

Hey Guys! I am a 28 year old gay guy who is looking for a genuine friends. Not really into clubs and bars so making friends in this town can be difficult- would be open to trying a couple out if I had some cool people to go out with. I enjoy gchatting at work, texting, and emailing. Have to speed the day along some how!I love traveling, camping, going to the beach, movies, and cooking. Ideally we would hang out and stuff but can start out with email and texting. 

I am a Maryland native and own my own business. I really like Art- visual and performing. Super cliche I know, but I'm very into Musical Theater. I love being outside- hiking, camping, and exploring historical places. Down for weekend trips- anything from NYC to Williamsburg to Philly. I try to travel as much as possible. I am looking for someone who is honest, down to earth, and not a closet case trying to score a hookup. 

You don't have to be gay! I have many straight buddies. Looking for friends who are interested in hanging out in person as well! I'm smoke and drug free (occasional 420) if that matters. 

Hit me up if you want to get to know me!! Nothing planned this weekend - let's change that :)

Hello, I am a 32 year old guy living in Pentagon City who works in the Crystal City area. I am looking for a work out partner where we can motivate each other to go to the gym.

We could go to classes together, do some basic training together, or show up & go our separate ways. I am not a member of any gym yet but I am considering LA Fitness, Sport & Health, & possibly Golds Gym. I work 9-5ish & am able to go either before work or after & if Sport & Health is the choice, I'd consider going at lunch too. 

I am open to a man, woman or group of people if I get multiple responses. Please note this is strictly platonic.

It's almost 9pm on a Saturday night and there's nothing to do. Most of the other twenty-somethings and thirty-somethings are going out to the bars and clubs. You could go too; perhaps your friends have invited you to go out with them; but it's really not your thing. What you wish most of all was that the library was open. A really nice library, with cozy chairs, hardwood floors, area rugs, and real wooden bookshelves. But at this time of night, all of the libraries are closed and locked. Apparently nobody likes to read a Saturday night.

Still, you like to fantasize. You like to imagine yourself walking through the aisles, pausing ever so briefly each time one of your familiar favorites catches your eye: Austen, Bronte, Dickens, Dickinson, Faulkner, Hemingway, Hugo, Joyce. . . Just seeing the names brings a smile to your face as you recall the pleasures that their words have given you over the years. You've already read almost everything by the great ones, but there is always something more. Another treat to savor. Those last few Shakespeare plays you've never read. Or one of Vladimir Nabokov's more obscure novels from his Russian period. Or Finnegans Wake. No, not Finnegans Wake. You need something that will satisfy tonight, not next year. How about an Emily Dickinson poem? Yes.

You pull a book off the shelf, open to a random page, and continue slowly walking down the aisle as you read the words

Master--open
your life wide, and
take me in forever,
I will never be tired--
I will never be noisy
when you want to be
still--I will be
your best little
girl--

Suddenly, not looking where you are going, you walk right smack into a man. A tall man in a corduroy blazer and dark rimmed glasses. A man who is probably at least ten years older than you, if not more. A man who is surprisingly fit and attractive in a college professor sort of way. Where did he come from? This is your library. Your dream. Your imagination. You thought you were alone. Embarrassed and flustered, you apologize and quickly turn around to head in the other direction.

""The library is closed. What are you doing here? How did you get in here?"" His voice is deep and smooth. Strong. And as he speaks, he places a firm hand on your shoulder.

""What are you reading?"" he asks as he steps closer and places his other hand on your other shoulder. You wonder what kind of dream this is. You can feel his eyes as they read the words on the page

nobody else will see me, but you--
but that is enough--
I shall not want any more--

His big hands begin to slide down your arms, and you can feel your breath quickening. You notice a simple gold band on his finger, and your eyes fixate on it as he takes the book from you, closes it, and places it on the shelf.

You turn around to face him, and you raise your head until the two of you are looking directly into each other's eyes. An academic man and a young scholar. A common love for literature. A quiet place to share each other's interests.

Perhaps we should continue the discussion in a real library?

The big question is what's your number and at what number does it start being kinda gross if ever?

I asked this particular question because recently my buddy went out on a date with a chick who has been with 14 guys, she confessed that she didn't like to use condoms and my buddy didn't see her again. Answer the questions if you wish and leave any comment you might have on the issue.

I am a 36 years old, 6t tall, 205lb, great shape and muscular. Very down to earth and humble Latin guy. I am looking for someone who is interested in having a workout Partner and a hanging out buddy. I like long bike rides and long walks.I usually workout 4 to 5 times a week and belong to WSC. I am open to workout either in the very early morning or in the evening after 6pm. You can be straight or gay as long as you are very masculine. Be ready and serious about working out. I prefer to work out with someone who is already in shape and know his way around the gym since I am not looking to train anyone. If you are serious please reply back to this posting and tell me about yourself. Please note that I am not a body body builder nor I want to be one. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Hey hey hey! 

Im looking for my new bestie. Someone as fun, outgoing, loyal, and mature as me! Some one I can call and do things like out to eat, bars, go karts, bowling, etc. I dont really club alot. Also Im trying to get my body in shape so maybe we can do things like pole dancing or zumba, and grab a cinnabon after lol. I just want a cool chill friend who needs a bestie as bad as I do and we can create a long lasting bond. 

Now it doesnt matter if you bi or les, im bicurious myself. (So maybe we can be discreet fwb on a drunk night lol) Mainly I just want a friend where we can talk everyday and whos serious. I met people on here before but had no luck. They either was just pic collectors or inconsistent. I dont have no more time to waste. I especially need to find a friend before my 25th birthday when I take a trip to Vegas lol. 

Im really easy to get a long with and have a great personality so hit me up if you feel we connect or even if you dont feel so we can try. I get along with everybody. Even if you just need a friend to vent to im your girl. I love helping people. Im a great friend to have :) I lost my other friends because we grew apart or from their betrayal. But ne who, just reply and tell me a little bout yourself and attach a pic :) 

I give why to much into my friendships and never get the same in return. So if your just looking to email back and or disappear after one day dont bother! 

No doms. No men. No couples. Please be ddd free. Please be between ages 23-28. Looking forward to meeting my new bestie :) 

P.s I know cl is a weird place to make friends but hey Ill try anything once lol ttys fingers crossed :)

Can a male and female be just friends?

Yes and No. If either one of them is single, than game over. 

I can speak from personal experience, specially if the guy is single.

You have probably heard that all guys are monsters, but its not true. Not if he is in a relationship or married etc or has a kid .. yati yati .. you get the picture.

so until he has other things preoccupying his mind, yes maybe they are monsters? but only looking to be tamed by the right female.

I happen to be one of the tamed males, who has or I should say HAD several female friends but as soon as I locked onto one of them and went all the way with the bells and whistles (starting a family etc).. no more female friends are around ..

why?

probably because I dont have any time to spend with them...

So now that Its just me and my family .. I long for other human contact .. because you can only go without outside contact for just so long..

so I am hearing posting on the friend section of CL, I normally post things for $ale etc.

But I want to find a genuine person, who really wants to be a friend.

I am not a monster, I hope you are not either.

Thank you for taking the time to read my ad. I'm a curvy, size 14 jeans, 39 year young female looking for a gentleman that I can hang out with...gay or straight. Race does not matter, however, I do prefer white men. Some possible scenarios are going to the movies, going for walks, to lunch/dinner, the gym, or simply staying home and watching TV or play video games. I'm easy going but tend to get along better with men than women. 

I am truly seeking a platonic relationship...not intimate. I'm simply looking for a cool guy that enjoys the company of an intelligent and attractive African American woman. Why a preferably a single male? Because a single man has more free time...because I have no intention of sneaking around...and most importantly, I do not want to cause any problems for anyone. 

Please respond with your favorite TV show or movie in the subject line. If you send me your picture (do not send me anything inappropriate), I'll send you mine. 

Please, if you are not serious in seeking a platonic friendship, I ask that you do not respond to this ad!

Non-smokers, no drugs. I don't drink, but I don't mind at all if you do. :)

Do you wish there was an older man in the local area with whom you could confide and share your ideas, questions, goals, successes, disappointments, and fantasies? Are you intrigued by the idea of having a completely open-minded father figure who will listen without criticizing or judging? Do you long for someone experienced and assertive with whom you can safely explore your submissive personality in a caring, nurturing way?

I am a local college instructor in my mid forties who would like to pursue with a younger woman a relationship that is more meaningful and less transient than the professional relationships I have with my students. You could be a college student or a college-educated young professional. In order for this to work, you would need to be somewhere in the DC metro area and willing to meet in person. This would be our secret, so I don't mind if you are already in a relationship (as long as you don't mind the same about me). If this sounds interesting, let's meet for a walk or a cup of coffee so we can see whether we have the right chemistry.

Really?!? You clicked on it that quickly. I warned you to open slowly ;) But hello there! Thanks for stopping by and reading...though are you really looking or just here snickering at all the ads? I know...I'd snicker too ;) Or maybe you have an amazing laugh. In any case, I'm a geek in need of a friend. I honestly don't have very many friends and certainly don't have many that I can freely talk to on a regular basis. Now for the tough sell...I'm an older geek, 37 years old, married with a kid; I play video games, love sci-fi movies/tv shows...movies in general are awesome...I even like rom-coms...hey, bearded men do cry ;) I love to read and will try just about anything especially if it's recommended. I like to say I enjoy writing but I honestly don't write much but if I do, it's on the horror side. I'm not religious by any stretch of the imagination...though my imagination runs pretty wild and deep...so ghost stories, hauntings, mediums, life after death and other topics along those lines fascinate me. 

Am I unhappy...no. Am I lonely...yes; though sometimes it's self-inflicted. I'm quiet and shy; a bit hard to read; always thinking; a tad stubborn. I'd love to have a friend with similar interests. Age really isn't a concern and neither is marital status...but if you're married with or without kids, I'm sure we'd have a range of discussion topics. Thanks for reading!

Warm weather is here and the parks are calling. And as the park ranger advises, it is best to always hike with a partner when venturing far, but that is easier said than done as people in my age group have grown sedentary. Ideally you are a woman, man or a couple, older than 50 years old, in shape and with time in your hands and the desire to enjoy nature. I'd prefer married people as I am but that's not a deal breaker. I am a moderate hiker.

hello all, 

I like to make some more good friends; 
It is hard to find honest and trustworthy people you can depend on 
life would be so much better and easier when you have good friends you can trust and depend on 

Looking for all types of people who are: cool, smart, intelligent, honest, dependable, geeks, dorks, shy, quiet, uncool 
I'm looking for good, honest, trustworthy people 

Please reply with a photo(at least 1 photo would be nice, but the more the better), and some comments, description, resume, etc about yourself(the more the better); also tell me what you are looking for and why you responded 

This group of people I make friends with can tackle lifes problems; you need good friends and family to be successful; family is a given; friends you can make and change; so I hope you take a chance to change your life for the better and maybe the following will come true: 
- more money; better financial condition 
- sucess in life 
- more good friends; be happier; have people that you can depend on and also you will reciprocate the help 
- advice on anything 
- etc; I will try to think of more when I repost 

if I get a lot of responses, it may take a while to respond so feel free to send another response 
I'm not looking to pay for sex or porn or webcams so please don't waste my time if that is what you want 

thanks for reading, 
hope to make a friend

And so, with all of the divisive talk about race and ethnicity in this years political debate, and a video that I saw on Facebook, I had an Ephipany. 

I don't have any people who are Caucasian, Hispanic, or other than African American that I would consider true friends. To be clear, we may work together or smile and walk by one another on the street. 
How can this be in one of the most multi-cultural cities in the world? 
And so, the only way for this deficit in my life to change is for me to aggressively try to diversify my friendships. This is a strictly platonic request. I love discussing politics (we can agree to disagree if necessary), hearing about the international travel of others, grabbing a beer or glass of wine, supporting the nonprofit community, going out dancing, listening to live music, trying new restaurants on H street and the Navy Yard (I'm open to other areas), and. hitting a few golf balls on the range (although I'm a novice). I'm a non-practicing Catholic from the Midwest. I'm pretty well educated (Masters) and I believe that laughter is central to getting through life. 

I don't know if we have anything in common, but I'd welcome the opportunity to meet with you on an upcoming sunny 70 degree day and discuss it. 

Hmm...have you asked yourself.. Do you welcome diversity in your life?

Good morning and I hope you are doing well. I am finally at the point in which I want to meet a woman in a similar situation. I am a MWM that is frustrated with my marriage. I have been through the counseling all all others avenues one would take. However, its not easy. What I am seeking (that's why I am in this section) is a woman in a similar situation and has the desire to have a friend. I am succesful in both my professional and personal life. I guess what it boils down to I the need for conversation, once we build trust and maybe, just maybe a little innocent flirting. I am open to the ages of 28 but no older than me 45. We need to have something in common. I am fit, handsome and respect my body and do not abuse it with drugs or smoking. I know its hard to look forward but in reality spring is right around the corner. Although this is a friendship discretion is a must! I am also open to a single woman that can relate or has been in this situation. Or simply a woman that wants to have some fun and make a new friend.

I originally posted this a few weeks ago but after some crazy replies I removed it. However, here I am again with hopes that I may find what I am looking for. Have an amazing day and I know you are out there!

Hello all, 

Quick stats: 31/m, Brown Hair, Blue Eyes (Glasses), 5'5"", and on the chubby end for mammals. 

Quick story: 18 year old kid knew everything there was to know. Couldn't be bothered to listen to anyone because he had grown up earlier than most (and sadly that's the truth), so naturally, he married the first woman he had sex with because he was a ""good Christian"" and astoundingly stupid. 

Flash forward six years. After working nonstop, dropping out of his Senior year at college, and divorce on the horizon (he was a terrible husband, but she should have kept taking the anti-depressants, it might have helped), a new chapter opened up. 

Lost a lot of weight. Then lost his job because in 2011, no one needed another ""Best Buy"" knockoff store in Colorado. Moved to Texas and then met another woman. Kind, responsible, and really good for this man. 

Unfortunately, in 2013, a brain tumor shredded the marriage. He had life saving surgery, but became epileptic (not a big deal), but the couple were never as close again as the stress of paying for neurosurgery, her Master's Degree, and his recovery was just too much to bear. 

They are still together and they are fast friends who do a lot together, but the romance is gone and the man is on what he calls ""autopilot"". And their problems aren't related to talking. They almost over share. Both know how the other fills, but romantically: round peg, square hole. 

So, here we are. She's finishing her degree, loving her job in DC, he put back on a lot of the weight (not all of it) and goes to therapy.

Surprise, the man is me! 

I'm looking for friends. I've always gotten along with women more. Not exactly looking romantically, but is not going to stop if it's right (which is horrible, but attempting to be completely honest). I have lots of interesting thoughts, discussions, love funny people, want to go out and dance, will watch a movie in the theater every single weekend and enjoy football as well as comic books. Also love kids and dogs. Have two dogs myself. Sadly no kids and it's a tough call if my other half wants that. 

Want to talk? Grab coffee? Write a screenplay together? Watch the sunrise or set? Act crazy at a dance club we don't belong in? Or just watch movies in the theater or my place (I work from home)? 

Hope you are out there looking for the same. You never know, maybe two people are wishing on the same star. 

Alejandro

Sorry for that title. I can show myself out after I put this up. I am trying to find a woman to chat with. Everything seems to have gone the way of short messages through txt and we seem to be losing the element of conversation and jokes through email. I miss it. Being able to type out a long one and have you respond with one of your own. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to go back to the stone ages and actually hand write out letters...but I might hand write you a note and take a picture on my smartphone and send that instead.

Hopefully you aren't too tired from setting the clocks ahead. If so, you can wake up slowly with your coffee, read this and say, oh yeah, that's the guy to write back to. He gets it. He will read all my stuff without judgement and ask for more. The perfect man...one who actually listens and wants to communicate. 

There are few fine print lines. Of course there are. I am tall. Blue eyes. A few bumps and bruises from a long career in the military and playing sports and other competitions. Salt pepper hair. Married.

Life is pretty much a solitary affair for me but I try to keep busy. I am happy with my hobbies and the friends that I do have, but looking for more friends and the opportunity for personal growth. My hobbies are important to me and include stamp and coin collecting and being an avid reader of non-fiction. I am currently reading ""The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World"" by Andrea Wulf. I especially enjoy reading biographies and the last biography that I read was ""Jung"" by Deirdre Bar. If you are in your 50s or 60s and are looking for a friend I would like to meet you. Please live in the DC METRO area.

Not sure if it's the weather or the water but I seem to getting very aroused of the thought of having another women and I'm not talking about a MILF or some toned gym rat but a normal women who lives a normal life that perhaps is missing some excitement and adventure. The thought of having a secret relationship with a women, who on the outside lives a wholesome cookie cutter life but behind closed doors she shares my secret. That we are lovers, that when time allows we meet even just to see each other and share a kiss, we email each other to stay in touch and when time and space allows, you let me have you. You can be married or single I'm fine with that just understand that I'm married and if you are to understand that I'm not looking to add drama or change your situation and in return you do the same.

I won't be posting any pictures for the obvious reasons but I can describe myself, 5'8, black hair, brown eyes, 180 lbs, short hair, facial hair at times and Afghan. I am dominant and I know what I want so if you are someone that keeps butting heads in life we won't get along.

You: Physically I don't have a requirement and I'm pretty open to race and age. However you have to be mentally normal. When I say normal no addictive/compulsive personality, don't be a creeper or a clinger.

Put ""Lover"" in the subject line so I know you are real

Hey everyone!

So...I've found myself in a situation where I've got way too many pairs of flip flops...way too many. I guess I've accumulated them over the years and now I'm stuck with a closet full. Some haven't even been worn!

Anyone else seem to have too many?
Do you wear them all?

I wear a men's size 9. If anyone (male or female) would be interested in having some or would simply like to talk about flip flops, what brands they like, etc...I am totally open! I am also willing to give them to a new home free of charge if you are friendly :)

Hope to hear from some laid back and cool people!

The only request just be sane, fun and open minded.

I'm seeking a female who is interested who wants to meet for ongoing massage session(s). It can be a one time thing or ongoing if we have chemistry. Again we can meet to discuss these things and get to know one another.

All I ask please be someone into a healthy lifestyle or into that. Meaning I don't mind if you are just getting into fitness or might be working on it which is typical. I don't expect perfect or someone who's always in the gym either. I am very fit and CLEAN I prefer the same. I exercise and always take pride in my body.


If you are feeling you want to experience an amazing magic hands massage to sooth some aches and pains I am great at focusing on pressure points too.

Please be OPEN MINDED and EASY GOING like myself. I just want to make it very straight forward I want to meet an open minded female who understands the power of massages.

I am seeking a counselor/coach type person -- female only -- and almost surely unlicensed, for discussion and dialog about relationships. But I seek a situation where you are comfortable with me being undressed, fully exposed, during our meetings and discussion. That's not allowed for licensed counselors/therapists, but unlicensed persons have more flexibility. I enjoy talking through my life issues with someone creative and empathic, and in particular am seeking relationship counseling. I am not seeking sex. But physical exposure and expression facilitates verbal revealing.

I have posted before, and have found someone very helpful to talk to, whom I do see on occasion. But I could benefit from additional dialog, and I'd prefer someone closer to home, which for me means Montgomery County. I'd prefer a location in or close to Montgomery County -- upper NW DC is okay, as is nearby PG county.

I am a single man, middle-aged. Apart from discussion about relationships and dating, you'll find that in such other conversation as naturally arises, I'm intelligent, curious, well-educated, thoughtful. I can be pretty funny at times.

I'd prefer contacts from counselors/coaches who are at least 30 or older, though a bit younger are welcome to make contact. But generally, more experience with life and dating, and closer to my experience, is likely to work better. In deep or personal conversations, I'm usually more at ease with white or Asian women (no disrespect to others, it's just my cultural base); but I am open to women of other ethnicities making contact and seeing where the mutual comfort level is. 

If you answer, please tell me about anything that you've done that's even kind of related -- former therapists and graduate students in counseling are encouraged to reply. But really any articulate, insightful, empathic woman may be right -- a businesswoman, an academic, military, also a massage therapist, nurses, female bartenders, or even an escort (but once again I am not seeking sex here, not intercourse or oral or any such thing here) -- someone with experience in listening to people on the job, may be right for this and for me.

Along with exploring relationship issues, this sort of experience is a chance for me to feel acceptance and companionship in the company of a woman. It's necessary that you be comfortable with a naked man, but also with possible arousal. I emphasize that there would be no sex, and that the conversation and dialog and coaching are a very real part of this, and very important to me. 

If interested, write to me and I can tell you more about what I'm seeking. I will offer reasonable hourly remuneration for your counseling, coaching and listening skills, and for the environment of acceptance you create. ($50/hour, possibly more, negotiable.) Please confirm your age and also confirm that you can host. 

If you're comfortable with it, you can provide a rough indication of where you are located. I would hope, if it works out, that this would be a once or twice a month type experience, ongoing for some time. I am really seeking someone in Montgomery County, MD.

I am not seeking a ""Domme."" A real counselor, even unlicensed, is still someone whom I pay, but who builds a genuine, personal connection, in the sense of really getting to know me and wanting to help me improve my life. If the connection works, a counselor/coach really develops a genuine concern for a client, and can, in a sense, celebrate with the client whatever progress the client makes in improving the quality of his life. I am seeking the kind of human bonding, support and connection that comes from a real counselor. If you are a Domme, either in private life or professionally, you'd probably be comfortable with all this, and I'd welcome hearing from you; but I am not seeking that side of your personality (nor your dungeon space).

Clearly of liberal stripe (already volunteering on the Sanders campaign). Lapsed Unitarian with buddhist leanings. I like riding around the DC and greater mid-atlantic/shenandoahs on my BMW adventure bike (See Ewan McGregor's ""Long Way Around,"" though I do tend to stay on pavement.

I have a flexible schedule and can usually make time throughout the day or evening with enough notice, and most of the Fairfax County indoor pools are convenient for me.

I also enjoy art and music (playing instruments) even though I'm a newbie at the guitar. I've played the piano and violin for a long time though. If you play an instrument that would be awesome! I'm an artist also but I haven't made anything in quite a while so if you are interested in that, that'd be cool. I can be pretty silly sometimes but I do enjoy fun people. I don't care about your gender, if you could just be in my age group that would be perfect. I haven't gone many places but I'd love to just go somewhere and hang out. I'm very open-minded to anything.

Hello, I'm an attractive, clean, professional white male who would like to find a female who likes to visit area casinos. Sometimes I may go during the week, but mostly it's a Friday or Saturday night. I will cover all room expenses and meals..... Of course I'm willing to meet first if you'd like. Any questions just ask. Thanks.

First of all that is NOT a hookup posting and NOT a sex thing. They say that a simple hug and even a cuddle can do wonders for people..I just miss having basic human contact..platonic contact. I'm a respectful person and always a gentleman and I can provide references upon request..lol. If I get any legitimate replies to my post I'll be surprised. 

But if someone genuine does reply that person and I can meet somewhere in public and meet first. We don't even have to cuddle that night...no pressure or rush..just go at whatever pace the other person sets.

Hello.
I'm a 22 year old woman who is a natural introvert and it honestly sucks as I'm getting older. I hate not being able to call someone if I want to see a movie or if I want to grab dinner. I'm fine with doing these things alone but as I get older I notice that my social life needs more. I'm a student at NVCC, studying criminal justice. I am seeking someone mature, cool and especially drama free. I don't care about your race or religion. Be around the same age. Just be a cool girl.

If chosen, YOU will be my first in this to fulfill my fantasy in double... It is important that all things fall into place and have a great time in the making :) ... You should be adventurous as we are looking for a third for preferably ongoing experiences...

About him... a lethal combination of tall, handsome, and sexy...
About her... a ginger with personality, beauty, and sexy to boot...

Both of us are Professional, very Good Looking, Athletic, DD Free, Non-smokers, Drinks Socially, and DO NOT Use/Do Drugs...

Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement... 
We expect to email, chat, exchange pics and speak on the phone prior to meeting... (photo and general information will be inquired to get to know you personally)...

SERIOUS INTEREST and INQUIRIES ONLY!!!... NO MALES... NO DRAMA....

Please note: Not looking to engage in convo that leads to a dead end, meaning that no progression is made so we can see were this might lead! Meeting socially to see if we have connection/chemistry with casual conversation, interaction and if we do we can go from there. If we do connect, great! If we don't, we can part ways respectfully... This could lead to an ongoing friendship and possibly more, but if it only ends up in one or more fun evenings out, that would be great too...

Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement (photo and some general information will be requested to get to know you personally)...

As for me, I like to think that I'm not hard to look at, and I can hold a decent conversation in just about any topic. I think you'd be glad you came out.

I hope to hear from you soon!

MWM seeking a Married or attached wire female for friendship and flirting. If you can relate to also finding this very discreet friendship I would love to hear from you. I am successful in every aspect of my life and simply looking for that one special lady that is missing the spark in her current relationship. I am an educated professional that is fit, does not smoke and has an occasional drink. I am great looking and take pride in my health and appearance and so should you. At 48 I am not perfect but still turn heads. I do not want to end my relationship that I have and neither should you. This is NOT about sex but some innocent flirting would be from. From there who knows but I would want to take this very slow. I am active in my community and in the County so discretion is extremely important.

How cool would it be to meet for coffee, go for a walk or sneak away for a few hours where no one knows us and have lunch. I totally realize this is risky but I can somehow justify this because I am not specifically looking for a sexual relationship. 

You may ask why I am in CL and the answer is simple. I have had opportunities to explore this type of relationship before but never moved on it because the circle of friends is small and I will not pursue this with anyone in the workplace.

Again, I would ask that you are fit, sexy and very honest. Summer is right around the corner and a perfect time for us to enjoy each other's company. 

Just think if this works how cool it would be to get a morning call, text saying good morning and I hope you are having a great day!!

Privacy would always be respected.

Have a great day!!!

Looking for hiking companionship, outdoor friends to explore all the trails this area has to offer.

Ever done the Billy Goat Trail on the MD Great Falls side? I'm looking to try more trails like that, Sugarloaf Mountain and Sky Meadows Park come to mind as well! Down for bike rides once the weather gets better, too. The CCT is a great trail but not exactly challenging, better for bike rides when it warms up.

I'm a 31 year-old SWM, interested in meeting similarly aged women, your status is unimportant as I'm simply seeking out platonic friendships with like-minded people that want to get outdoors! Cannot wait for warmer weather.

Are you curvy and smart? Do you like to cuddle? Have you a dire exigency (or perhaps just a mildly-pressing desire) to find a guy to engage in lively intellectual debates whilst enveloped in his arms and under a warm blanket in a comfy bed? Do you like run-on sentences and rhetorical questions? If you answered yes to at least three of these four questions, then read on oh stalwart Craigslist visitor!

I seek an erudite interlocutor and a curvaceous cuddle-buddy to ameliorate two poignant paucities in my life. So who am I and why should you care? Well here's what I have to offer.

•	I'm tall, dark, and not monstrously hideous!
•	I am big and cuddly, like a bear, but without the mauling and killing and tree climbing ability.
•	I'm not a bum! I have a place to live, a car to drive, a job to pay me money, and I don't even live in my mom's basement anymore!
•	I'm smart! You can show me off to all your friends and they'll be suitably impressed, or you can sic me on them to win all your arguments for you!
•	I have strong arms, a keen mind, a sharp wit and a *really* comfy bed with silk sheets and a super warm blanket!

Note that I'm pretty open as to what kind of relationship develops from this. Anything from friend to soul mate and future wife is just swanky. If you're interested, kindly reply with a picture and some information about yourself.

We could enjoy some adult beverages, cuddle and kiss and make out on the couch like teenagers. Cozy living room with music, a fireplace and soft throws to keep warm.

Please be well groomed, a nonsmoker, and openminded. I have a penchant for easygoing, Caucasian, Asian and Hispanic girl-next-door type but all good kissers may apply.

I am looking for young woman with an old soul. Someone to talk to who would enjoy the company of an thoughtful but aging man for conversation, people watching, motorcycle rides and fun stuff around the city this spring. But please note, I want to be your friend and companion, I do not want to be your sugar daddy. I do not even want to be your daddy. I have kids that I love and am not looking for another one. I understand that if you are younger you will be less financially ready to go out and spend money, and I don't mind paying for stuff, but there's plenty of stuff that we can do around the city that doesn't really require a lot of money. But I think it's na誰ve and condescending to think that the only way an older man and a younger woman can spend time together is by falling into either a sugar daddy relationship or a father daughter relationship. It seems sexist and ageist to think that way. I am divorced and I am happy with being single. I just like meeting different people and have dated and friended women from 18 all the way up to their mid 50s. When I was 15, my best friend was a 80 year old lady on my block who smoked Pall Mall unfiltered. I held her arm as we walked around the block so she could get her exercise. There are qualities to appreciate with everyone across the board, so please, no silly hate mail from haters who want to hate. I am very open to whom I meet and have ads that are for women closer to my own age. And I don't care much about your looks. Just be over 18, honest, kind, and sincere. As for me, I am tall, a deep thinker, a working DC professional but also dabble in art and music in my spare time. I like art, music, culture, politics, and like to get crazy just like anyone else. I am very open-minded and hope you are too. If you'd like to meet somewhere and talk about life, please say hi.

On a fairly regular basis, I see a beautiful woman or a woman with an incredible feature that I would just love to compliment. But you see, I can't. Not just because I'm married, but because it's 2016 and at least 8 times out of 10 if I told a woman she has amazing eyes, she would get totally creeped out. To me this is unfortunate. For many women (and correct me if I'm wrong here) this is interpreted as a forward attempt to sleep with that woman. I can see how a man would like to, but there is a difference between wanting to and attempting to. This is where I feel people get confused. Anyways, back to my original notion.

First, Craigslist is the sewer of on line dating. That said, there are opportunities to help you out.
1. Put in your physical description. A real one. This is the most important thing for male attraction. Don't use words like ""curvy"". Use real measurements like height and weight. Don't bother saying you are cute. That is up to us to decide.
2. If you skipped #1, go back and do that. There is another reason. Not including a description is what spam bots do. 
3. Don't mention wanting a ltr or ""serious guys only"". Every ltr starts off with a first date and most end right there. No shortcuts or spoilers. Take your chances and see what happens.
4. Don't mention your degree. Guys don't care. You are just wasting words.
5. Keep it short. Include just the basics, not your life story. The longer it is, the less likely anyone will read all of it. 
6. If you have a type of guy you prefer (age, body, race) then say so. Don't say ""race doesn't matter"". If you do, you just excluded the 2/3 of men for whom race does matter. And it doesn't matter if you say this because guys of all races will respond anyway.
7. Don't post in casual encounters. That is all spam bots so real men won't even read your ad. 
8. If you post in platonic section, don't say things like ,""friends first then more later"". That's guy code for, ""just sex"". 

Good luck to you all.

the idea is to have you become steeped
in regimens that emphasize your status
as a willing submissive . to help
you develop a mindset willing and anxious
to serve another , to prepare you to eventually
have an '' in-person '' Master. to be in a M/s relationship.

I am a married Hispanic male in my late 30's seeking to have a child with Woman seeking the same. 
My wife is older than I am and already had four children of her own, complete with a tubal ligation when we met and fell in love. We have been married for 17 years and she is very much supportive of my desire to have a child of my own. She does not plan to take on the role of another Mother, but does want to be referred to as the child's God Mother, as we believe this child will be a gift from God for all parties involved. 

I prefer creating this child with a single female or even a lesbian couple, but will also consider a heterosexual couple unable to have a child of their own. I prefer no other man in the mix because I do want to be an active Father in this child's life, however I would consider sharing the role of ""Daddy"" and would encourage you to contact me if you are such a couple that otherwise feels like it may be a good fit for all involved. I also prefer someone who doesn't live too far from Woodbridge VA, as the logistics will be a monthly concern. I am non-smoker, non-drug user and I do not drink alcohol. 

Please contact me via email if you are at all interested in taking this consideration to the next level. I so look forward to hearing from you.

WE are a COUPLE! Seeking a woman whom is interested in exploring some fun experiences with US TOGETHER... 

Looking to have my first experience with a female AND in a threeplay with the right female playmate... We are seeking chemistry, connection, and a female whom will be comfortable with US!

If chosen, YOU will be my first in this to fulfill my fantasy in double... It is important that all things fall into place and have a great time in the making :) ... You should be adventurous as we are looking for a third for preferably ongoing experiences...

About him... a lethal combination of tall, handsome, and sexy...
About her... a ginger with personality, beauty, and sexy to boot...

Both of us are Professional, very Good Looking, Athletic, DD Free, Non-smokers, Drinks Socially, and DO NOT Use/Do Drugs...

Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement... 
We expect to email, chat, exchange pics and speak on the phone prior to meeting... (photo and general information will be inquired to get to know you personally)
NO MALES... NO DRAMA....

Please note: I do not want to engage in convo that leads to a dead end, meaning that no progression is made so we can see were this might lead! Meeting socially to see if we have connection/chemistry with casual conversation, interaction and if we do we can go from there. If we do connect, great! If we don't, we can part ways respectfully... This could lead to an ongoing friendship, but if it only ends up in one or more fun evenings out, that would be great too...

Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement (photo and some general information will be requested to get to know you personally)...
NO MALES. NO DRAMA....

So if you are interested in being a playmate or even possibly part of a triad let us know. Please put ""Respectfully Yours"" in the subject line, include pics, experience, desires and expectations... Please feel free to reply to this email or Kik us if interested: my handle is VenusVegas...

I am seeking a counselor/coach type person -- female only -- and almost surely unlicensed, for discussion and dialog about relationships. But I seek a situation where you are comfortable with me being undressed, fully exposed, during our meetings and discussion. That's not allowed for licensed counselors/therapists, but unlicensed persons have more flexibility. I enjoy talking through my life issues with someone creative and empathic, and in particular am seeking relationship counseling. I am not seeking sex. But physical exposure and expression facilitates verbal revealing.

I have posted before, and have found someone very helpful to talk to, whom I do see on occasion. But I could benefit from additional dialog, and I'd prefer someone closer to home, which for me means Montgomery County. I'd prefer a location in or close to Montgomery County -- upper NW DC is okay, as is nearby PG county.

I am a single man, middle-aged. Apart from discussion about relationships and dating, you'll find that in such other conversation as naturally arises, I'm intelligent, curious, well-educated, thoughtful. I can be pretty funny at times. 

I'd prefer contacts from counselors/coaches who are at least 30 or older, though a bit younger are welcome to make contact. But generally, more experience with life and dating, and closer to my experience, is likely to work better. In deep or personal conversations, I'm usually more at ease with white or Asian women (no disrespect to others, it's just my cultural base); but I am open to women of other ethnicities making contact and seeing where the mutual comfort level is. 

If you answer, please tell me about anything that you've done that's even kind of related -- former therapists and graduate students in counseling are encouraged to reply. But really any articulate, insightful, empathic woman may be right -- a businesswoman, an academic, military, also a massage therapist, nurses, female bartenders, or even an escort (but once again I am not seeking sex here, not intercourse or oral or any such thing here) -- someone with experience in listening to people on the job, may be right for this and for me.

Along with exploring relationship issues, this sort of experience is a chance for me to feel acceptance and companionship in the company of a woman. It's necessary that you be comfortable with a naked man, but also with possible arousal. I emphasize that there would be no sex, and that the conversation and dialog and coaching are a very real part of this, and very important to me. 

If interested, write to me and I can tell you more about what I'm seeking. I will offer reasonable hourly remuneration for your counseling, coaching and listening skills, and for the environment of acceptance you create. ($50/hour, possibly more, negotiable.) Please confirm your age and also confirm that you can host. 

If you're comfortable with it, you can provide a rough indication of where you are located. I would hope, if it works out, that this would be a once or twice a month type experience, ongoing for some time. I am really seeking someone in Montgomery County, MD.

I am not seeking a ""Domme."" A real counselor, even unlicensed, is still someone whom I pay, but who builds a genuine, personal connection, in the sense of really getting to know me and wanting to help me improve my life. If the connection works, a counselor/coach really develops a genuine concern for a client, and can, in a sense, celebrate with the client whatever progress the client makes in improving the quality of his life. I am seeking the kind of human bonding, support and connection that comes from a real counselor. If you are a Domme, either in private life or professionally, you'd probably be comfortable with all this, and I'd welcome hearing from you; but I am not seeking that side of your personality (nor your dungeon space).

I'm a 27 yr old blk male recently getting back into working out again after falling off. Finding it a little harder this time around, so I am looking for another dude to go to the gym with me from time to time to work out, share advice and help each other in our fitness journeys. I live in Pg but my gym is in silver spring. My work schedule is insane so in always in the gym at inconsistent time. Maybe early morning one day or late at night the next. Looking for another guy maybe around my age and height 6'2, but not a requirement. Race is unimportant. The only thing I ask is know your way around the gym. You don't have to be a trainer or cock diesel (but would be great if you were Lls) but at least have some kind of knowledge and be serious about fitness. I also want to take it beyond just a gym buddy but possibly develop a friendship out side of working out. Hit me up with a pic and stats and let's get it in ASAP.

Midlife crisis? Trying to find myself? Reliving my youth? .....or maybe just bored? Who knows and who really cares! :) Yes, I am a married man who is looking for a very fun, flirty, spicy friend to flirt with and possibly meet on semi-regular occasions. I am very busy and you are, too, so our time is valuable and we would make the most of it. I am not looking to change my situation or yours, just add some spice to our life. Not looking for a girlfriend, 'other woman', concubine, or any other synonym for 'drama'. Just looking for fun, no more, no less. Flirty emails and talks are great and can be very hot foreplay. Discretion is a must and you will not know all about me and I will respect your privacy equally. 

You may ask why I am looking if I am married and why not just get a divorce. Well, some of you who are reading this are in a similar situation and know exactly what the deal is. For those of you who don't, well... I have been married over a decade and my wife no longer wants or gives attention. She doesn't like herself and therefore doesn't want attention from me. I have tried and still do but after a while the attempts get old. Factor in kids who don't deserve their life disrupted by separation/divorce, etc. and here we are. 

I am white (your ethnicity doesn't matter to me), 41, professional, keeping things together quite well compared to my peers, athletic, fun, intelligent, emotionally and mentally stable and secure, get my share of attention but never act on it and I want to find a friend who is outside of my own social and professional circles for obvious reasons. 

And you are?

I realize this endeavor has about as much a chance of success as my getting a job at Hooters (these A-minuses I'm rocking are clearly not going to blow anyone's doors off. . .or anything else, for that matter), but, well, worth a shot, right? I mean, it IS Craigslist. . .there are weirdos on here. Like me.

So, what brings me into this den of interweb weirdos? There's no way to say this without sounding douchey, so I'll just say it douchily (that's a word, right?): I need a cuddle. And I'm married.

Yes, I should theoretically get all the cuddling I need at home. But, sadly, circumstances in life seem to be conspiring against that happening, and it's been a long time (years?) since cuddling for the sake of cuddling happened, without all of the attendant pressures and stresses of life intruding on the moment. And I miss that. I miss what it feels like to just get lost in the moment snuggling with someone, feeling them pressed against you, smelling the scent of their hair, just reveling in being close and connected. 

I know what you're thinking--""Hey, dirty old married guy. . .you really just want skeezy sex, but are trying to disguise it as something innocent."" That's what I'd be thinking, too, if I were you. I assure you I'm not, but this is CL, and there are weirdos (like me), so why would you believe me?
Hmm. This may be an insurmountable obstacle. Nonetheless, let's press forward. All of you who are no longer reading might be interested. Or not. Since you're no longer reading.

I'm a 36-year-old white professional with brown hair and blue eyes; 5'9""; 150 pounds; generally pretty good smelling. Pretty good at cuddling (by my own reckoning, at least. . .perhaps that doesn't qualify as a ringing third-party endorsement). And I really want to just get lost, if even for an hour, in being close to someone, snuggling with someone, spooning, holding, etc. Life has been incredibly stressful lately, and that sort of contact sounds so relaxing, so amazingly therapeutic. . .sigh.

I know there are services for this sort of thing, and I've inquired, but haven't had any luck finding anyone who's schedule is compatible or who's close enough to make it work. And, it seems weird to pay for that sort of thing (not that I'm opposed to it), as it feels much better when the other person is just as eager to hold and be held. 

So, what am I looking for? Someone who wants the same thing (I should say a lady who wants the same thing. . .sorry, gents; nothing personal). Someone who's ideally available during the day and can host our snuggling. Someone who has a good sense of humor and will look at this the same way I do: a therapeutic modality that will give us both an escape from the stress of life for a little bit, and a chance connect with someone. 

I realize there's exactly 0 people out there who will fit that description, but there's always hope, right? Let me sweeten the pot: I WILL BRING COOKIES! Or whatever baked good tickles your pickle boat (is that a thing?). How can you say no to THAT? 

We could always meet for coffee or something beforehand, too, just to see if we feel like we want to proceed. Snuggling is intimate, and it might be weird to just show up and say, ""Hey, nice to meet you, little spoon! Get over here!""

If that sounds remotely interesting, I'd love to hear from you. . .I shan't hold my breath, though, as I'm not very good at that anyway. ;)

(Oh, and for those wondering...I really just do mean cookies. Apparently, as I've learned somewhat awkwardly, that word can mean something else on CL...)

This safe hands only massage will enable you to reach levels of arousal you've never experienced or even thought possible before. Relax and Enjoy the sensations of a Tantra Massage given by a handsome guy. 

Your body will be stimulated with skillful manipulation and technique that dates back thousands of years. This is an intimate massage unlike any massage you've ever had. 

The session begins with you lying face down as I relax you with a traditional sensual body rub. You will begin to feel stimulated and aroused. At this point the massage becomes everything but traditional. Your pelvis will involuntarily raise and lower to meet my fingers. As your excitement builds and my fingers become drenched with your arousal you roll over... 

Your body will feel electrified as my hands tease and delicately massage your nipples, your clit, and magical G spot. The pressure within you will build and build and build, until you EXPLODE and convulse in wave after wave after wave of multiple orgasms. The intensity of this type of orgasm will cause you to gush with a flood of vaginal fluid known as female ejaculation. 

You will feel completely drained and satisfied. If you've never experienced this type of massage, or multiple orgasms with female ejaculation, you must experience this.

This is for the person who asked about small breasts. I tried to reply and you took your post right back down. This is what I wanted to say.

I have to say that I am a breast man, but I don't like them too big. Sometimes women with big breasts doesn't always fit their shape. Now, I won't lie myself along with other men love to look at a nice cleavage...but because I have always been a breast man I also love small breasts. I dated two women who had small breasts and I loved their hard nipples. They enjoyed me sucking on them, which made me enjoy it even more. Now, both of them wanted to get fake surgery, and one actually did do it. I told both of them not to do it. 

If you are cool and have a good personality, it shouldn't matter if you have small breasts. A guy like myself would like you for you, and love your breasts no matter what size. You said that you wonder if yours were different would life be easier....well, maybe or maybe not, because some women have back problems, men staring too much and not paying attention to you, or having them in the way and pushing up against your chin at times. So, I say that to say it's not always a good thing.

I hope that I was helpful. Id you want to chat about this more, we can. Or anything else you want to chat about, or get an opinion about.


































Seeking validation. Sometimes I wonder if mine were different would life be easier? Curious to know if men out there are okay with it prefer smaller ones...thanks. No pics given. Subject line: mini

edit: so I went through a phrase of wearing a super push up bra and felt like I got more men willing to spend time with me, which then led to them realizing I was cool. No I will never get fake surgery but I am just saying...I hope my fears aren't true

Kathy: confession is good for the soul 

My significant other claims she can feel it: she has a feeling that I am cheating on her. Perhaps it's because lately I have been often late coming home to her. Plus I thought I was neatly sneaking out to ""have a drink"". However, it makes me feel good to see Kathy at our meeting place just waiting for me endlessly. I give her a 'quicky' then go back home. My girlfriend saw a text and asked me ""who is Kathy?"" 

Kathy is my little secret that I am keeping from her. I love my girlfriend, but I am cheating on her. She doesn't know Kathy, but Kathy knows her; she walks by her almost everyday. 

Kathy's lovemaking makes me feel like I want to do a cartwheel, and even though she knows I can't be tamed, she is always ready to give me some good loving. Honestly, deep down, Kathy's loving makes me feel like I want to change, even though I know I can't change. I have to split my loving between the two because my girlfriend always wants to fight and is watching me. 

I have to tell Kathy to act like she doesn't see me anywhere she sees me. My girlfriend went through my phone and she saw about 6 contacts with the name Kathy, so she just did that evil smile and told me I am too tricky. How is she going to tell me that I am definitely cheating when she never caught me? She says I am a fool but I am not that silly because I saved my top five contact numbers as Kathy.

Hi! For starters if you're a male, please stop reading and move to the next post.

Ok, now that that's out of the way, a bit about me; I'm married, have my Masters Degree, have a great career that keeps me quite busy and as a result I've found that after recently moving to Frederick I don't have many girlfriends. 

Hopefully there's another lady out there who like me has a job they love, a family they adore, but is short on female friends to grab dinner with, workout, talk, get our nails done, etc. My husband is amazing, but he's not exactly the ideal company to go on a girl's day with, to get our nails done, grab lunch and talk about the latest Philippa Gregory novel.

I've got a wide variety of interests from reading, history, sports (NFL and the UFC), movies, politics, cooking, board games, etc.

What I'd love to find in a friend is someone relatively close to my own age, so that we're at similar points in our lives, with similar hobbies. Bonus if like me you're working on losing some weight and getting into shape. I'm on the small side of BBW, capable of 5ks and hard gym workouts, hikes and just about anything else and it would be awesome to find a new friend to help each other stay motivated or to hit the gym with. If you're into any or all of the above things and just looking to make a good friend that you can hang out with, grab dinner, talk about whatever, please drop me a note and tell me something about yourself. I've taken some time to be fairly descriptive about what I'd like in a friend, please do so as well and don't hesitate to ask any questions either. Also please be local to Frederick, MD (less than an hour drive). Pen pals are great, but I'm looking for someone I can also hang out with in the real world.

Just as a reminder to any guys who made it this far, I posted in strictly platonic for a reason and with a specific kind of friend I'm seeking. Please respect that. Thanks!

I like giving slow, caring massages to make you feel good all over. I pay close attention to your body's needs. Through the bio feedback from your body to my hands, through skin contact, I adjust to where you need attention. This may mean going slower, pressing longer and holding, pushing, or being gentle.

Feeling your body relax through my touch is what I am looking for. Verbal direction is also very welcome and encouraged., whether to massage more gently, stronger, pressing and holding longer in certain areas. I hope you like what you read.

I'm not a professional. So I am not charging for these massages. Regular weekly massages are possible.

I'm in good athletic shape, attentive to your needs, and respectful.

Please be able to host. You can be single, married, or attached. Looking for women with a positive outlook on life and good hygiene. Showering before meeting is expected. I have good hygiene and you do, too. Athletes are very welcome, runners, weight lifters, crossfit, martial artist, and yoga practitioners welcome. Most importantly the every day nice woman is wanted. :) I'm athletic and understand how the body feels with exercise and can benefit from some massage, rest, good hydration and healthy food.

Thank you for reading. Please write and tell me what you are interested in, something about yourself, and where you are.

I'm real, gentle, here to care and pamper you for 60 to 90 minutes. What kind of touching and massage would feel good to you? Write and let me know. It is simple and easy.

Pairs of friends like roommates or close friends (females only) are also welcome for shorter length massages. If you're going out with your girlfriend and both of you want a massage (30-45) minutes when you get back home, I can massage both of you, one at a time of course. Both of you can talk and hangout while I massage one, then the other. Very relaxing idea.

I'm a sane, intelligent, emotionally stable, and free thinking guy who is looking for something very different. I would love to develop a long distance friendship/relationship with a woman who will be dating other men and sharing that part of her life with me. Ideally as we get to know one another you will come to think of me as your submissive and completely devoted phone BFF. I'm not looking for phone sex, this will be something much more meaningful and fulfilling for both of us. Our friendship will center almost exclusively around you, and when we talk it will always be all about you and what's going on in your life. I want to become your confidante and the one person in the world that you are comfortable enough to talk to about anything and everything, even other men. 

There's more to this, but by now you probably know already if this is something that interests you or not. If it does and if you like the thought of having a man in your life who will always support you and always be on your side, please write to me.

Hi Jeep Gal,

Are you a Jeep (wrangler) gal, with a nice personality, and experience with adding and removing soft tops from a wrangler? Do you want to make a new Jeep friend? Can you lift a hardtop off a 2-door wrangler with another person? Do yo have a snse of humor? ( You""ll need one!) 

I am looking for a new friend, someone who can help me remove the hardtop off my new 2- door Jeep Wrangler, remove the soft top from the factory without getting tied up into a pretzel, putting the hardtop back on with me, laughing, having a good time, teaching me what you know about soft tops on Jeeps, and making a new Jeep friend.

I could get the dealership to do this with me or herculean lift the hardtop on my back, but why nit make a friend with this? Yes, I am a guy asking for a woman's help. This means I am very secure. If you have the experience, I want your help. Well if you have a Jeep, you're probably cool. It's a Jeep thing. I have asked for directions before when I've been lost. It might have been after crossing into another coutry but still it counts.

This is platonic. I'm happy to return a favor simetime, or take you out for coffee, lunch, dinner, a s oothie, or ice cream. Roads are optional. ""Marty, where we're going, we don't need roads."" Tell me where this quote is from in your response.

I am posting here to avoid creeps and for decorum's sake.

I am legally separated, not yet divorced, after a long marriage that was without romance for the last fifteen years. I am still in the family home with separate quarters. The nest is almost empty.

Talking and listening to people I know well are my basic tools of happiness.



I like to dance 



I like to talk 



I like to listen 



I would like to have a friendship.



I like my job 



Therapy has helped me over the years

I am a professional with my own business 



I haven't had a drink or a drug in over twenty five years (and didn't have a drinking or drugging problem then!).



I believe in love

You don't have a pit bull.



You don't find this posting too affected, or at least you understand that I have to say something while being reserved.


You are still told you look like Catherine Deneuve (or how she used to look!). (JK)


When I have fears that I may cease to be
Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain,
Before high-piled books, in charactery,
Hold like rich garners the full ripened grain;
When I behold, upon the night's starred face,
Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,
And think that I may never live to trace
Their shadows with the magic hand of chance;
And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,
That I shall never look upon thee more,
Never have relish in the faery power
Of unreflecting love--then on the shore
Of the wide world I stand alone, and think
Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.

Have you ever felt like something was just not right with the world? As if you've been living a lie? If you ever seen The Matrix movies, then you know what I'm talking about.

Not saying that we all live in a computer generated world, but I do believe that metaphorically speaking, we do live in a Matrix. Some of the realities are created by other people, organizations and institutions. . .others are created by our own perception of things.

We've been conditioned to believe that only the 'lucky ones' achieve their dreams. . .that only a chosen few will be able to do what they want, when they want and with whom they want.

I call b.s. on that!

Because I have been awakened and I 'unplugged' from the Matrix, I see the world in abundance instead of lack. Now, are there real-life real-world problems out here? Absolutely! But don't get it twisted. . .we each have the power to make major changes in the world. . .but it starts with empowering ourselves, first and foremost.

With the help of fellow empowering part-time (and full-time) entrepreneurs, I get to impact thousands of people's lives from anywhere I choose as long as I have an internet connection.

If you are still reading this, then you may be the person I'm looking to lock arms with. But before I continue, let's take a trip down memory lane. . .

I was born in D.C., but grew up in Hampton Virginia. Growing up, the focus in my family was to go to school, get good grades, and find a high paying job. Pursing my passions was secondary to making sure I had education that would at least land me a safe and secure job.

You and I both know that there is no such thing as job security. And even if there was such a thing. . .it does not guarantee FINANCIAL security. As I learned in Robert Kiyosaki's book Rich Dad Poor Dad, it's not about how much you make, but how much you KEEP.

But I digress. . .so, through most of my scholastic years, I had been an honor roll student. It wasn't until my freshman year at James Madison University did I experience my first major failure. . .long story short; I got academically suspended and could not return for a calendar year.

I felt like a loser. . .how does one go from an A-B honor student to academic suspension? On the outside looking in, it would appear that the only way it could happen is from me simply not caring at all about my education...and that was far from the truth.

It was a shock to my ego, I'll admit. My friends asked were my parents furious at me because I failed so miserably. It was a surprise (even for me) to find out that they weren't furious at all. Perhaps disappointed, but that is my guess because they never expressed disappointment with me for doing so poorly in college.

But this goes a back to the Matrix thing. . ..my perception was that I was a loser, a failure, and that my parents were disappointed with me. . .all because of the expectations I had set for myself.

Fast-forward to 1996, when I decided to serve in the U.S. Navy after a year off from school and working a part-time job as a dessert prep/dishwasher. 

I basically still owed tuition to JMU as well has had to start paying back on the student loan (which wasn't even enough to cover the full tuition in the first place). Most of my buddies had gone into the service in other branches, so I figured the military couldn't be that bad.

I had a great time in the military; traveling the world, meeting different kinds of people. . .little did I know that this experience planted the seed of traveling as a lifestyle. Some of the places I traveled to were Colombia, Jamaica, Venezuela, Aruba, Germany, England, Denmark, Halifax and many more!

I used the time in the Navy to pay off my student debt as well as learn some skills in advanced electronics. I got honorably discharged after serving six years of service. After serving my time I decided to come back home to Virginia.

In 2002, I began work as a shipbuilder, doing electrician work. In the following years, I went from working outside in the elements to being in a climate-controlled cubicle. You would've thought I had 'made it.'

That was far from the truth.

I was not fulfilled.

I witnessed first-hand the office politics and was not down with it.

I have always been a free-spirited person. I do not do well with rules that don't make sense to me. To blindly do things just because 'they said so' never flew with me...especially when I found better ways of doing things.

I soon realized that just because it makes sense, doesn't necessarily mean that we're doing it that way. . .it seemed as if less things made more sense, the more we did them.

Have you had this experience at your job? If so, then you can feel my pain, lol.

It wasn't until after reading Rich Dad Poor Dad in 2007 did the ""entrepreneurial bug"" bit me. I knew there was more to life than working the 40-40-40 Plan (40 hours a week, for 40 years only to get a retirement check 40% of what I'm making now. . .which wasn't enough in the first place), but did not know exactly how to go about looking.

Reading that book opened my eyes to how the money game actually works. I found out why the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and why the middle-class is getting wiped out.

I made a DECISION to make a change.

It was time to let go of the old ways of thinking I had adopted from my elders (no fault of theirs. . .they didn't know what they didn't know and did the best they could with what they had, and I thank them for it).

After a brief dabble into real estate investing, I got introduced to the home based business industry. . .I've been hooked ever since. Now, it didn't come without challenges; and I've had my fair share. 

To name a few:
-I racked up over $70,000 in debt
-I lost my home to foreclosure
-I got my car repossessed twice in a year
-I got my lights shut off every 3 months for a year

As you can see, even though I was making decent money, I wasn't keeping much of it. A lot of it went to over-draft fees, late fees, living beyond my means via credit cards, etc.

I was pretty reckless with my money. I'm sure you know a couple of folks who've been reckless with their funds as well.

There are a lot of things I want to do. I have dreams of becoming financially free; to travel the world and learn different cultures; to take cruises and spend days on the beaches of the world under blue skies and palm trees.

I want to create MY OWN economy without having to depend on a job to do these things. . .and I don't want to have to wait 40 years to save up, only to have the freedom, but not the body to enjoy my freedom, if you know what I mean, lol.

And the best part of creating wealth is the ability to give more. I'm not breaking the bank (yet) but I have tasted what I felt like to earn income leveraging the internet in a way that I don't have to be present for every transaction.

I am building a business while having a life!

I'm not ashamed to say that I currently still work my 9-5, because I know that if my company were to let me go that I already have something in place working for me on my behalf (even as I type this message you're reading).

To have that peace of mind is priceless! I can now go to work without the stress. . .I can deal with the politics because I know that these shenanigans are temporary.

If you want to know more about my challenges and how I overcame them, feel free to add me as a friend on FB; holla at me:
https://www.facebook.com/valentinocrawford

Send me a message and tell me what YOUR DREAMS are and how making an extra income online will help you and your family.

I do read all of my FB messages because I do care. . .but I cannot want something for you more than yourself. I'm not the type to think I'm too good to answer messages. I was once in your shoes and I remember where I came from.

Your future self and your dreams are waiting for you; when will you make a decision meet up with them?

Peace,

Stop holding on to things that you feel you can't share without judgement. Stop carrying things that no longer serve you. When everything else seems so tough, and no one else seems to understand, let me be your soft place to land.

This is strictly for friendship! LESBIANS DO NOT REPLY. I am looking for friends in the Woodbridge area. It would be an A plus if you don't have any kids, in your late 30's single or divorced and you have your own vehicle . I am looking for a friend who can just get up and go, no worries finding a babysitter. I am not from VA. But I could see myself living in VA for the rest of my life. But I have no friends in VA. So I decided to try Craigslist to meet new people. I am a 38 year old AA Female Single With No Kids. I am easy going, fun, friendly, and drama-free . I enjoy going out for coffee, eating out, walking, exercising, going to lounges or clubs sometimes, and movies. I need a movie buddy! lol. If you need someone to talk to and get to know, if so let's meet up! Also have the same interests. Winter is here so I know a lot of people would not want to go anywhere. I need a friend who is willing to get out, of course if it's not snowing outside. Let's get ourselves out there and meet some men! I don't care about race. I do care if you are for real about this post. No bs. I know it takes time to get to know someone. I am not on here to meet people who just want to text and e-mail everyday and not planning to meet at all. Seriously if you're not thinking about hanging out soon please don't reply. 
Stay blessed.

Well, like most friendship ad posts, I am probably looking for a unicorn, but here goes anyway. One thing I've noticed about deep friendships is that they are usually only likely with peers from similar backgrounds, so I am attempting here to give some idea of who I am -- other than ""I like shopping, going to movies, eating out."" (I mean, who doesn't?) 

With that said, I am married with grown kids. I sometimes find single women not to be compatible with me. It doesn't mean we can't be, but when someone is fervently looking for someone special, being around someone who is already attached seems to get in the way of their personal happiness. OTOH, if someone is content with their relationship status, we tend to gel as friends. Because of my situation, I have free time during the day, so I am looking for someone who also has that freedom. Like almost everyone, I have an opinion about politics, but I dislike being around people who are on either end of the political spectrum. I enjoy social drinking. I enjoy working out. I'm not interested in being someone's motivation for getting into shape, so please don't befriend me with that in mind. I tend not to get along with passive-aggressive personality types over the long term. They are too emotionally shut down to be real with. I like being active, especially with all the wonderful places/things in DC to see/do. I like occasional random texting with people who have a dry, witty sense of humor. I enjoy cooking my own meals and eating fairly healthy, although I'm not maniacal about it. (That doesn't mean I don't like to eat out sometimes.) I don't usually hit it off with super-touchy, easily offended types. If you are that unicorn, maybe we can hang out while searching for that pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. No sexual trolls, please

Hello there,

So as the title says, looking for friends and/or if there's a connection, a relationship. As a person I'm pretty laid back, friendly, and sarcastic. I love to laugh, and can usually do a good job at making others do the same. I have a job, car, and a decent sense of where I want to be in the short term future.

I'm 24, 5'9"", 135lbs, gay, and live in the NoVa area. I can send a pic once we get to talking. I'm pretty active as a person, and with the weather getting better I'd like to be outside a bit more. Whether it's tossing a frisbee in a park or walking outside people watching, I'm pretty flexible and enjoy a variety of things. Equally, I do also enjoy being inside watching a movies, playing board games with friends, or just hanging out and chatting about nonsense, lol. I do at the moment have a decent circle of friends, but wouldn't mind adding someone new in my life (preferably someone outside of DC would be nice, though I go there often too). Lastly, like the beginning said, a relationship would be great too if it comes to that.

Anywho, before this gets any longer, lol, if this post piques your interest feel free to send me a message. I posted this in the m4m section, but if you're a girl and happen to see this you can send a message as well. :)

If you send a pic, I'll send a pic as well and go from there. Hope to hear from you. :)

Hi there! So like the title says (Spoiler Alert) I'm gay (Haha) and looking for a female friend. :) I have a decent circle of friends, however, 75% are male. Adding a female to the circle would be nice...and I suppose this is where you come in! Lol.

A little about me, I'm 24, 5'9"", and live in the NOVA area. I can send a pic of myself if we get around to talking. In general I'm a pretty nice person, like to laugh, friendly, sarcastic, and get along with most people. I have a job, a car, and pretty stable with life. I'm also active too, and like to do stuff like play frisbee, kickball, hiking, etc. With the weather getting better it would be nice to do more outside. Though, I'm just as cool with doing indoor stuff, like going to the movies, eating out, shopping, etc.

So yeah, if any of this piques your interested, send a message and I suppose we can get around to talking and maybe become friends. Hope to hear from you. :)

Do you, or know a friend that does professional WAX in a salon or a spa in the Montgomery County area? Reason I ask is because I wanted to try to find someone that would attempt to wax my scalp. I've asked a million times in a salon - nobody will touch it (from the videos I've seen, it may take a few hours or multiple sessions). Anyway, I figured maybe I could find someone that waxed professionally and see if they could try it sometime after work. Thanks!

Me - 47 but in the shape of a 27 year old. I workout, kickbox, run track and trails, do crossfit, play tennis, swim and soccer. 

I am looking for a female buddy who has a discipline for staying in shape who would like to join me for outside crossfit workouts now that the weather is getting nice. I can do sat/sun late mornings, and evenings 1-2 days during the week. With schools still in session, need to work around field and track practice schedules for weekdays but weekends seem pretty wide open.

I bring travel weights (long bar and dumbells), jump ropes, agility cones, and a few other pieces of equipment to the local Quince Orchard HS where I can easily back up to unload my equipment near the track.

Routine is about hour/hour and 15 mins. My typical workout includes intervals of weights, quarter mile runs, calisthenics (pull ups, push ups, rope, etc), and some agility work with cones. I can guarantee I will have you sweating like never before, and looking your best within 4-5 workouts....crossfit tones and strengthens you fast and like to other workout combo. So come out and join me..and feel the burn!!!!

If interested please get back to me. Thanks!!!

I used to have a great concert buddy. We introduced each other to different groups and went to shows that nobody else would go to. We got to be more general friends. It was a great. 

Now she is in California or something. In any event, not here. I find shows I'd like to go to, and I have nobody to go with. You know cool shows and want to invite me. Why aren't we friends?

About me: I am 30s, 6'3"", fit, and attractive. I'm a nonprofit lawyer/policy wonk. You know the type. My first love is 90s hip hop. I grew up in Seattle, so even if I once tried to deny it, I like stuff with, like, guitars and stuff too. Stuff. I loved the O Brother, Where Art Thou soundtrack and some bluegrass kinda stuff. Jazz. I love Jazz. The 930 Club is one of my favorite places in DC. My old concert buddy took me to see Cold War Kids. That was awesome. In short, I'll go see anything with you

Are you cute? Do you like music? Like maybe obscure stuff sometimes? Suggest shows to me, and I'll cover tickets. I'm going to see Del at U Street Music Hall in May; maybe that would be a good start. Come to shows I want to go to so I don't have to be that guy alone and nursing a beer while I wait through down time between acts. It will be fun. And if it's not--you can disappear into the crowd and never see me again.

So cards on the table, here is what I'm looking for: someone witty and bitingly sarcastic who knows how to use a semicolon, who shares my cynical world view while also seeing the inherent goodness in humanity. She should be fit and easy on the eyes. I want to chat during the day and share occasional happy hours. And, if it all works out and we connect, I want to go down on you--no reciprocation necessary; I would eagerly engage in post orgasm(s?) cuddling at your discretion. This would, of course, only follow serious chemistry establishment.

Here's the catch: I am tall and fit and attractive. That's not really what one typically means by a ""catch,"" you say? You haven't been on craigslist long, I retort. I'm also witty and charming and respectful of normal social mores. That is to say, I am confident that even if our banter only lasts three emails and you change your mind, you won't be permanently creeped out. Seriously, I am a great guy with a particular need. Stranger things have happened.

I mean, give it a shot. Worst case: you trade a couple of emails and decide I'm an idiot. Best case: you make a new friend who will make you laugh and give you mind blowing orgasms. High upside.

So what are verbal benefits you ask?? Well I'm seeking someone that's a good communicator. Someone that's open minded and willing to talk about nearly any subject. Someone that's honest and tells it like it is without sugar coating it. Someone that will hold her end of the conversation and ask plenty of questions in return. Someone that intrigues me, makes me laugh, makes me think, makes me want to explore you more. 

I would prefer if you are 30-50, but you don't have to be. 
I would prefer if you are married or attached, but you don't have to be. 
I would prefer if you are attractive, but you don't have to be. 
I would prefer if you are somewhat local to the DC area, but you don't have to be. 
I would prefer if you are a female. This is a must, no buts allowed. Lol

As for me, I'm married, 40 years young, father, professional, smart, fun and playful, active, handsome, open minded, flirtatious, sarcastic, and eager to develop a new friendship. I'm open to meeting down the road if we connect but perfectly happy to keep this online only. 

One last request, if you want to talk, please make your response interesting. ""Hi there"" responses aren't responses. 

Looking forward to hearing from you

My colleague and myself are hosting a poker party on Saturday, April 9th from 7:00 - 11:00 pm. The poker party consists of my law colleagues: lawyers, paralegals, support staff, and vendors. We hold this semi-annual poker party as a way for us to unwind, play some poker, and just have a good time. 

We are currently seeking 3 to 4 women to serve beverages, alcoholic and non-alcoholic, that we provide, serve food (chips, hors d'oeuvres, pizza, etc.), which we also provide, and to add a certain fun and entertaining environment for the players. The servers pretty much set the tone of the party, however, the eveningt revolves around the game itself. The female servers should be fun, personable, and gregarious. The attire for the servers will be black bikinis and high heels (which we do not provide). 

The compensation for the event will be $25/hour, which totals $100 for the whole event; this will be paid upon arrival. Also, in addition to the compensation, you will receive tips from the poker players themselves. 

If interested please email me your first name, a picture, face and body shot (NOT NUDE), and an email address where you can be contacted.

Ladies,

Are there certain sides to you or even things that you secretly like but are too shy, afraid or embarrassed to admit to the people you're close to because of the feeling that they'll misjudge you or start looking at you differently, think that you're weird because of what you like and/or don't like? Is there anything that you would like to do with someone or would want someone to do for you but in your mind you feel that whatever it is may creep them out or that they will immediately decline because of whatever the request or desire may entail? Feel that others will not ever truly understand and accept the real you so you keep the real you hidden within?

Well fear not... you are not alone. I'm just like you. I love meeting new people and will gladly share my interests, passions and desires with anyone who is willing to listen and accept me for who I am and what I like and/or dislike. I do not judge others for their quirks and I certainly try not to knock something before trying it. After all, you could end up liking or disliking it too and can therfore see things from another person's point of view.

With that said, ladies please feel free to send a reply. Don't be shy. Let's be friends and get to know the real us through one another. Share with me your personality, your lifestyle, your likes and your dislikes. I will gladly share with you the same. Who knows, maybe I might like and or dislike the same things that you do and vice versa. Let's chat!! :-)

THAT BEING SAID, I am not one to shove my baggage on others. I am good at tucking it away for when I am alone so I don't need someone to rant or vent to. I need some friends to hang out with- hit Phase1 or Cobalt. Freddy's for a lunch. Gear up for the Pride events in June which I usually like to try and volunteer for. I need some friends who are as social as I am because I refuse to sit and suffer. onto bigger and better things and hopefully a few hot girls along the way.

If chosen, YOU will be my first in this to fulfill my fantasy in double... It is important that all things fall into place and have a great time in the making :) ... You should be adventurous as we are looking for a third for preferably ongoing experiences...

About him... a lethal combination of tall, handsome, and sexy...
About her... a ginger with personality, beauty, and sexy to boot...

Both of us are Professional, very Good Looking, Athletic, DD Free, Non-smokers, Drinks Socially, and DO NOT Use/Do Drugs...

Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement... 
We expect to email, chat, exchange pics and speak on the phone prior to meeting... (photo and general information will be inquired to get to know you personally)
NO MALES... NO DRAMA....

Please note: I do not want to engage in convo that leads to a dead end, meaning that no progression is made so we can see were this might lead! Meeting socially to see if we have connection/chemistry with casual conversation, interaction and if we do we can go from there. If we do connect, great! If we don't, we can part ways respectfully... This could lead to an ongoing friendship, but if it only ends up in one or more fun evenings out, that would be great too...

Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement (photo and some general information will be requested to get to know you personally)...

So if you are interested in being a playmate or even possibly part of a triad let us know. Please put ""Respectfully Yours"" in the subject line, include pics, experience, desires and expectations... Please feel free to reply to this email or Kik us if interested: my handle is VenusVegas...

Here it goes:

I'll likely be chaperoning my son's field trip in May and after his symphonic performance, the kids are free to roam all day long (without parental supervision) meaning I'll be by myself all day. It would be ideal to have someone meet me at the park so we could essentially hang out all day. I LOVE roller-coaster's but don't want to end up going on them by myself. It's so much more fun when you have someone to share the thrill with. Typically I wouldn't really mind about your age, but in this case I do prefer you be around 28-35 age range and definitely ""fit enough"" to not be told you can't ride on the roller-coaster because the seat belt won't lock lol.

I'm very cute and fun to be around so I would expect the same. I'm not looking for anything serious, just 2 good looking people having a good time. The exact date will be determined soon, but it definitely IS on a Friday. So come on whatta ya say? Let's have fun together! 

I won't respond to one liners, so please let me know why you would be interested in going, etc etc. Feel free to attach a picture and I'll reciprocate if I think we would hit it off. Either way let's chat and see if you want to be spontaneous for the day. 

Talk soon!

Hi! Thanks for reading my post. I am known around the city by a lot of the museums and galleries. I attend lectures on a regular basis. I usually like the big names and famous people with international recognition. I enjoy lectures on art, physics, poetry and many other subjects. I sometimes talk a little rapidly, but for those with an interest in what I am talking about it usually is well received. For instance, this morning I was having a lovely exchange with a barista putting on a presentation on four types of coffee she was brewing and we discussed different types of beans a and brewing techniques. I also was talking with a lovely architect from Wisconsin and we were toe to toe in discussing the development in Washington, with different architects and developers. Then I briskly hung out at SAAM for some coffee, tea, and to ride their WIFI in the LUCE area of the gallery. Then, I ran to the NGA for a classical mandolin concert with an excellent percussionist, with a dessert of one of the last documentaries of a famous icon in filmography. This is actually being written unbeknownst to me in fictional form by a friend of mine trying to set me up. 

If you like to solder or stand in lines I'd love to buy your old solder gun, or pay you to stand in line for Congressional hearings/ All jokes aside, if you like art and running around the city I am always availed to company.

This post if for my friend. Yes, I am a match maker like the movie, ""Fiddler on the Roof."" But, this is about him and not me.

6'2, thin swimmer's build, blond hair, with a very mild mannered look about him. He actually has great endurance too as he rides his bicycle to and from the city for arts and cultural events to include, tech start-ups, art receptions, conventions, ceremonies, independence days, lectures, etc. If it has a good reception, then more than likely he is interested. He also likes to memorize poetry and is able to recite it. He sells used books and frequents estate sales, libraries, and all sorts of places with dust and the smell of old things. You can also find him on Sunday at the flea market in Georgetown selling his jewelry which is another side job of his. He also does a d.j. show playing music of his choosing usually with some quirky poetic messages usually with strong female roles such as Goldfrapp.

I think, but I could have the wrong author, but he likes the Emily Dickinson look. WASPY, nerdish, plain, dry lips, a bit odd, awkward, au naturel in all ways, shy, people are somewhat his type. We recently saw a movie with Anne Heche and he found her short hair and disco dancing hot. 

He is somewhat in a ""Catch 22"" situation as he never approaches anyone, and the type of person he likes would never approach him. So, he is left memorizing this poetry with no one to recite it to.

Hello Land of the Free! You don't even know how much you've been missed.

This is a request. Or maybe... several requests.

First off, if you are not familiar with a lot of the new research that been established, please take some time to do so.

The National Institutes of Health has determined by way of PATENT 6630507 the MANY benefits and potential benefits of the cannabis plant. To understand why this is not more widely available information- would be a completely different task... but not at all separate , so please, pick whatever ways and means suit you best. Just please don't be uninformed anymore...

That being said, we are medical refugees, not political refugees. Not yet anyway. Again, that would be an environment that I do not have experience in. I try to stay informed as best I can while also remembering that there are usually two sides to every story- and somewhere in the middle is often where the truth will lie. And the further away you are from an event- the less you will actually know about it. So I'm not too far away from... NIH... or a politician that actually seems to be ' getting it ' , along with the integrity to back up her words. As I am grateful for that, unfortunately, we are not close enough.

We are just across the river. Strange that I've been here almost my entire life- but don't think I know anybody on the other side. And a nuisance to try due to the high traffic and expense that it has always been to visit Our Nation's Capitol- again, an argument that I am only prepared to complain about- with no authority or expertise to make much more of a concise argument other than ' I don't like it. '. But along with any of those arguments, as an ordinary citizen, I can sense a large political divide between the neighboring areas. Even within my own Commonwealth, which is significantly larger than the D and the M portions of this tri state ( DMV ) area put together. From my experience as a constitute of Northern Virginia for so long, I would bet that there would be very little progress towards some of the initiatives that have already been established (and in the Districts recent case, trailblazed) in the neighboring States concerning the use of medical cannabis.

In my advancing years, I have always served myself and learned what works best for me- , mentally and environmentally- as people generally do while... living their lives... furnishing their homes, choosing their careers, cooking their food, deciding what to wear, investing, raising their children and voting, etc. I have realized the benefits that cannabis has provided for me while struggling with anxiety, ADHD, and the side effects of the medications typically used to treat these disorders - even prior to the research of the benefits of cannabis used for these conditions was established. But the issue has never been raised in the Commonwealth on any significant scale outside mostly just conversations amongst like minded people. So I include myself in that, shake my head a lot and go on serving myself and my family.

A couple of years ago, my daughter presented with severe inflammation in all parts of her eye and into intra cranial hypertension- essentially diagnosed as idiopathic. The doctors believe that it is considered an auto immune disorder- which in many aspects is also considered idiopathic. And the ' treatments ' of many auto immune disorders are pretty intense, including chemotherapy and other immune suppressant pharmaceuticals that have less than a couple of decades worth of research backing them. After a couple of years of these treatments - with no real improvement- it seems as if the experts are satisfied with 'maintaining', slowing the progression of, or prolonging what they idiopathically THINK is inevitable.

While conducting my own research, my daughter's conditions are collectively considered ' secondary glaucoma '- a condition that has been treated with cannabis for a very long time.

And with the recent discoveries made in the properties of the cannabis plant that reduce inflammation and treat autoimmune disorders, it would be only logical for me to want to try this method for my daughter who has had no success with pharmaceutical treatments- but only negative side effects.

The cannabis plant has also been proven to alleviate the negative side effects of chemotherapy- so again, why wouldn't I want to pursue this treatment for my daughter? 

And why anyone would engage me in a debate while my daughter is going blind?

Because the research is in. Many of the beneficial properties of the cannabis plant do not even include the THC component- the part that produces the 'high' that many people associate with the cannabis plant. And of course, these patients do not generally get their medication in a form that they have to smoke.

As a desperate parent, I have conducted some rather intensive research on how to help my child. I discovered a few ' loopholes ' in order to get my daughter approved as a medical marijuana patient. Which, with the help of a few more progressive States- I was essentially able to accomplish... but only as close as Oregon. Which seems a bit absurd to me if I can't even afford a trip across the river...

In this trying economy, it has been challenging for just about everyone. Especially for those who were financially disadvantaged to begin with. About the worst time imaginable to be dealing with a chronic and idiopathic disease. Particularly with the enormous cost of specialists and medications... that AREN'T working!!! 

Because of all of this now, along with some other life changing events, I have essentially found myself homeless- although I have been established in Northern Virginia almost my entire life, I have been able to survive with a little help from my friends.

My primary focus of course is my daughter's health.

A move across the river would probably not be too inconceivable- although I do not have the means ( finances, credit or contacts ) in the District to get myself established. Nor do I feel that I have the luxury of establishing a 1 year residency in order to get the help that I need. I understand The District of Colombia has an enormous homeless population. I don't see where I could get much help going from being homeless in a place where I am familiar and established to being homeless in a place where I know no one or have nothing.

I am- aside from having the obligations of caring for my daughter, essentially- employable in any of my previous occupational fields- and anxious to resume whatever kind of normalcy I can achieve given our current circumstances. What I am asking for here is a chance at that possibility.

If there is anyone, anyone at all- that can... relate... or possibly assist in any way- I am open to any suggestion.

I am a 44 year old, single mom- with no criminal history whatsoever, just trying to help my daughter lead a normal, healthy life.

I am open to ideas, information, leads, employment and the opportunity to meet anyone in a position that could possibly help... or who may need some help- in exchange for a usable address in Washington DC so that I can try to save my daughter's vision.

In the meantime, thank you for your attention and good health to all. Regardless of your zip code.

Hopefully

Hey y'all! 

It's spring break! Well, at least it is for me. It'll be warming up soon (Hopefully), so that means swimsuit weather! Only problem, shopping for said swimsuit. Yeah.

I'm looking for a FWB type of situation with a mature, intelligent, sexy, confident woman with curves. Someone who misses those feelings (tingling all over) you get right after making a ""connection"" with someone. That excited feeling you get when you receive a new email, text, or call from your secret lover. Being aroused when you hear their voice or see a new sexy photo they've sent. Constantly yearning for the next time when you can be together and thinking about them when you go to sleep each night. Basically, I miss the hunt and all the things that go with that. If you're married or attached, no problem as I am too however, the passion died years ago. I promise discretion is just as important to me as it is to you. 

Being verbal when making love, enjoy wearing sexy lingerie, love receiving oral and sitting on a mans face are all +++

With that said, here's a bit about me. I'm a 53 year old athletic, easy going, uninhibited, adventurous, DDF, MWM with a very high libido. I enjoy meeting new people, good conversation and if we seem to have a mental connection, I'm definitely open to seeing if we have a physical one as well. I'm a very giving person as I get pleasure out of giving pleasure. I enjoy long sessions of foreplay and teasing as it helps heighten arousal. I can be slow and sensual or more aggressive and somewhat kinky. I would also be interested in switching roles I you like. 

Anyway, if you're interested, please get back to me and we can chat more. Please include a pic or two and change the subject line to your favorite color to weed out spam. 
Have a great day!

Don't know where all the time has gone. You wake up one day and you realize you are not happy with your life. You feel like something is missing. You find yourself sleeping walking through life. You have a busy life, your married, but you just go through the motions. You miss laughing, joking, romance, sparks. You yearn to find someone that can fulfill that void. Someone you can trust. Someone you look forward to communicating with. Someone to put pep back into your step. Someone whose kiss sends shivers through out your body. Does this describe you? It does describe me and I would like to experience those feelings again, even if they lead to nothing more than a beautiful friendship, built on communication and mental intimacy.

As the weather will be changing really soon, it makes me think of all the fun I want to experience this spring/summer. Although CL can be an awkward place to meet potentially good friends I thought i'd give it one last try.

A little about me, I'm outgoing, open minded, employed and will be in school part time. I like to explore new places, I love all types of music, love to cook, shop, get my nails done, sip red wine and watch movies, talk about current events. I find the beach peaceful, I love to travel, I like to write from time to time, I love chill atmosphere's and I recently started working out again and it'll be a plus if you would like to go walking at a track or trail since the weather is getting better.

Hello!

Although Craigslist isn't the ideal place to find friends, when you're an introvert who has absolutely no social activities they engage in it is pretty much your only option (as far as I know they haven't made a Tinder for best friends for life yet). So it's a little awkward but it's worth a shot. 

I'm 22 year old white female nurse. I'm happily married with no kids (although we are trying to have one...so somebody in a similar life stage would be awesome). I'm an avid pole dancing enthusiast (have been out of practice the past few months but working on getting back into it.) and enjoy shooting at the NRA range (I'm a newbie but it's fun!). I also enjoy reading when I get the time and of course all the things that most girls love: shopping, getting my nails done, eating out, etc etc. I'm very driven in my career and would prefer to meet someone who also takes their career seriously. I watch very little TV, and I think there is a lot of more productive things you can do then sit in front of the tube. I identify as bisexual but I really just looking for a friend. I did the fwb route and it really just ended in a lot of heartache, so instead of having a fwb who may last for a little while, I'd prefer to develop a friendship that lasts a lifetime. 

In a friend I'm looking for someone who is preferably attached (married, engaged, etc) as I have had more success in the past with friends who aren't ""on the prowl"" so to speak. Like I said earlier in my ad, my husband and I are trying to conceive so someone in a similar life stage would be nice. Other than that, I just ask that you be intelligent, be able to hold a conversation, mature, honest, driven in whatever it is you do in life, and open minded. Let's be fun/silly/quirky together. I have a flexible work schedule that allows me a lot of time during the week to do things (perks of being a nurse!). I want someone who would be just as content to come over to my house and watch/help me organize a room as they would be going out to the mall together. It seems true friendship is rare these days but if I could just have one truly good friend, I would be happy. I don't want someone who is super clingy and needs constant attention, but having someone to chat with on a daily ish basis would be cool. 

Send me a bit about yourself (more than one line please!!), what you're looking for, and a picture (helps to know who you're talking to). I'd preferably like to text/email back and forth a bit before we met as I am introverted, but once you get to know me I'm loud, fun and quirky. I'm the subject line put your favorite movie. Mine is Silence of the Lambs. 

Looking for in a similar age range as me too 20-35? 

I'm curious to see what the Craigslist gods bring me :D



No men. No couples. No mouth breathers. Thank you!

I have almost everything I could want in life except a female best friend. I don't usually get along with with other females because I usually am just one of the guys. If you've felt this way, read on.

I'm sassy. I'm crass. I like to laugh (loudly). I make fun of people and don't mind being ribbed in return. I dance like no one is looking all the time. I talk to strangers regularly. I'm a people person. I enjoy impromptu get togethers. I'm also a pierced, dyed haired (sometimes), big geek at my core, not because it's ""in"" right now but because that's what generally interest me. I could care less if you wear makeup and fashionable clothes and care more about if you're fun and a good person. I also identify as a kinkster. I won't impose it on but feel if I really want to find a good friend, it's something they should know since it's a part of me.

My fave things are...
Netflix binge sessions
Planning my zombie apocalypse escape plan
Aimless current event talking with music playing in the background
On the fly mini road trips

If any of this sounds like you or you're looking for this type of friend then you should write me. I'm a loyal and dependable friend and most of my circle of friends I've known for years. I'm just hoping to add a ballsy female like myself to my group.

Want to know more? I'm happy to share. Just shoot me a message and we'll get chatting. I don't mind taking some time to get to know you online before meeting but am not looking for endless emailing. If you're into drama, self-loathing, being flakey (read: being excessively late to things ugh), and generally making everything about you, we most definitely shouldn't cross paths. Also I'd like to find someone who doesn't have children (more flexibility) and isn't entirely new to this area as I don't like playing tour guide/

Well rounded girls, fellow kinkster girls, and geek girls get quicker responses. Hope to hear from you!

How's it going? Here's wants going on I'm going on a birthday get-away for a close friend to Atlantic City NJ Friday March 11th - 13th with a couple of professional working friends, the group that you see in the pictures above is them. It's going to be alot of fun and we will be going out maybe almost every night my friend's birthday is the 21st but we'll be celebrating his birthday next weekend.

What I'm searching for:

I would love to find a charming, respectable, fun female age 22-30 who will love to come with me and keep me company with my friends it's not me trying to start a relationship it's so I don't feel left out when everyone and thier dates have fun for the entire night. Drinking,Strippers etc will be happening so please be open minded and at least a social drinker.

The Cost & What's In It For You:

Well, first and foremost I'm not looking for a female who's seriously picky. However I will probably be getting a room with double beds and most likely probably driving with my best friend or maybe getting a rental car not sure yet to Atlantic City NJ which is only 3 hours away. One thing for sure if I'm down to the wire I'm willing to pay/ reimburse you for your time with me on this get-away. (Also would be great to have a new friend) We will need to meet this weekend to talk more about details.

Just wonder about Craigslist and dating. I have posted a couple of ads and except for spam, got zero replies both times. 

I'm supposedly everything most women say they are looking for. In other words a great catch.

So as a woman, do you ever respond sincerely to ads men post? 

Thank you very much for your help and talking the time to reply!

Straight older bro looking for a straight younger bro.

I'm 31 straight, fit, masculine, told I'm good looking. I like to do a lot of outdoor sports like camping, paintball, biking, tennis, swimming. I workout a lot. I like going to pro sporting events, but I don't necessarily follow sports. 

All my siblings are much older than me and live in a different state. I've always wanted to have a younger bro to hang out with. I'm looking for a straight masculine guy from 18-28. If you could use an older bro let me know. Nothing weird!

Lets Meet at the Sculpture Garden for some ice skating. 

It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or Olympic caliber-- just have the desire to get out, enjoy the ice and get a good workout. 

As of 2/9/16 I've gone to the Sculpture Garden about 35 times since it opened for the season on 11/14/15. I love the exhilaration and pleasure that ice skating brings. After skating, we could stop into the cafe which is adjacent to the rink.

These days/times are best for me. Just let me know what works for you.

Monday evenings 7:00-9:00PM 
Tuesday mornings, afternoons or evenings 
Wednesday mornings, afternoons or evenings 
Friday evenings 7-9, 8-10, or 9-11 
Saturday evenings 7-9, 8-10, or 9-11 
Sunday evenings 7-9 

I'm single--very fit, healthy, fun and have a youthful look and mindset. I guess I'm an intermediate skater -- way beyond a beginner but nowhere near an expert. I live in Old Town, Alexandria. When the outdoor rinks close in mid March, my skating will be at the Mount Vernon Rec Center (2017 Belle View Boulevard Alexandria, VA 22307)

What does your Friday have in store for you? I'd love to know! Are you in the same position as me? You have that empty space in your heart that you know deserves to be filled but time after time things always seem to end the same? Empty. I'll be 30 before I know it, and have a lot to look back on and be happy and proud about, but as of now I don't have that one part of my life I thought I'd have figured out by now for sure, and that's finding that special someone. 

I could type pages of myself, my life, what I'm looking for, but all of that seems a bit ahead of itself. I'll keep it simple for now. I'm a sweet, caring, loving guy who has a heart bigger than the world to give to someone that has the same to give in return. I've been told several times from previous relationships that I'm not like anyone they have met. Let's start slow, with the simple things, but time is always of the essence. We could exchange emails back and forth and hopefully have a phone conversation if we click. I hope you have a wonderful day!

Considerably attractive, naturally feminine lady. Highly skilled professional. In my leisure, I would love to have someone refreshing to do things with- concerts, movies, walks, road trips...dining in & out... and more.
I appreciate someone with a good head on their shoulders, a good heart and soul, responsible, unattached, dependable and a committed friend. I require honesty. .. good communication too. I require someone healthy, clean, thin - average figure. I wish to spend time with someone that, even if I'm not intimate with them; I think about being that way...so I desire a pretty, fit, attractive individual to be around.

Seeking a mature, secure friend (preferably mid 30s ---early 40s.) Enrich my life. I have time on my hands to get to know someone of quality. I seek to hang out, and see what may develop from just talking and being in each other's presence. I desire this to be a one on one experience. 
Safe... something to always look forward to.

I'm thinking instead of heading downtown and meeting random girls at bars or a danceclub and buying them drinks. Maybe you are nice girl and you're thinking the same thing so why not go together and I'll buy you drinks and have a good time. Let me know, I'm open to suggestions.

It's been really hard for me to make friends so I decided to post this on CL and try my luck. I'm African American,straight, 5'5, slim. 
I'm very open minded and I enjoy traveling and going out to do fun things(shopping,movies,go karting,etc). Not big on clubbing and I don't smoke (don't mind if you do). I'm a bit shy at first, enjoy holding deep conversations and I'm a college student.
I don't mind any race, religion etc as long as you're genuinely open minded and understanding. I prefer 20-24 yo, someone who actually loves travelling once in a while and it will be better if you live nearby (Greenbelt, hyattsville, Beltsville, Laurel, Silverspring). So if you are also looking for a best friend that you can text a lot with, hang out often with and share memories together... Send an email and tell me about yourself. Please be a able to verify you're real via snapchat, FaceTime or any other video chat :-)

Hi

I want to go check out a movie tonight or this weekend. Now I am recently single and looking to stay that way, but I do need to replace my ""movie buddy"" if you will. So anyone interested in maybe getting a couple of drinks or a quick bite so we can chat a bit and feel each other out before catching a movie well, I'd love to hear from you...I've been looking forward to this sequel since I loved the first one, nothing like a good old dose of an 80's throwback action movie. All you need is an improbable plot, tons of action, plenty of gore and just add water and you got a good time, just leave your brain at home. Now chances are that this might be epically bad, but I'm willing to risk it if you are. 

I obviously posted this in the strictly platonic section, but I will be honest that I am big flirt and would like to categorize this as strictly-ish, since I'm open to whatever may happen. I'm 32, of mixed race, brown skin, love to just hang and have a good time. I would like to find someone who is fun, a great conversationalist and who is pretty open minded and might want to make this a regular thing. Race doesn't matter and please, no older than 36.

Anyone up for meeting up for a couple of drinks and some conversation. I'm truly not searching for sex or a date or any of that. Just got out of a long relationship and to be honest it's about the last thing I need. But do miss just having a fun attractive woman to talk to and just have a good time with. Maybe this is could be the start of a regular thing..Happy Hours, random outings etc etc. I'm 32, of mixed race, pretty laid back, well traveled, educated, and would like to meet someone who fits some of those same qualities. Oh it wouldn't hurt if you are smoking hot either, but that's just an aesthetic thing, deep down just be fun, light hearted, understanding, and please don't be one of those women who will unknowingly spend 2 hours informing me of all the drama in her life and then tell me that I'm such a great friend and it was great talking to me. I mean I am a great listener and I am very empathetic to what anyone may be going through, but PLEASE I want to go out to have some fun and so should you, I don't want to be your therapist and I don't need you to be mine. If we can adhere to that then we should get along great. Oh and please be able to talk about more than just pop culture....

Anyone else out there feeling troubled, lonely, or alone? Maybe we can talk and meet, and can help each other through this. I could use a close friend, and I'm open to more if anything develops, but it isn't necessary unless it works for both of us.

I have lost touch with most of my relatives, or in some cases, they have passed away. Most of my closer friends have moved away, or are at previous workplaces or part of activities that I no longer participate.

I have met a few people on CL or at various places throughout the DMV, but no real friendships or relationships have materialized. I've been surprised that so many people have hidden agendas. It has been disappointing.

I'm open to meeting anyone and your personal situation doesn't matter, as long as you are really looking to meet and spend time with a potential good friend, boyfriend, and/or lover in me. I'm not looking for an extended email exchange, so the sooner we can meet, the better. Let's work through this and build something special together. Your age, race, religion, etc. doesn't matter either.....I relate well to all and am very flexible and open minded. I only ask that you are serious about trying this, and are clean and DDF.

I'm really looking forward to hearing from you. Please introduce yourself a little when you reply, and put your favorite movie in the title to help me eliminate the SPAM. I don't need to see your pic because I care more about who you are rather than what you look like; however, if you want me to send you a pic, I expect you to send me yours first. 

Thanks.

Hello there!

Do you want to meet someone who is good natured, funny, sometimes argumentive, sarcastic, bold, honest, open, nonjudgemental, intelligent, hispanic, present, and helpful?
All those adjectives describe me. I'm not important; just a man who loves being a guy, who does many cool things, who won't bring you down, who understands your divinity. I post on here becuase I'm not actively seeking a girlfriend or wife. Maybe someone who thinks they are cool and wouldn't mind sharing that omnipresent love with each other and I'm not talking about sex. Time moves so fast but time shared with a good woman is to me beautiful and we'll worth the trouble. 
A friend first who likes to try, smell, see, feel, and experience the world. 
If you want, reply to this ad. I am real, if you are as well, ask for a pic or my number. Whatever makes you more comfortable as CL runs the gamut in what the world can offer.

It just hit me today that after living in Takoma for 2.5 years, I still have zero friends in the area (the realization came when I saw an attractive guy waiting to cross the street next to me, and I was like ""damn, why don't I know anyone around here?"") . Most of my friends live in DC proper, and that's where I do all of my socializing. However, I do love so many spots around Takoma and TKPK, and it would be great if on some weeknights or Sundays, when I'm too lazy to make the commute on the red line, I had someone with whom I could grab drinks at Republic, or food at Mark's Kitchen, Busboys, Evolve, etc. 

I'm pretty fun and easygoing, love art, animals, cinema, and languages. It'd be awesome to meet someone with similar interests within a walking distance from me. I'm mostly looking for friends, of any gender and sexual orientation, but cute local single guys looking for something more won't be turned away either (no dick pics though!).

Do we just follow the directions or create it?
I've seen and done much in fifty-one years but still have the drive to make a better life for the future. Will you be the drop in the pond sending waves rushing to the shore?

When our own lives are so brief yet filled with passion, curiosity, humility and joy.
We build our universe with family, friends, work, play and the one loved most of all.

Why is it so hard to chat with a real person. They chat a few days and the convo is awesome, then boom they disappear. Or better yet they ask for a pic and you send it and then I ask for one and they say their phone is broke or they don't have one. I call total bull shit.

I am athletic and somewhat handsome to some but everyone has their opinions so please be at least okay looking? lol.. not trying to be shallow but friendship has to have some kind of attraction to the eyes.

I recently lost touch with two of my best friends which are females b/c they moved to another state. Just trying to find that friendly connection where I can build that type of friendship again.

**Hello, 
My name is Ryan. This note, this message to you is written from a new juncture in my life, a juncture that requires that I require more of myself. It is not lost on me, the understanding that working, whether it is for oneself or as part of an organization, what is most commonly referred to as ""work"" is a requirement to sustain life and flourish in this societal structure. My point of focus in this commentary is the feeling of not wanting to be just another member of the ""rat-race"" for the sake of working alone, especially when that work calls into question my integrity or moral compass. I am of the opinion that there should be meaning and the ability to make a measurable positive impact, a real contribution. The scale is not as significant as being able to look back at the end of a day, at the end of a week and at the end of my tenure and say and feel that I have been a part of a great team and great organization and we have had a positive impact. My interaction, my contribution, my energy and effort left someone or some organization better off than when we started. I also yearn for an organization that has a track record of merit based forward progression in terms of increased responsibility, diversity of opportunity and upward mobility within the organization. An organization that breeds into the environment a culture and understanding that says that an individuals' energy, resources and creative intellectual property will be recognized and acknowledged with compensation that is commensurate to their contribution to the organization there by providing access to a level of personal security that will allow me to remove all distraction and put my entire self into the task at hand. I would like to and it is my hope that I will find this amalgamation of energy out there in an organization. 

If you are the organization I describe here, it would be an honor to speak with you. Please contact me directly. 

If you have any positive feedback, advice, ideas and resources that would point me in the right direction, please contact me direct. 

For those in tune with and aware of the ""alternative"", a few facts... I am currently 32 as of this January 19. On the Zodiac spectrum, I am Capricorn Decan 3. On the Chinese Zodiacal spectrum, I am year of the Rat. On the Numerological spectrum, I am Life Path Six. One more for the road, my blood type is AB+.

I am also a still photographer using my own professional equipment (ig: @lifeisaphoto19, fb: photography by ryan r gilbert). I am available to shoot on-location or I have the option of a small in-home studio with available backdrops, lighting and camera/tripod combo to acheive a high quality finish. I welcome any ideas for personal photography projects (modeling and on-location corporate head shots, complete model portfolio sessions, tattoo photography, artistic b/w boudoir, adult entertainment promo photography, pet photography, legacy photography and much more), event photography and any other generally positive opportunities including drum circles and full moon gatherings.

**I posted what is seemingly (and it is) a job posting ad, in the personals section because I would like to use it to draw like minded and like energy individuals to myself. I have been in the DMV area now about a month and I would love to meet some cool people to replace crew back in Miami. Im open to text email or talk and eventually meet some kindreds out there.

I've been waiting for a special woman who wants to have an illicit affair in my NW Washington DC office. One who will let her desires lead the way. I keep imagining her walking into my office, closing the door, we kiss and I begin to caress her wanting body. I know I will enjoy her soft breasts and can't wait to feel her nipples tighten with gentle nibbles. My only intention is to touch her in ways that are stimulating and pleasing to her. Of course when she feels my mouth, tongue and hands teasing and enjoying her nipples her hand will take mine and will slip it between her burning thighs. I can feel my kisses moving lower until I am able to tease pleasure from her with my tongue. My one desire is to fulfil her desires and hear her moans of pleasure. My pleasure is her pleasure and is all I'll receive in return for my efforts. After she reaches her orgasm I'll help her dress and soothe her trembling body with soft kisses and touches and whisper how beautiful she is as she sets out to begin the rest of her day. No one but she and I will ever know why she smiles.

This is a real advert, today is Thursday and very very cold outside!

Im looking for others who understand the thrill and obsession about cheating and not getting caught!

Im married and yes it is horrible that I cheat but I'm starting to think its a weird fetish or thrill aspect of my life. For the most part, its not even about the sexual act itself but the planning of it and meeting a stranger in a planned place and the anticipation of touching that stranger for a brief moment knowing she is also cheating and having to ""hurry up"" before the phone calls come again.

The thrill of meeting in a public place and acting like a real couple - kissing, hand holding etc Nothing to wild in public, the point is nobody else knows that we are not a real couple. For me, it has now crossed over into an addiction where I enjoy seeing other married women for a brief moment, not even having sex most of the time---just passionate kissing, grouping and maybe petting/rubbing and then we both go our separate ways . . . .

How is for you ladies out there who have done this also? Is it more of a thrill or addiction for you as well?

Thanks for listening and NOT judging

Good evening ladies,

I'll try to keep this light. I'm 9 years deep into an unfulfilled marriage. We southerners married young, thinking our flaming hot desire would be all we needed to weather life. But when is that deep, understanding love supposed to set in? The passion has cooled, but I'm still a passionate man.

We're not separating. We have roots together, and beyond the chemistry we understand each other. I know my life is better with her than on my own. I'm missing something, though; there is a disconnect. 

I'm looking for a sympathetic ear. Some one who can listen without already knowing the answer. My ideal is that we can help each other. I can show you what the man sees and thinks, and you help me with her. If you're a super-hero relationship guru, I'll take that, too. But I'd like to connect with someone who has been there or is also in this funk.

I'm cool with this going online, or in person. Text is good for organizing thoughts, in person gives rich non-verbal cues. Tell me how you like it.

About me: I'm 30 years old, masters in engineering, new to NOVA. (I hope I'm using that right.) Conservative family, but very social and accepting. I find stress relief through exercise, but I'm certainly not a marathon runner, muscleman, or ninja. 

Thank you and goodnight!

I'm a semi-literate ass-clown who believes that making offensive remarks about women will make them like me. I also hold the belief that posting pictures of my genitalia in free ads on CL will result in a sexual encounter with an attractive woman. And while nothing has happened yet to suggest that my beliefs are accurate, I will continue making offensive remarks and posting pictures online. My energy, like my ignorance, is boundless.

Bullying appears popular nowadays so I may graft bullying on to my patchwork personae. Maybe a the rejection of science and an embrace of literal interpretations of ancient literature may have places too.

Now I must be on my way. I have to get back to typing one misspelled word replies to ads I believe have been posted online by attractive women.

I am a credit to manhood.

She was involved in a automobile accident a few months ago, and has since been stuck in the house. She has expressed to me she misses having some to talk to. (She recently also cut off many ""friends"" because she simply out grew them). So what I'm looking for is a chill laid back female, who is willing to talk with and hangout with from time to time. I do work a shift where I'm away most of the day, so preferably a house wife or someone home during the day is best. So send me a quick blurb as to why you would be an awesome friend to her.

Haven't been out in a while and looking to go to a lounge Friday night or Saturday and have drinks. Preferably in the VA area not trying to drive to far or we can meet up and uber somewhere. 

This doesn't have to be a one time hang out, i'm also interested in meeting new friends as well to hang out with and do things. I enjoy events/comedy shows, lounges, happy hours, movies, dinners, spa day, shopping, im really pretty open. I'm single and my work schedule allows me the leisure to make my own schedule.

Trying to meet someone on CL has become like finding a needle in a haystack. It shouldn't be so difficult.

I think I have many of the traits that women look for here. I'm honest and sincere; passionate, loving, and caring; kind, friendly, and loyal; independent, intelligent, and attractive; a non-smoker, very light drinker, and D/D free; with a good sense of humor. That all sounds good, right???

However, when I respond to ads, I often get lost in the mass replies that ladies receive. Sometimes, I resend my replies a few days later asking if there is any interest, and I hear that they never saw my first reply.

So many people are scared. Many others are playing games. Add in the lies, deceptions, SPAM, and SCAMs, and it is so hard today to make a connection.....like trying to find a needle in a haystack.

If you are my needle I would love to find you. I want to find a lady that is looking for friendship, someone to do activities with, enjoys the outdoors, likes to cuddle, and would like a little romance when the time is right. Someone that can enjoy the moment, and doesn't have an agenda or is looking for someone to take care of them. Someone that is able to take it as it goes, has faith in us to build a friendship and/or a relationship, without self-imposed pressures.

Tell me a little about yourself so we can get started. Any age, race, religion, personal situation, etc. is welcome to reply. None of it matters to form a friendship, and we'll see where it goes from there. I don't need to see your pic because I care more about who you are rather than what you look like; however, if you want me to send you a pic, I expect you to send me yours first. Please put your favorite dessert in the subject line. If we meet someplace that has it on the menu, I'll buy you a serving of it. Thanks!

Please don't reply if you aren't real or serious, or want to exchange endless emails. I'm very serious about meeting to get to know you in person, and I want nothing to do with joining websites or paying for memberships.

Since it's awkward to actually ask random girls (without getting slapped!) I figured I'd try asking here instead.

I am separated from my wife with NO possibility of reconciliation. I have a 20 year step son away in college and a 10 year old daughter who I love dearly. I should be getting a divorce later this year.

I work from home in software development and since I work from home do not have a lot of direct contact with ladies during the day and that is why I have posted this ad on Craigslist.

I am smart, honest and hardworking although I am a little shy.

I am white although your race is not important to me.

I'm an early 50's caucasian business professional going to be in your part of the country for my very first time in the next couple of weeks. While my days are filled with meetings, my evenings are filled with .... nothing! Not that I can't find a little mischief to get into by myself, but enjoying a nice dinner, possibly sharing a bottle of fine wine, and maybe some great conservation with a beautiful woman like yourself sounds much more enjoyable to me. I'm 6' 00"", 200 lbs. clean, respectful, and know how to treat a lady.

I'm a blue collar guy that works in a white collar world. I'm confident but certainly not arrogant. I have a great sense of humor and love the opportunity to get to know you just a bit before I head your way. 

Please introduce yourself and give me a couple of ideas to pique my interest! 

Have a great day!
Mike

58 year old male professional ready to escort you to parties, ceremonies, reunions, dinners, theater, amusement parks, museums, dances, or just a special night out. Also available for longer trips or cruises (I am a platinum member on certain cruise lines with preferential treatment). I have available a car, motorcycle, boat or tandem bicycle for a private tour around town. I have a large collection of formal wear for those formal functions (able to match all colors with vests/cummerbunds), over 100 suits, casual wear, to swim wear depending on the function. I am a perfect gentleman well versed in etiquettes with a professional education/background. I love to dance (both ballroom and modern) and am willing to try anything (as long as it is legal). This IS NOT a sex service: it is a professional escort service for professionals. A valid ID and deposit will be required to create an appointment.

Just finished a session with my therapist and I don't think it is helping. She suggests I just take a break and concentrate on working on some minor personal issues I have that I tend to overlook. What I really need is friend that can be attached or unattached to talk to and have lunches, happy hours, or dinners. My ideal match would be someone that is liberal, outgoing, uninhibited, engaging, pride in their health and appearance and just plain fun. Is this you?

Hi, AA woman in search of meeting new people to network and hangout. 

I enjoy a variety of activities such as happy hours, hookah lounges, art galleries, travel, sporting events, working out and defintely open to new things.

If you're looking for the same, let's connect!

Maybe this is a weird thing to look for but I'm hoping to find someone that would be interested in being a pseudo personal trainer - you'd workout with me some (and pick the workout) and other times assign me workouts and fitness related activities. You'll discourage me from slacking or procrastinating on workouts by assigning extra if I do or figuring out other consequences if I do. 

You: Female (I find I work better with female trainers and I also find women tend to be better at creating structure), very physically fit and athletic yourself (maybe you played a varsity sport, maybe you are into crossfit or triathlons or just generally being a badass). You have some interest in fitness, health and diet and enjoy pushing someone. 

Me: healthy, hwp, fit 30 year old man looking to take it to a whole new level. I currently workout about 3-4 times a week but have mediocre eating habits and lack consistency on both exercise and diet. 

If you are into fitness and like the idea of training someone and getting paid while you workout, you should write me.
