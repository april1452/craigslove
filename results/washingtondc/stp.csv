Good mornin on this rainy ugly Monday. So were on craigslist browsing I see if your reason my ad. I wanted to talk and find someone that I can maybe have conversation and a little discrete friendship with.

So me, I'm married and been married a long time.. I love my life and everything about it, but sometimes after being with someone so long you feel like your missing out or just longing for attention. I have no desire to change either of our marital statuses. All I want is to find someone similar to myself and that being, normal everyday person dedicated to their family and no one in the world would suspect us to be on CL, you would need to be married and have a family and enough to lose that discretion is extremely important. You need to desire attention, and that warm feeling again when someone makes you feel hAppy.. This is a no pressure thing meaning let's just start as chat and go from there wherever it takes us.. I am 32 so I prefer a married women between 25- 45. I'm available to have email chats all day so it be nice if you had time during the day as we'll, since evenings aren't gonna work we'll.. So if you read my add and interested shoot me a email as if love I hear from you and see where it goes. Stay dry stay safe and hope to talk soon!!

If you are down with the private investigation please hit me up. I would prefer if you were in the area of DC or pg county and between 19-26 that helps. So I basically just need to see whats hes been doing on social media that I'm blocked from, and I don't want to make a fake page because that's way to obvious. 

My preference is for someone that can let me have access to your page... Which is why I would prefer if you have a fake page.

Ok so no judging, if this isn't the thing for you please keep it moving. Also I don't welcome bashing emails about my approach to the situation. .... my my PI assistant.. thanks in advance!!

I find myself feeling somewhat restless, and looking for sustained connections online. My goal in doing this isn't to engage in a torrid physical affair but rather to find steady electronic interaction (mainly via email) with someone who stimulates me intellectually, emotionally, and physically.

I'm seeking someone in the 32-40 age range. Also, I'd prefer if she was reasonably well educated and engaged in professional careers. (No, I won't be expecting to see a resume, but there will be more common ground with someone in a white collar occupation.) I'm a fit, active person, and I'd prefer someone who is similarly inclined (runner, yogi practitioner, etc.), or at least fits into the ""HWP"" category. There are some other characteristics that I value, but they seem rather generic and subjective: sense of humor, literacy, taste in music, books, wine, etc. 

Finally, I won't try to meet you in person, nor will I inflict unsolicited pictures of my genitalia on you. I'll just be a regular, nice guy.

Bored? Looking for some excitement a few weekends this summer? I'm looking for an open-minded, drug-free travel companion this summer. I have a couple trips to North Carolina, Pennsylvania and maybe even South Carolina coming up soon and would like to not do it alone. These trips are car club related so expect lots of cruising, picture taking and car talk with fellow enthusiasts. Generally, these trips are Thursday thru Sunday but vary. SC may be 9-10 days.

You should be late 20s to late 40s, on the shorter side (think 5'4"" and below), HW proportional (No BBW sorry), attractive but not looking for a model, non smoker would be preferred and willing to play the part of my girlfriend as required in public settings. This would include some kissing and touching to be believable.

This is not an advertisement for sex. I'm not paying you with money but you get the thrill of travel, all your food and drinks covered and I'm fine with buying you clothing to make you look good. Basically, you get a sugar daddy for a weekend without having to have sex with me. 

Me: 42, short, bearded and bald, not a big, fat guy but I need to start running again. I drink, absolutely no drugs, non smoker and white.

Hey Guys! I am a 28 year old gay guy who is looking for a genuine friends. Not really into clubs and bars so making friends in this town can be difficult- would be open to trying a couple out if I had some cool people to go out with. I enjoy gchatting at work, texting, and emailing. Have to speed the day along some how!I love traveling, camping, going to the beach, movies, and cooking. Ideally we would hang out and stuff but can start out with email and texting. 

I am a Maryland native and own my own business. I really like Art- visual and performing. Super cliche I know, but I'm very into Musical Theater. I love being outside- hiking, camping, and exploring historical places. Down for weekend trips- anything from NYC to Williamsburg to Philly. I try to travel as much as possible. I am looking for someone who is honest, down to earth, and not a closet case trying to score a hookup. 

You don't have to be gay! I have many straight buddies. Looking for friends who are interested in hanging out in person as well! I'm smoke and drug free (occasional 420) if that matters. 

Hit me up if you want to get to know me!! Nothing planned this weekend - let's change that :)

Hello, I am a 32 year old guy living in Pentagon City who works in the Crystal City area. I am looking for a work out partner where we can motivate each other to go to the gym.

We could go to classes together, do some basic training together, or show up & go our separate ways. I am not a member of any gym yet but I am considering LA Fitness, Sport & Health, & possibly Golds Gym. I work 9-5ish & am able to go either before work or after & if Sport & Health is the choice, I'd consider going at lunch too. 

I am open to a man, woman or group of people if I get multiple responses. Please note this is strictly platonic.

It's almost 9pm on a Saturday night and there's nothing to do. Most of the other twenty-somethings and thirty-somethings are going out to the bars and clubs. You could go too; perhaps your friends have invited you to go out with them; but it's really not your thing. What you wish most of all was that the library was open. A really nice library, with cozy chairs, hardwood floors, area rugs, and real wooden bookshelves. But at this time of night, all of the libraries are closed and locked. Apparently nobody likes to read a Saturday night.

Still, you like to fantasize. You like to imagine yourself walking through the aisles, pausing ever so briefly each time one of your familiar favorites catches your eye: Austen, Bronte, Dickens, Dickinson, Faulkner, Hemingway, Hugo, Joyce. . . Just seeing the names brings a smile to your face as you recall the pleasures that their words have given you over the years. You've already read almost everything by the great ones, but there is always something more. Another treat to savor. Those last few Shakespeare plays you've never read. Or one of Vladimir Nabokov's more obscure novels from his Russian period. Or Finnegans Wake. No, not Finnegans Wake. You need something that will satisfy tonight, not next year. How about an Emily Dickinson poem? Yes.

You pull a book off the shelf, open to a random page, and continue slowly walking down the aisle as you read the words

Master--open
your life wide, and
take me in forever,
I will never be tired--
I will never be noisy
when you want to be
still--I will be
your best little
girl--

Suddenly, not looking where you are going, you walk right smack into a man. A tall man in a corduroy blazer and dark rimmed glasses. A man who is probably at least ten years older than you, if not more. A man who is surprisingly fit and attractive in a college professor sort of way. Where did he come from? This is your library. Your dream. Your imagination. You thought you were alone. Embarrassed and flustered, you apologize and quickly turn around to head in the other direction.

""The library is closed. What are you doing here? How did you get in here?"" His voice is deep and smooth. Strong. And as he speaks, he places a firm hand on your shoulder.

""What are you reading?"" he asks as he steps closer and places his other hand on your other shoulder. You wonder what kind of dream this is. You can feel his eyes as they read the words on the page

nobody else will see me, but you--
but that is enough--
I shall not want any more--

His big hands begin to slide down your arms, and you can feel your breath quickening. You notice a simple gold band on his finger, and your eyes fixate on it as he takes the book from you, closes it, and places it on the shelf.

You turn around to face him, and you raise your head until the two of you are looking directly into each other's eyes. An academic man and a young scholar. A common love for literature. A quiet place to share each other's interests.

Perhaps we should continue the discussion in a real library?

The big question is what's your number and at what number does it start being kinda gross if ever?

I asked this particular question because recently my buddy went out on a date with a chick who has been with 14 guys, she confessed that she didn't like to use condoms and my buddy didn't see her again. Answer the questions if you wish and leave any comment you might have on the issue.

I am a 36 years old, 6t tall, 205lb, great shape and muscular. Very down to earth and humble Latin guy. I am looking for someone who is interested in having a workout Partner and a hanging out buddy. I like long bike rides and long walks.I usually workout 4 to 5 times a week and belong to WSC. I am open to workout either in the very early morning or in the evening after 6pm. You can be straight or gay as long as you are very masculine. Be ready and serious about working out. I prefer to work out with someone who is already in shape and know his way around the gym since I am not looking to train anyone. If you are serious please reply back to this posting and tell me about yourself. Please note that I am not a body body builder nor I want to be one. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Hey hey hey! 

Im looking for my new bestie. Someone as fun, outgoing, loyal, and mature as me! Some one I can call and do things like out to eat, bars, go karts, bowling, etc. I dont really club alot. Also Im trying to get my body in shape so maybe we can do things like pole dancing or zumba, and grab a cinnabon after lol. I just want a cool chill friend who needs a bestie as bad as I do and we can create a long lasting bond. 

Now it doesnt matter if you bi or les, im bicurious myself. (So maybe we can be discreet fwb on a drunk night lol) Mainly I just want a friend where we can talk everyday and whos serious. I met people on here before but had no luck. They either was just pic collectors or inconsistent. I dont have no more time to waste. I especially need to find a friend before my 25th birthday when I take a trip to Vegas lol. 

Im really easy to get a long with and have a great personality so hit me up if you feel we connect or even if you dont feel so we can try. I get along with everybody. Even if you just need a friend to vent to im your girl. I love helping people. Im a great friend to have :) I lost my other friends because we grew apart or from their betrayal. But ne who, just reply and tell me a little bout yourself and attach a pic :) 

I give why to much into my friendships and never get the same in return. So if your just looking to email back and or disappear after one day dont bother! 

No doms. No men. No couples. Please be ddd free. Please be between ages 23-28. Looking forward to meeting my new bestie :) 

P.s I know cl is a weird place to make friends but hey Ill try anything once lol ttys fingers crossed :)

Can a male and female be just friends?

Yes and No. If either one of them is single, than game over. 

I can speak from personal experience, specially if the guy is single.

You have probably heard that all guys are monsters, but its not true. Not if he is in a relationship or married etc or has a kid .. yati yati .. you get the picture.

so until he has other things preoccupying his mind, yes maybe they are monsters? but only looking to be tamed by the right female.

I happen to be one of the tamed males, who has or I should say HAD several female friends but as soon as I locked onto one of them and went all the way with the bells and whistles (starting a family etc).. no more female friends are around ..

why?

probably because I dont have any time to spend with them...

So now that Its just me and my family .. I long for other human contact .. because you can only go without outside contact for just so long..

so I am hearing posting on the friend section of CL, I normally post things for $ale etc.

But I want to find a genuine person, who really wants to be a friend.

I am not a monster, I hope you are not either.

Thank you for taking the time to read my ad. I'm a curvy, size 14 jeans, 39 year young female looking for a gentleman that I can hang out with...gay or straight. Race does not matter, however, I do prefer white men. Some possible scenarios are going to the movies, going for walks, to lunch/dinner, the gym, or simply staying home and watching TV or play video games. I'm easy going but tend to get along better with men than women. 

I am truly seeking a platonic relationship...not intimate. I'm simply looking for a cool guy that enjoys the company of an intelligent and attractive African American woman. Why a preferably a single male? Because a single man has more free time...because I have no intention of sneaking around...and most importantly, I do not want to cause any problems for anyone. 

Please respond with your favorite TV show or movie in the subject line. If you send me your picture (do not send me anything inappropriate), I'll send you mine. 

Please, if you are not serious in seeking a platonic friendship, I ask that you do not respond to this ad!

Non-smokers, no drugs. I don't drink, but I don't mind at all if you do. :)

Do you wish there was an older man in the local area with whom you could confide and share your ideas, questions, goals, successes, disappointments, and fantasies? Are you intrigued by the idea of having a completely open-minded father figure who will listen without criticizing or judging? Do you long for someone experienced and assertive with whom you can safely explore your submissive personality in a caring, nurturing way?

I am a local college instructor in my mid forties who would like to pursue with a younger woman a relationship that is more meaningful and less transient than the professional relationships I have with my students. You could be a college student or a college-educated young professional. In order for this to work, you would need to be somewhere in the DC metro area and willing to meet in person. This would be our secret, so I don't mind if you are already in a relationship (as long as you don't mind the same about me). If this sounds interesting, let's meet for a walk or a cup of coffee so we can see whether we have the right chemistry.

Really?!? You clicked on it that quickly. I warned you to open slowly ;) But hello there! Thanks for stopping by and reading...though are you really looking or just here snickering at all the ads? I know...I'd snicker too ;) Or maybe you have an amazing laugh. In any case, I'm a geek in need of a friend. I honestly don't have very many friends and certainly don't have many that I can freely talk to on a regular basis. Now for the tough sell...I'm an older geek, 37 years old, married with a kid; I play video games, love sci-fi movies/tv shows...movies in general are awesome...I even like rom-coms...hey, bearded men do cry ;) I love to read and will try just about anything especially if it's recommended. I like to say I enjoy writing but I honestly don't write much but if I do, it's on the horror side. I'm not religious by any stretch of the imagination...though my imagination runs pretty wild and deep...so ghost stories, hauntings, mediums, life after death and other topics along those lines fascinate me. 

Am I unhappy...no. Am I lonely...yes; though sometimes it's self-inflicted. I'm quiet and shy; a bit hard to read; always thinking; a tad stubborn. I'd love to have a friend with similar interests. Age really isn't a concern and neither is marital status...but if you're married with or without kids, I'm sure we'd have a range of discussion topics. Thanks for reading!

Warm weather is here and the parks are calling. And as the park ranger advises, it is best to always hike with a partner when venturing far, but that is easier said than done as people in my age group have grown sedentary. Ideally you are a woman, man or a couple, older than 50 years old, in shape and with time in your hands and the desire to enjoy nature. I'd prefer married people as I am but that's not a deal breaker. I am a moderate hiker.

hello all, 

I like to make some more good friends; 
It is hard to find honest and trustworthy people you can depend on 
life would be so much better and easier when you have good friends you can trust and depend on 

Looking for all types of people who are: cool, smart, intelligent, honest, dependable, geeks, dorks, shy, quiet, uncool 
I'm looking for good, honest, trustworthy people 

Please reply with a photo(at least 1 photo would be nice, but the more the better), and some comments, description, resume, etc about yourself(the more the better); also tell me what you are looking for and why you responded 

This group of people I make friends with can tackle lifes problems; you need good friends and family to be successful; family is a given; friends you can make and change; so I hope you take a chance to change your life for the better and maybe the following will come true: 
- more money; better financial condition 
- sucess in life 
- more good friends; be happier; have people that you can depend on and also you will reciprocate the help 
- advice on anything 
- etc; I will try to think of more when I repost 

if I get a lot of responses, it may take a while to respond so feel free to send another response 
I'm not looking to pay for sex or porn or webcams so please don't waste my time if that is what you want 

thanks for reading, 
hope to make a friend

And so, with all of the divisive talk about race and ethnicity in this years political debate, and a video that I saw on Facebook, I had an Ephipany. 

I don't have any people who are Caucasian, Hispanic, or other than African American that I would consider true friends. To be clear, we may work together or smile and walk by one another on the street. 
How can this be in one of the most multi-cultural cities in the world? 
And so, the only way for this deficit in my life to change is for me to aggressively try to diversify my friendships. This is a strictly platonic request. I love discussing politics (we can agree to disagree if necessary), hearing about the international travel of others, grabbing a beer or glass of wine, supporting the nonprofit community, going out dancing, listening to live music, trying new restaurants on H street and the Navy Yard (I'm open to other areas), and. hitting a few golf balls on the range (although I'm a novice). I'm a non-practicing Catholic from the Midwest. I'm pretty well educated (Masters) and I believe that laughter is central to getting through life. 

I don't know if we have anything in common, but I'd welcome the opportunity to meet with you on an upcoming sunny 70 degree day and discuss it. 

Hmm...have you asked yourself.. Do you welcome diversity in your life?

Good morning and I hope you are doing well. I am finally at the point in which I want to meet a woman in a similar situation. I am a MWM that is frustrated with my marriage. I have been through the counseling all all others avenues one would take. However, its not easy. What I am seeking (that's why I am in this section) is a woman in a similar situation and has the desire to have a friend. I am succesful in both my professional and personal life. I guess what it boils down to I the need for conversation, once we build trust and maybe, just maybe a little innocent flirting. I am open to the ages of 28 but no older than me 45. We need to have something in common. I am fit, handsome and respect my body and do not abuse it with drugs or smoking. I know its hard to look forward but in reality spring is right around the corner. Although this is a friendship discretion is a must! I am also open to a single woman that can relate or has been in this situation. Or simply a woman that wants to have some fun and make a new friend.

I originally posted this a few weeks ago but after some crazy replies I removed it. However, here I am again with hopes that I may find what I am looking for. Have an amazing day and I know you are out there!

Hello all, 

Quick stats: 31/m, Brown Hair, Blue Eyes (Glasses), 5'5"", and on the chubby end for mammals. 

Quick story: 18 year old kid knew everything there was to know. Couldn't be bothered to listen to anyone because he had grown up earlier than most (and sadly that's the truth), so naturally, he married the first woman he had sex with because he was a ""good Christian"" and astoundingly stupid. 

Flash forward six years. After working nonstop, dropping out of his Senior year at college, and divorce on the horizon (he was a terrible husband, but she should have kept taking the anti-depressants, it might have helped), a new chapter opened up. 

Lost a lot of weight. Then lost his job because in 2011, no one needed another ""Best Buy"" knockoff store in Colorado. Moved to Texas and then met another woman. Kind, responsible, and really good for this man. 

Unfortunately, in 2013, a brain tumor shredded the marriage. He had life saving surgery, but became epileptic (not a big deal), but the couple were never as close again as the stress of paying for neurosurgery, her Master's Degree, and his recovery was just too much to bear. 

They are still together and they are fast friends who do a lot together, but the romance is gone and the man is on what he calls ""autopilot"". And their problems aren't related to talking. They almost over share. Both know how the other fills, but romantically: round peg, square hole. 

So, here we are. She's finishing her degree, loving her job in DC, he put back on a lot of the weight (not all of it) and goes to therapy.

Surprise, the man is me! 

I'm looking for friends. I've always gotten along with women more. Not exactly looking romantically, but is not going to stop if it's right (which is horrible, but attempting to be completely honest). I have lots of interesting thoughts, discussions, love funny people, want to go out and dance, will watch a movie in the theater every single weekend and enjoy football as well as comic books. Also love kids and dogs. Have two dogs myself. Sadly no kids and it's a tough call if my other half wants that. 

Want to talk? Grab coffee? Write a screenplay together? Watch the sunrise or set? Act crazy at a dance club we don't belong in? Or just watch movies in the theater or my place (I work from home)? 

Hope you are out there looking for the same. You never know, maybe two people are wishing on the same star. 

Alejandro

Sorry for that title. I can show myself out after I put this up. I am trying to find a woman to chat with. Everything seems to have gone the way of short messages through txt and we seem to be losing the element of conversation and jokes through email. I miss it. Being able to type out a long one and have you respond with one of your own. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to go back to the stone ages and actually hand write out letters...but I might hand write you a note and take a picture on my smartphone and send that instead.

Hopefully you aren't too tired from setting the clocks ahead. If so, you can wake up slowly with your coffee, read this and say, oh yeah, that's the guy to write back to. He gets it. He will read all my stuff without judgement and ask for more. The perfect man...one who actually listens and wants to communicate. 

There are few fine print lines. Of course there are. I am tall. Blue eyes. A few bumps and bruises from a long career in the military and playing sports and other competitions. Salt pepper hair. Married.

Life is pretty much a solitary affair for me but I try to keep busy. I am happy with my hobbies and the friends that I do have, but looking for more friends and the opportunity for personal growth. My hobbies are important to me and include stamp and coin collecting and being an avid reader of non-fiction. I am currently reading ""The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World"" by Andrea Wulf. I especially enjoy reading biographies and the last biography that I read was ""Jung"" by Deirdre Bar. If you are in your 50s or 60s and are looking for a friend I would like to meet you. Please live in the DC METRO area.

Not sure if it's the weather or the water but I seem to getting very aroused of the thought of having another women and I'm not talking about a MILF or some toned gym rat but a normal women who lives a normal life that perhaps is missing some excitement and adventure. The thought of having a secret relationship with a women, who on the outside lives a wholesome cookie cutter life but behind closed doors she shares my secret. That we are lovers, that when time allows we meet even just to see each other and share a kiss, we email each other to stay in touch and when time and space allows, you let me have you. You can be married or single I'm fine with that just understand that I'm married and if you are to understand that I'm not looking to add drama or change your situation and in return you do the same.

I won't be posting any pictures for the obvious reasons but I can describe myself, 5'8, black hair, brown eyes, 180 lbs, short hair, facial hair at times and Afghan. I am dominant and I know what I want so if you are someone that keeps butting heads in life we won't get along.

You: Physically I don't have a requirement and I'm pretty open to race and age. However you have to be mentally normal. When I say normal no addictive/compulsive personality, don't be a creeper or a clinger.

Put ""Lover"" in the subject line so I know you are real

Hey everyone!

So...I've found myself in a situation where I've got way too many pairs of flip flops...way too many. I guess I've accumulated them over the years and now I'm stuck with a closet full. Some haven't even been worn!

Anyone else seem to have too many?
Do you wear them all?

I wear a men's size 9. If anyone (male or female) would be interested in having some or would simply like to talk about flip flops, what brands they like, etc...I am totally open! I am also willing to give them to a new home free of charge if you are friendly :)

Hope to hear from some laid back and cool people!

The only request just be sane, fun and open minded.

I'm seeking a female who is interested who wants to meet for ongoing massage session(s). It can be a one time thing or ongoing if we have chemistry. Again we can meet to discuss these things and get to know one another.

All I ask please be someone into a healthy lifestyle or into that. Meaning I don't mind if you are just getting into fitness or might be working on it which is typical. I don't expect perfect or someone who's always in the gym either. I am very fit and CLEAN I prefer the same. I exercise and always take pride in my body.


If you are feeling you want to experience an amazing magic hands massage to sooth some aches and pains I am great at focusing on pressure points too.

Please be OPEN MINDED and EASY GOING like myself. I just want to make it very straight forward I want to meet an open minded female who understands the power of massages.

I am seeking a counselor/coach type person -- female only -- and almost surely unlicensed, for discussion and dialog about relationships. But I seek a situation where you are comfortable with me being undressed, fully exposed, during our meetings and discussion. That's not allowed for licensed counselors/therapists, but unlicensed persons have more flexibility. I enjoy talking through my life issues with someone creative and empathic, and in particular am seeking relationship counseling. I am not seeking sex. But physical exposure and expression facilitates verbal revealing.

I have posted before, and have found someone very helpful to talk to, whom I do see on occasion. But I could benefit from additional dialog, and I'd prefer someone closer to home, which for me means Montgomery County. I'd prefer a location in or close to Montgomery County -- upper NW DC is okay, as is nearby PG county.

I am a single man, middle-aged. Apart from discussion about relationships and dating, you'll find that in such other conversation as naturally arises, I'm intelligent, curious, well-educated, thoughtful. I can be pretty funny at times.

I'd prefer contacts from counselors/coaches who are at least 30 or older, though a bit younger are welcome to make contact. But generally, more experience with life and dating, and closer to my experience, is likely to work better. In deep or personal conversations, I'm usually more at ease with white or Asian women (no disrespect to others, it's just my cultural base); but I am open to women of other ethnicities making contact and seeing where the mutual comfort level is. 

If you answer, please tell me about anything that you've done that's even kind of related -- former therapists and graduate students in counseling are encouraged to reply. But really any articulate, insightful, empathic woman may be right -- a businesswoman, an academic, military, also a massage therapist, nurses, female bartenders, or even an escort (but once again I am not seeking sex here, not intercourse or oral or any such thing here) -- someone with experience in listening to people on the job, may be right for this and for me.

Along with exploring relationship issues, this sort of experience is a chance for me to feel acceptance and companionship in the company of a woman. It's necessary that you be comfortable with a naked man, but also with possible arousal. I emphasize that there would be no sex, and that the conversation and dialog and coaching are a very real part of this, and very important to me. 

If interested, write to me and I can tell you more about what I'm seeking. I will offer reasonable hourly remuneration for your counseling, coaching and listening skills, and for the environment of acceptance you create. ($50/hour, possibly more, negotiable.) Please confirm your age and also confirm that you can host. 

If you're comfortable with it, you can provide a rough indication of where you are located. I would hope, if it works out, that this would be a once or twice a month type experience, ongoing for some time. I am really seeking someone in Montgomery County, MD.

I am not seeking a ""Domme."" A real counselor, even unlicensed, is still someone whom I pay, but who builds a genuine, personal connection, in the sense of really getting to know me and wanting to help me improve my life. If the connection works, a counselor/coach really develops a genuine concern for a client, and can, in a sense, celebrate with the client whatever progress the client makes in improving the quality of his life. I am seeking the kind of human bonding, support and connection that comes from a real counselor. If you are a Domme, either in private life or professionally, you'd probably be comfortable with all this, and I'd welcome hearing from you; but I am not seeking that side of your personality (nor your dungeon space).

Clearly of liberal stripe (already volunteering on the Sanders campaign). Lapsed Unitarian with buddhist leanings. I like riding around the DC and greater mid-atlantic/shenandoahs on my BMW adventure bike (See Ewan McGregor's ""Long Way Around,"" though I do tend to stay on pavement.

I have a flexible schedule and can usually make time throughout the day or evening with enough notice, and most of the Fairfax County indoor pools are convenient for me.

I also enjoy art and music (playing instruments) even though I'm a newbie at the guitar. I've played the piano and violin for a long time though. If you play an instrument that would be awesome! I'm an artist also but I haven't made anything in quite a while so if you are interested in that, that'd be cool. I can be pretty silly sometimes but I do enjoy fun people. I don't care about your gender, if you could just be in my age group that would be perfect. I haven't gone many places but I'd love to just go somewhere and hang out. I'm very open-minded to anything.

Hello, I'm an attractive, clean, professional white male who would like to find a female who likes to visit area casinos. Sometimes I may go during the week, but mostly it's a Friday or Saturday night. I will cover all room expenses and meals..... Of course I'm willing to meet first if you'd like. Any questions just ask. Thanks.

First of all that is NOT a hookup posting and NOT a sex thing. They say that a simple hug and even a cuddle can do wonders for people..I just miss having basic human contact..platonic contact. I'm a respectful person and always a gentleman and I can provide references upon request..lol. If I get any legitimate replies to my post I'll be surprised. 

But if someone genuine does reply that person and I can meet somewhere in public and meet first. We don't even have to cuddle that night...no pressure or rush..just go at whatever pace the other person sets.

Hello.
I'm a 22 year old woman who is a natural introvert and it honestly sucks as I'm getting older. I hate not being able to call someone if I want to see a movie or if I want to grab dinner. I'm fine with doing these things alone but as I get older I notice that my social life needs more. I'm a student at NVCC, studying criminal justice. I am seeking someone mature, cool and especially drama free. I don't care about your race or religion. Be around the same age. Just be a cool girl.

If chosen, YOU will be my first in this to fulfill my fantasy in double... It is important that all things fall into place and have a great time in the making :) ... You should be adventurous as we are looking for a third for preferably ongoing experiences...

About him... a lethal combination of tall, handsome, and sexy...
About her... a ginger with personality, beauty, and sexy to boot...

Both of us are Professional, very Good Looking, Athletic, DD Free, Non-smokers, Drinks Socially, and DO NOT Use/Do Drugs...

Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement... 
We expect to email, chat, exchange pics and speak on the phone prior to meeting... (photo and general information will be inquired to get to know you personally)...

SERIOUS INTEREST and INQUIRIES ONLY!!!... NO MALES... NO DRAMA....

Please note: Not looking to engage in convo that leads to a dead end, meaning that no progression is made so we can see were this might lead! Meeting socially to see if we have connection/chemistry with casual conversation, interaction and if we do we can go from there. If we do connect, great! If we don't, we can part ways respectfully... This could lead to an ongoing friendship and possibly more, but if it only ends up in one or more fun evenings out, that would be great too...

Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement (photo and some general information will be requested to get to know you personally)...

As for me, I like to think that I'm not hard to look at, and I can hold a decent conversation in just about any topic. I think you'd be glad you came out.

I hope to hear from you soon!

MWM seeking a Married or attached wire female for friendship and flirting. If you can relate to also finding this very discreet friendship I would love to hear from you. I am successful in every aspect of my life and simply looking for that one special lady that is missing the spark in her current relationship. I am an educated professional that is fit, does not smoke and has an occasional drink. I am great looking and take pride in my health and appearance and so should you. At 48 I am not perfect but still turn heads. I do not want to end my relationship that I have and neither should you. This is NOT about sex but some innocent flirting would be from. From there who knows but I would want to take this very slow. I am active in my community and in the County so discretion is extremely important.

How cool would it be to meet for coffee, go for a walk or sneak away for a few hours where no one knows us and have lunch. I totally realize this is risky but I can somehow justify this because I am not specifically looking for a sexual relationship. 

You may ask why I am in CL and the answer is simple. I have had opportunities to explore this type of relationship before but never moved on it because the circle of friends is small and I will not pursue this with anyone in the workplace.

Again, I would ask that you are fit, sexy and very honest. Summer is right around the corner and a perfect time for us to enjoy each other's company. 

Just think if this works how cool it would be to get a morning call, text saying good morning and I hope you are having a great day!!

Privacy would always be respected.

Have a great day!!!

Looking for hiking companionship, outdoor friends to explore all the trails this area has to offer.

Ever done the Billy Goat Trail on the MD Great Falls side? I'm looking to try more trails like that, Sugarloaf Mountain and Sky Meadows Park come to mind as well! Down for bike rides once the weather gets better, too. The CCT is a great trail but not exactly challenging, better for bike rides when it warms up.

I'm a 31 year-old SWM, interested in meeting similarly aged women, your status is unimportant as I'm simply seeking out platonic friendships with like-minded people that want to get outdoors! Cannot wait for warmer weather.

Are you curvy and smart? Do you like to cuddle? Have you a dire exigency (or perhaps just a mildly-pressing desire) to find a guy to engage in lively intellectual debates whilst enveloped in his arms and under a warm blanket in a comfy bed? Do you like run-on sentences and rhetorical questions? If you answered yes to at least three of these four questions, then read on oh stalwart Craigslist visitor!

I seek an erudite interlocutor and a curvaceous cuddle-buddy to ameliorate two poignant paucities in my life. So who am I and why should you care? Well here's what I have to offer.

•	I'm tall, dark, and not monstrously hideous!
•	I am big and cuddly, like a bear, but without the mauling and killing and tree climbing ability.
•	I'm not a bum! I have a place to live, a car to drive, a job to pay me money, and I don't even live in my mom's basement anymore!
•	I'm smart! You can show me off to all your friends and they'll be suitably impressed, or you can sic me on them to win all your arguments for you!
•	I have strong arms, a keen mind, a sharp wit and a *really* comfy bed with silk sheets and a super warm blanket!

Note that I'm pretty open as to what kind of relationship develops from this. Anything from friend to soul mate and future wife is just swanky. If you're interested, kindly reply with a picture and some information about yourself.

We could enjoy some adult beverages, cuddle and kiss and make out on the couch like teenagers. Cozy living room with music, a fireplace and soft throws to keep warm.

Please be well groomed, a nonsmoker, and openminded. I have a penchant for easygoing, Caucasian, Asian and Hispanic girl-next-door type but all good kissers may apply.

I am looking for young woman with an old soul. Someone to talk to who would enjoy the company of an thoughtful but aging man for conversation, people watching, motorcycle rides and fun stuff around the city this spring. But please note, I want to be your friend and companion, I do not want to be your sugar daddy. I do not even want to be your daddy. I have kids that I love and am not looking for another one. I understand that if you are younger you will be less financially ready to go out and spend money, and I don't mind paying for stuff, but there's plenty of stuff that we can do around the city that doesn't really require a lot of money. But I think it's na誰ve and condescending to think that the only way an older man and a younger woman can spend time together is by falling into either a sugar daddy relationship or a father daughter relationship. It seems sexist and ageist to think that way. I am divorced and I am happy with being single. I just like meeting different people and have dated and friended women from 18 all the way up to their mid 50s. When I was 15, my best friend was a 80 year old lady on my block who smoked Pall Mall unfiltered. I held her arm as we walked around the block so she could get her exercise. There are qualities to appreciate with everyone across the board, so please, no silly hate mail from haters who want to hate. I am very open to whom I meet and have ads that are for women closer to my own age. And I don't care much about your looks. Just be over 18, honest, kind, and sincere. As for me, I am tall, a deep thinker, a working DC professional but also dabble in art and music in my spare time. I like art, music, culture, politics, and like to get crazy just like anyone else. I am very open-minded and hope you are too. If you'd like to meet somewhere and talk about life, please say hi.

On a fairly regular basis, I see a beautiful woman or a woman with an incredible feature that I would just love to compliment. But you see, I can't. Not just because I'm married, but because it's 2016 and at least 8 times out of 10 if I told a woman she has amazing eyes, she would get totally creeped out. To me this is unfortunate. For many women (and correct me if I'm wrong here) this is interpreted as a forward attempt to sleep with that woman. I can see how a man would like to, but there is a difference between wanting to and attempting to. This is where I feel people get confused. Anyways, back to my original notion.

First, Craigslist is the sewer of on line dating. That said, there are opportunities to help you out.
1. Put in your physical description. A real one. This is the most important thing for male attraction. Don't use words like ""curvy"". Use real measurements like height and weight. Don't bother saying you are cute. That is up to us to decide.
2. If you skipped #1, go back and do that. There is another reason. Not including a description is what spam bots do. 
3. Don't mention wanting a ltr or ""serious guys only"". Every ltr starts off with a first date and most end right there. No shortcuts or spoilers. Take your chances and see what happens.
4. Don't mention your degree. Guys don't care. You are just wasting words.
5. Keep it short. Include just the basics, not your life story. The longer it is, the less likely anyone will read all of it. 
6. If you have a type of guy you prefer (age, body, race) then say so. Don't say ""race doesn't matter"". If you do, you just excluded the 2/3 of men for whom race does matter. And it doesn't matter if you say this because guys of all races will respond anyway.
7. Don't post in casual encounters. That is all spam bots so real men won't even read your ad. 
8. If you post in platonic section, don't say things like ,""friends first then more later"". That's guy code for, ""just sex"". 

Good luck to you all.

the idea is to have you become steeped
in regimens that emphasize your status
as a willing submissive . to help
you develop a mindset willing and anxious
to serve another , to prepare you to eventually
have an '' in-person '' Master. to be in a M/s relationship.

I am a married Hispanic male in my late 30's seeking to have a child with Woman seeking the same. 
My wife is older than I am and already had four children of her own, complete with a tubal ligation when we met and fell in love. We have been married for 17 years and she is very much supportive of my desire to have a child of my own. She does not plan to take on the role of another Mother, but does want to be referred to as the child's God Mother, as we believe this child will be a gift from God for all parties involved. 

I prefer creating this child with a single female or even a lesbian couple, but will also consider a heterosexual couple unable to have a child of their own. I prefer no other man in the mix because I do want to be an active Father in this child's life, however I would consider sharing the role of ""Daddy"" and would encourage you to contact me if you are such a couple that otherwise feels like it may be a good fit for all involved. I also prefer someone who doesn't live too far from Woodbridge VA, as the logistics will be a monthly concern. I am non-smoker, non-drug user and I do not drink alcohol. 

Please contact me via email if you are at all interested in taking this consideration to the next level. I so look forward to hearing from you.

WE are a COUPLE! Seeking a woman whom is interested in exploring some fun experiences with US TOGETHER... 

Looking to have my first experience with a female AND in a threeplay with the right female playmate... We are seeking chemistry, connection, and a female whom will be comfortable with US!

If chosen, YOU will be my first in this to fulfill my fantasy in double... It is important that all things fall into place and have a great time in the making :) ... You should be adventurous as we are looking for a third for preferably ongoing experiences...

About him... a lethal combination of tall, handsome, and sexy...
About her... a ginger with personality, beauty, and sexy to boot...

Both of us are Professional, very Good Looking, Athletic, DD Free, Non-smokers, Drinks Socially, and DO NOT Use/Do Drugs...

Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement... 
We expect to email, chat, exchange pics and speak on the phone prior to meeting... (photo and general information will be inquired to get to know you personally)
NO MALES... NO DRAMA....

Please note: I do not want to engage in convo that leads to a dead end, meaning that no progression is made so we can see were this might lead! Meeting socially to see if we have connection/chemistry with casual conversation, interaction and if we do we can go from there. If we do connect, great! If we don't, we can part ways respectfully... This could lead to an ongoing friendship, but if it only ends up in one or more fun evenings out, that would be great too...

Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement (photo and some general information will be requested to get to know you personally)...
NO MALES. NO DRAMA....

So if you are interested in being a playmate or even possibly part of a triad let us know. Please put ""Respectfully Yours"" in the subject line, include pics, experience, desires and expectations... Please feel free to reply to this email or Kik us if interested: my handle is VenusVegas...

I am seeking a counselor/coach type person -- female only -- and almost surely unlicensed, for discussion and dialog about relationships. But I seek a situation where you are comfortable with me being undressed, fully exposed, during our meetings and discussion. That's not allowed for licensed counselors/therapists, but unlicensed persons have more flexibility. I enjoy talking through my life issues with someone creative and empathic, and in particular am seeking relationship counseling. I am not seeking sex. But physical exposure and expression facilitates verbal revealing.

I have posted before, and have found someone very helpful to talk to, whom I do see on occasion. But I could benefit from additional dialog, and I'd prefer someone closer to home, which for me means Montgomery County. I'd prefer a location in or close to Montgomery County -- upper NW DC is okay, as is nearby PG county.

I am a single man, middle-aged. Apart from discussion about relationships and dating, you'll find that in such other conversation as naturally arises, I'm intelligent, curious, well-educated, thoughtful. I can be pretty funny at times. 

I'd prefer contacts from counselors/coaches who are at least 30 or older, though a bit younger are welcome to make contact. But generally, more experience with life and dating, and closer to my experience, is likely to work better. In deep or personal conversations, I'm usually more at ease with white or Asian women (no disrespect to others, it's just my cultural base); but I am open to women of other ethnicities making contact and seeing where the mutual comfort level is. 

If you answer, please tell me about anything that you've done that's even kind of related -- former therapists and graduate students in counseling are encouraged to reply. But really any articulate, insightful, empathic woman may be right -- a businesswoman, an academic, military, also a massage therapist, nurses, female bartenders, or even an escort (but once again I am not seeking sex here, not intercourse or oral or any such thing here) -- someone with experience in listening to people on the job, may be right for this and for me.

Along with exploring relationship issues, this sort of experience is a chance for me to feel acceptance and companionship in the company of a woman. It's necessary that you be comfortable with a naked man, but also with possible arousal. I emphasize that there would be no sex, and that the conversation and dialog and coaching are a very real part of this, and very important to me. 

If interested, write to me and I can tell you more about what I'm seeking. I will offer reasonable hourly remuneration for your counseling, coaching and listening skills, and for the environment of acceptance you create. ($50/hour, possibly more, negotiable.) Please confirm your age and also confirm that you can host. 

If you're comfortable with it, you can provide a rough indication of where you are located. I would hope, if it works out, that this would be a once or twice a month type experience, ongoing for some time. I am really seeking someone in Montgomery County, MD.

I am not seeking a ""Domme."" A real counselor, even unlicensed, is still someone whom I pay, but who builds a genuine, personal connection, in the sense of really getting to know me and wanting to help me improve my life. If the connection works, a counselor/coach really develops a genuine concern for a client, and can, in a sense, celebrate with the client whatever progress the client makes in improving the quality of his life. I am seeking the kind of human bonding, support and connection that comes from a real counselor. If you are a Domme, either in private life or professionally, you'd probably be comfortable with all this, and I'd welcome hearing from you; but I am not seeking that side of your personality (nor your dungeon space).

I'm a 27 yr old blk male recently getting back into working out again after falling off. Finding it a little harder this time around, so I am looking for another dude to go to the gym with me from time to time to work out, share advice and help each other in our fitness journeys. I live in Pg but my gym is in silver spring. My work schedule is insane so in always in the gym at inconsistent time. Maybe early morning one day or late at night the next. Looking for another guy maybe around my age and height 6'2, but not a requirement. Race is unimportant. The only thing I ask is know your way around the gym. You don't have to be a trainer or cock diesel (but would be great if you were Lls) but at least have some kind of knowledge and be serious about fitness. I also want to take it beyond just a gym buddy but possibly develop a friendship out side of working out. Hit me up with a pic and stats and let's get it in ASAP.

Midlife crisis? Trying to find myself? Reliving my youth? .....or maybe just bored? Who knows and who really cares! :) Yes, I am a married man who is looking for a very fun, flirty, spicy friend to flirt with and possibly meet on semi-regular occasions. I am very busy and you are, too, so our time is valuable and we would make the most of it. I am not looking to change my situation or yours, just add some spice to our life. Not looking for a girlfriend, 'other woman', concubine, or any other synonym for 'drama'. Just looking for fun, no more, no less. Flirty emails and talks are great and can be very hot foreplay. Discretion is a must and you will not know all about me and I will respect your privacy equally. 

You may ask why I am looking if I am married and why not just get a divorce. Well, some of you who are reading this are in a similar situation and know exactly what the deal is. For those of you who don't, well... I have been married over a decade and my wife no longer wants or gives attention. She doesn't like herself and therefore doesn't want attention from me. I have tried and still do but after a while the attempts get old. Factor in kids who don't deserve their life disrupted by separation/divorce, etc. and here we are. 

I am white (your ethnicity doesn't matter to me), 41, professional, keeping things together quite well compared to my peers, athletic, fun, intelligent, emotionally and mentally stable and secure, get my share of attention but never act on it and I want to find a friend who is outside of my own social and professional circles for obvious reasons. 

And you are?

I realize this endeavor has about as much a chance of success as my getting a job at Hooters (these A-minuses I'm rocking are clearly not going to blow anyone's doors off. . .or anything else, for that matter), but, well, worth a shot, right? I mean, it IS Craigslist. . .there are weirdos on here. Like me.

So, what brings me into this den of interweb weirdos? There's no way to say this without sounding douchey, so I'll just say it douchily (that's a word, right?): I need a cuddle. And I'm married.

Yes, I should theoretically get all the cuddling I need at home. But, sadly, circumstances in life seem to be conspiring against that happening, and it's been a long time (years?) since cuddling for the sake of cuddling happened, without all of the attendant pressures and stresses of life intruding on the moment. And I miss that. I miss what it feels like to just get lost in the moment snuggling with someone, feeling them pressed against you, smelling the scent of their hair, just reveling in being close and connected. 

I know what you're thinking--""Hey, dirty old married guy. . .you really just want skeezy sex, but are trying to disguise it as something innocent."" That's what I'd be thinking, too, if I were you. I assure you I'm not, but this is CL, and there are weirdos (like me), so why would you believe me?
Hmm. This may be an insurmountable obstacle. Nonetheless, let's press forward. All of you who are no longer reading might be interested. Or not. Since you're no longer reading.

I'm a 36-year-old white professional with brown hair and blue eyes; 5'9""; 150 pounds; generally pretty good smelling. Pretty good at cuddling (by my own reckoning, at least. . .perhaps that doesn't qualify as a ringing third-party endorsement). And I really want to just get lost, if even for an hour, in being close to someone, snuggling with someone, spooning, holding, etc. Life has been incredibly stressful lately, and that sort of contact sounds so relaxing, so amazingly therapeutic. . .sigh.

I know there are services for this sort of thing, and I've inquired, but haven't had any luck finding anyone who's schedule is compatible or who's close enough to make it work. And, it seems weird to pay for that sort of thing (not that I'm opposed to it), as it feels much better when the other person is just as eager to hold and be held. 

So, what am I looking for? Someone who wants the same thing (I should say a lady who wants the same thing. . .sorry, gents; nothing personal). Someone who's ideally available during the day and can host our snuggling. Someone who has a good sense of humor and will look at this the same way I do: a therapeutic modality that will give us both an escape from the stress of life for a little bit, and a chance connect with someone. 

I realize there's exactly 0 people out there who will fit that description, but there's always hope, right? Let me sweeten the pot: I WILL BRING COOKIES! Or whatever baked good tickles your pickle boat (is that a thing?). How can you say no to THAT? 

We could always meet for coffee or something beforehand, too, just to see if we feel like we want to proceed. Snuggling is intimate, and it might be weird to just show up and say, ""Hey, nice to meet you, little spoon! Get over here!""

If that sounds remotely interesting, I'd love to hear from you. . .I shan't hold my breath, though, as I'm not very good at that anyway. ;)

(Oh, and for those wondering...I really just do mean cookies. Apparently, as I've learned somewhat awkwardly, that word can mean something else on CL...)

This safe hands only massage will enable you to reach levels of arousal you've never experienced or even thought possible before. Relax and Enjoy the sensations of a Tantra Massage given by a handsome guy. 

Your body will be stimulated with skillful manipulation and technique that dates back thousands of years. This is an intimate massage unlike any massage you've ever had. 

The session begins with you lying face down as I relax you with a traditional sensual body rub. You will begin to feel stimulated and aroused. At this point the massage becomes everything but traditional. Your pelvis will involuntarily raise and lower to meet my fingers. As your excitement builds and my fingers become drenched with your arousal you roll over... 

Your body will feel electrified as my hands tease and delicately massage your nipples, your clit, and magical G spot. The pressure within you will build and build and build, until you EXPLODE and convulse in wave after wave after wave of multiple orgasms. The intensity of this type of orgasm will cause you to gush with a flood of vaginal fluid known as female ejaculation. 

You will feel completely drained and satisfied. If you've never experienced this type of massage, or multiple orgasms with female ejaculation, you must experience this.

This is for the person who asked about small breasts. I tried to reply and you took your post right back down. This is what I wanted to say.

I have to say that I am a breast man, but I don't like them too big. Sometimes women with big breasts doesn't always fit their shape. Now, I won't lie myself along with other men love to look at a nice cleavage...but because I have always been a breast man I also love small breasts. I dated two women who had small breasts and I loved their hard nipples. They enjoyed me sucking on them, which made me enjoy it even more. Now, both of them wanted to get fake surgery, and one actually did do it. I told both of them not to do it. 

If you are cool and have a good personality, it shouldn't matter if you have small breasts. A guy like myself would like you for you, and love your breasts no matter what size. You said that you wonder if yours were different would life be easier....well, maybe or maybe not, because some women have back problems, men staring too much and not paying attention to you, or having them in the way and pushing up against your chin at times. So, I say that to say it's not always a good thing.

I hope that I was helpful. Id you want to chat about this more, we can. Or anything else you want to chat about, or get an opinion about.


































Seeking validation. Sometimes I wonder if mine were different would life be easier? Curious to know if men out there are okay with it prefer smaller ones...thanks. No pics given. Subject line: mini

edit: so I went through a phrase of wearing a super push up bra and felt like I got more men willing to spend time with me, which then led to them realizing I was cool. No I will never get fake surgery but I am just saying...I hope my fears aren't true

Kathy: confession is good for the soul 

My significant other claims she can feel it: she has a feeling that I am cheating on her. Perhaps it's because lately I have been often late coming home to her. Plus I thought I was neatly sneaking out to ""have a drink"". However, it makes me feel good to see Kathy at our meeting place just waiting for me endlessly. I give her a 'quicky' then go back home. My girlfriend saw a text and asked me ""who is Kathy?"" 

Kathy is my little secret that I am keeping from her. I love my girlfriend, but I am cheating on her. She doesn't know Kathy, but Kathy knows her; she walks by her almost everyday. 

Kathy's lovemaking makes me feel like I want to do a cartwheel, and even though she knows I can't be tamed, she is always ready to give me some good loving. Honestly, deep down, Kathy's loving makes me feel like I want to change, even though I know I can't change. I have to split my loving between the two because my girlfriend always wants to fight and is watching me. 

I have to tell Kathy to act like she doesn't see me anywhere she sees me. My girlfriend went through my phone and she saw about 6 contacts with the name Kathy, so she just did that evil smile and told me I am too tricky. How is she going to tell me that I am definitely cheating when she never caught me? She says I am a fool but I am not that silly because I saved my top five contact numbers as Kathy.

Hi! For starters if you're a male, please stop reading and move to the next post.

Ok, now that that's out of the way, a bit about me; I'm married, have my Masters Degree, have a great career that keeps me quite busy and as a result I've found that after recently moving to Frederick I don't have many girlfriends. 

Hopefully there's another lady out there who like me has a job they love, a family they adore, but is short on female friends to grab dinner with, workout, talk, get our nails done, etc. My husband is amazing, but he's not exactly the ideal company to go on a girl's day with, to get our nails done, grab lunch and talk about the latest Philippa Gregory novel.

I've got a wide variety of interests from reading, history, sports (NFL and the UFC), movies, politics, cooking, board games, etc.

What I'd love to find in a friend is someone relatively close to my own age, so that we're at similar points in our lives, with similar hobbies. Bonus if like me you're working on losing some weight and getting into shape. I'm on the small side of BBW, capable of 5ks and hard gym workouts, hikes and just about anything else and it would be awesome to find a new friend to help each other stay motivated or to hit the gym with. If you're into any or all of the above things and just looking to make a good friend that you can hang out with, grab dinner, talk about whatever, please drop me a note and tell me something about yourself. I've taken some time to be fairly descriptive about what I'd like in a friend, please do so as well and don't hesitate to ask any questions either. Also please be local to Frederick, MD (less than an hour drive). Pen pals are great, but I'm looking for someone I can also hang out with in the real world.

Just as a reminder to any guys who made it this far, I posted in strictly platonic for a reason and with a specific kind of friend I'm seeking. Please respect that. Thanks!

I like giving slow, caring massages to make you feel good all over. I pay close attention to your body's needs. Through the bio feedback from your body to my hands, through skin contact, I adjust to where you need attention. This may mean going slower, pressing longer and holding, pushing, or being gentle.

Feeling your body relax through my touch is what I am looking for. Verbal direction is also very welcome and encouraged., whether to massage more gently, stronger, pressing and holding longer in certain areas. I hope you like what you read.

I'm not a professional. So I am not charging for these massages. Regular weekly massages are possible.

I'm in good athletic shape, attentive to your needs, and respectful.

Please be able to host. You can be single, married, or attached. Looking for women with a positive outlook on life and good hygiene. Showering before meeting is expected. I have good hygiene and you do, too. Athletes are very welcome, runners, weight lifters, crossfit, martial artist, and yoga practitioners welcome. Most importantly the every day nice woman is wanted. :) I'm athletic and understand how the body feels with exercise and can benefit from some massage, rest, good hydration and healthy food.

Thank you for reading. Please write and tell me what you are interested in, something about yourself, and where you are.

I'm real, gentle, here to care and pamper you for 60 to 90 minutes. What kind of touching and massage would feel good to you? Write and let me know. It is simple and easy.

Pairs of friends like roommates or close friends (females only) are also welcome for shorter length massages. If you're going out with your girlfriend and both of you want a massage (30-45) minutes when you get back home, I can massage both of you, one at a time of course. Both of you can talk and hangout while I massage one, then the other. Very relaxing idea.

I'm a sane, intelligent, emotionally stable, and free thinking guy who is looking for something very different. I would love to develop a long distance friendship/relationship with a woman who will be dating other men and sharing that part of her life with me. Ideally as we get to know one another you will come to think of me as your submissive and completely devoted phone BFF. I'm not looking for phone sex, this will be something much more meaningful and fulfilling for both of us. Our friendship will center almost exclusively around you, and when we talk it will always be all about you and what's going on in your life. I want to become your confidante and the one person in the world that you are comfortable enough to talk to about anything and everything, even other men. 

There's more to this, but by now you probably know already if this is something that interests you or not. If it does and if you like the thought of having a man in your life who will always support you and always be on your side, please write to me.

Hi Jeep Gal,

Are you a Jeep (wrangler) gal, with a nice personality, and experience with adding and removing soft tops from a wrangler? Do you want to make a new Jeep friend? Can you lift a hardtop off a 2-door wrangler with another person? Do yo have a snse of humor? ( You""ll need one!) 

I am looking for a new friend, someone who can help me remove the hardtop off my new 2- door Jeep Wrangler, remove the soft top from the factory without getting tied up into a pretzel, putting the hardtop back on with me, laughing, having a good time, teaching me what you know about soft tops on Jeeps, and making a new Jeep friend.

I could get the dealership to do this with me or herculean lift the hardtop on my back, but why nit make a friend with this? Yes, I am a guy asking for a woman's help. This means I am very secure. If you have the experience, I want your help. Well if you have a Jeep, you're probably cool. It's a Jeep thing. I have asked for directions before when I've been lost. It might have been after crossing into another coutry but still it counts.

This is platonic. I'm happy to return a favor simetime, or take you out for coffee, lunch, dinner, a s oothie, or ice cream. Roads are optional. ""Marty, where we're going, we don't need roads."" Tell me where this quote is from in your response.

I am posting here to avoid creeps and for decorum's sake.

I am legally separated, not yet divorced, after a long marriage that was without romance for the last fifteen years. I am still in the family home with separate quarters. The nest is almost empty.

Talking and listening to people I know well are my basic tools of happiness.



I like to dance 



I like to talk 



I like to listen 



I would like to have a friendship.



I like my job 



Therapy has helped me over the years

I am a professional with my own business 



I haven't had a drink or a drug in over twenty five years (and didn't have a drinking or drugging problem then!).



I believe in love

You don't have a pit bull.



You don't find this posting too affected, or at least you understand that I have to say something while being reserved.


You are still told you look like Catherine Deneuve (or how she used to look!). (JK)


When I have fears that I may cease to be
Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain,
Before high-piled books, in charactery,
Hold like rich garners the full ripened grain;
When I behold, upon the night's starred face,
Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,
And think that I may never live to trace
Their shadows with the magic hand of chance;
And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,
That I shall never look upon thee more,
Never have relish in the faery power
Of unreflecting love--then on the shore
Of the wide world I stand alone, and think
Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.

Have you ever felt like something was just not right with the world? As if you've been living a lie? If you ever seen The Matrix movies, then you know what I'm talking about.

Not saying that we all live in a computer generated world, but I do believe that metaphorically speaking, we do live in a Matrix. Some of the realities are created by other people, organizations and institutions. . .others are created by our own perception of things.

We've been conditioned to believe that only the 'lucky ones' achieve their dreams. . .that only a chosen few will be able to do what they want, when they want and with whom they want.

I call b.s. on that!

Because I have been awakened and I 'unplugged' from the Matrix, I see the world in abundance instead of lack. Now, are there real-life real-world problems out here? Absolutely! But don't get it twisted. . .we each have the power to make major changes in the world. . .but it starts with empowering ourselves, first and foremost.

With the help of fellow empowering part-time (and full-time) entrepreneurs, I get to impact thousands of people's lives from anywhere I choose as long as I have an internet connection.

If you are still reading this, then you may be the person I'm looking to lock arms with. But before I continue, let's take a trip down memory lane. . .

I was born in D.C., but grew up in Hampton Virginia. Growing up, the focus in my family was to go to school, get good grades, and find a high paying job. Pursing my passions was secondary to making sure I had education that would at least land me a safe and secure job.

You and I both know that there is no such thing as job security. And even if there was such a thing. . .it does not guarantee FINANCIAL security. As I learned in Robert Kiyosaki's book Rich Dad Poor Dad, it's not about how much you make, but how much you KEEP.

But I digress. . .so, through most of my scholastic years, I had been an honor roll student. It wasn't until my freshman year at James Madison University did I experience my first major failure. . .long story short; I got academically suspended and could not return for a calendar year.

I felt like a loser. . .how does one go from an A-B honor student to academic suspension? On the outside looking in, it would appear that the only way it could happen is from me simply not caring at all about my education...and that was far from the truth.

It was a shock to my ego, I'll admit. My friends asked were my parents furious at me because I failed so miserably. It was a surprise (even for me) to find out that they weren't furious at all. Perhaps disappointed, but that is my guess because they never expressed disappointment with me for doing so poorly in college.

But this goes a back to the Matrix thing. . ..my perception was that I was a loser, a failure, and that my parents were disappointed with me. . .all because of the expectations I had set for myself.

Fast-forward to 1996, when I decided to serve in the U.S. Navy after a year off from school and working a part-time job as a dessert prep/dishwasher. 

I basically still owed tuition to JMU as well has had to start paying back on the student loan (which wasn't even enough to cover the full tuition in the first place). Most of my buddies had gone into the service in other branches, so I figured the military couldn't be that bad.

I had a great time in the military; traveling the world, meeting different kinds of people. . .little did I know that this experience planted the seed of traveling as a lifestyle. Some of the places I traveled to were Colombia, Jamaica, Venezuela, Aruba, Germany, England, Denmark, Halifax and many more!

I used the time in the Navy to pay off my student debt as well as learn some skills in advanced electronics. I got honorably discharged after serving six years of service. After serving my time I decided to come back home to Virginia.

In 2002, I began work as a shipbuilder, doing electrician work. In the following years, I went from working outside in the elements to being in a climate-controlled cubicle. You would've thought I had 'made it.'

That was far from the truth.

I was not fulfilled.

I witnessed first-hand the office politics and was not down with it.

I have always been a free-spirited person. I do not do well with rules that don't make sense to me. To blindly do things just because 'they said so' never flew with me...especially when I found better ways of doing things.

I soon realized that just because it makes sense, doesn't necessarily mean that we're doing it that way. . .it seemed as if less things made more sense, the more we did them.

Have you had this experience at your job? If so, then you can feel my pain, lol.

It wasn't until after reading Rich Dad Poor Dad in 2007 did the ""entrepreneurial bug"" bit me. I knew there was more to life than working the 40-40-40 Plan (40 hours a week, for 40 years only to get a retirement check 40% of what I'm making now. . .which wasn't enough in the first place), but did not know exactly how to go about looking.

Reading that book opened my eyes to how the money game actually works. I found out why the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and why the middle-class is getting wiped out.

I made a DECISION to make a change.

It was time to let go of the old ways of thinking I had adopted from my elders (no fault of theirs. . .they didn't know what they didn't know and did the best they could with what they had, and I thank them for it).

After a brief dabble into real estate investing, I got introduced to the home based business industry. . .I've been hooked ever since. Now, it didn't come without challenges; and I've had my fair share. 

To name a few:
-I racked up over $70,000 in debt
-I lost my home to foreclosure
-I got my car repossessed twice in a year
-I got my lights shut off every 3 months for a year

As you can see, even though I was making decent money, I wasn't keeping much of it. A lot of it went to over-draft fees, late fees, living beyond my means via credit cards, etc.

I was pretty reckless with my money. I'm sure you know a couple of folks who've been reckless with their funds as well.

There are a lot of things I want to do. I have dreams of becoming financially free; to travel the world and learn different cultures; to take cruises and spend days on the beaches of the world under blue skies and palm trees.

I want to create MY OWN economy without having to depend on a job to do these things. . .and I don't want to have to wait 40 years to save up, only to have the freedom, but not the body to enjoy my freedom, if you know what I mean, lol.

And the best part of creating wealth is the ability to give more. I'm not breaking the bank (yet) but I have tasted what I felt like to earn income leveraging the internet in a way that I don't have to be present for every transaction.

I am building a business while having a life!

I'm not ashamed to say that I currently still work my 9-5, because I know that if my company were to let me go that I already have something in place working for me on my behalf (even as I type this message you're reading).

To have that peace of mind is priceless! I can now go to work without the stress. . .I can deal with the politics because I know that these shenanigans are temporary.

If you want to know more about my challenges and how I overcame them, feel free to add me as a friend on FB; holla at me:
https://www.facebook.com/valentinocrawford

Send me a message and tell me what YOUR DREAMS are and how making an extra income online will help you and your family.

I do read all of my FB messages because I do care. . .but I cannot want something for you more than yourself. I'm not the type to think I'm too good to answer messages. I was once in your shoes and I remember where I came from.

Your future self and your dreams are waiting for you; when will you make a decision meet up with them?

Peace,

Stop holding on to things that you feel you can't share without judgement. Stop carrying things that no longer serve you. When everything else seems so tough, and no one else seems to understand, let me be your soft place to land.

This is strictly for friendship! LESBIANS DO NOT REPLY. I am looking for friends in the Woodbridge area. It would be an A plus if you don't have any kids, in your late 30's single or divorced and you have your own vehicle . I am looking for a friend who can just get up and go, no worries finding a babysitter. I am not from VA. But I could see myself living in VA for the rest of my life. But I have no friends in VA. So I decided to try Craigslist to meet new people. I am a 38 year old AA Female Single With No Kids. I am easy going, fun, friendly, and drama-free . I enjoy going out for coffee, eating out, walking, exercising, going to lounges or clubs sometimes, and movies. I need a movie buddy! lol. If you need someone to talk to and get to know, if so let's meet up! Also have the same interests. Winter is here so I know a lot of people would not want to go anywhere. I need a friend who is willing to get out, of course if it's not snowing outside. Let's get ourselves out there and meet some men! I don't care about race. I do care if you are for real about this post. No bs. I know it takes time to get to know someone. I am not on here to meet people who just want to text and e-mail everyday and not planning to meet at all. Seriously if you're not thinking about hanging out soon please don't reply. 
Stay blessed.

Well, like most friendship ad posts, I am probably looking for a unicorn, but here goes anyway. One thing I've noticed about deep friendships is that they are usually only likely with peers from similar backgrounds, so I am attempting here to give some idea of who I am -- other than ""I like shopping, going to movies, eating out."" (I mean, who doesn't?) 

With that said, I am married with grown kids. I sometimes find single women not to be compatible with me. It doesn't mean we can't be, but when someone is fervently looking for someone special, being around someone who is already attached seems to get in the way of their personal happiness. OTOH, if someone is content with their relationship status, we tend to gel as friends. Because of my situation, I have free time during the day, so I am looking for someone who also has that freedom. Like almost everyone, I have an opinion about politics, but I dislike being around people who are on either end of the political spectrum. I enjoy social drinking. I enjoy working out. I'm not interested in being someone's motivation for getting into shape, so please don't befriend me with that in mind. I tend not to get along with passive-aggressive personality types over the long term. They are too emotionally shut down to be real with. I like being active, especially with all the wonderful places/things in DC to see/do. I like occasional random texting with people who have a dry, witty sense of humor. I enjoy cooking my own meals and eating fairly healthy, although I'm not maniacal about it. (That doesn't mean I don't like to eat out sometimes.) I don't usually hit it off with super-touchy, easily offended types. If you are that unicorn, maybe we can hang out while searching for that pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. No sexual trolls, please

Hello there,

So as the title says, looking for friends and/or if there's a connection, a relationship. As a person I'm pretty laid back, friendly, and sarcastic. I love to laugh, and can usually do a good job at making others do the same. I have a job, car, and a decent sense of where I want to be in the short term future.

I'm 24, 5'9"", 135lbs, gay, and live in the NoVa area. I can send a pic once we get to talking. I'm pretty active as a person, and with the weather getting better I'd like to be outside a bit more. Whether it's tossing a frisbee in a park or walking outside people watching, I'm pretty flexible and enjoy a variety of things. Equally, I do also enjoy being inside watching a movies, playing board games with friends, or just hanging out and chatting about nonsense, lol. I do at the moment have a decent circle of friends, but wouldn't mind adding someone new in my life (preferably someone outside of DC would be nice, though I go there often too). Lastly, like the beginning said, a relationship would be great too if it comes to that.

Anywho, before this gets any longer, lol, if this post piques your interest feel free to send me a message. I posted this in the m4m section, but if you're a girl and happen to see this you can send a message as well. :)

If you send a pic, I'll send a pic as well and go from there. Hope to hear from you. :)

Hi there! So like the title says (Spoiler Alert) I'm gay (Haha) and looking for a female friend. :) I have a decent circle of friends, however, 75% are male. Adding a female to the circle would be nice...and I suppose this is where you come in! Lol.

A little about me, I'm 24, 5'9"", and live in the NOVA area. I can send a pic of myself if we get around to talking. In general I'm a pretty nice person, like to laugh, friendly, sarcastic, and get along with most people. I have a job, a car, and pretty stable with life. I'm also active too, and like to do stuff like play frisbee, kickball, hiking, etc. With the weather getting better it would be nice to do more outside. Though, I'm just as cool with doing indoor stuff, like going to the movies, eating out, shopping, etc.

So yeah, if any of this piques your interested, send a message and I suppose we can get around to talking and maybe become friends. Hope to hear from you. :)

Do you, or know a friend that does professional WAX in a salon or a spa in the Montgomery County area? Reason I ask is because I wanted to try to find someone that would attempt to wax my scalp. I've asked a million times in a salon - nobody will touch it (from the videos I've seen, it may take a few hours or multiple sessions). Anyway, I figured maybe I could find someone that waxed professionally and see if they could try it sometime after work. Thanks!

Me - 47 but in the shape of a 27 year old. I workout, kickbox, run track and trails, do crossfit, play tennis, swim and soccer. 

I am looking for a female buddy who has a discipline for staying in shape who would like to join me for outside crossfit workouts now that the weather is getting nice. I can do sat/sun late mornings, and evenings 1-2 days during the week. With schools still in session, need to work around field and track practice schedules for weekdays but weekends seem pretty wide open.

I bring travel weights (long bar and dumbells), jump ropes, agility cones, and a few other pieces of equipment to the local Quince Orchard HS where I can easily back up to unload my equipment near the track.

Routine is about hour/hour and 15 mins. My typical workout includes intervals of weights, quarter mile runs, calisthenics (pull ups, push ups, rope, etc), and some agility work with cones. I can guarantee I will have you sweating like never before, and looking your best within 4-5 workouts....crossfit tones and strengthens you fast and like to other workout combo. So come out and join me..and feel the burn!!!!

If interested please get back to me. Thanks!!!

I used to have a great concert buddy. We introduced each other to different groups and went to shows that nobody else would go to. We got to be more general friends. It was a great. 

Now she is in California or something. In any event, not here. I find shows I'd like to go to, and I have nobody to go with. You know cool shows and want to invite me. Why aren't we friends?

About me: I am 30s, 6'3"", fit, and attractive. I'm a nonprofit lawyer/policy wonk. You know the type. My first love is 90s hip hop. I grew up in Seattle, so even if I once tried to deny it, I like stuff with, like, guitars and stuff too. Stuff. I loved the O Brother, Where Art Thou soundtrack and some bluegrass kinda stuff. Jazz. I love Jazz. The 930 Club is one of my favorite places in DC. My old concert buddy took me to see Cold War Kids. That was awesome. In short, I'll go see anything with you

Are you cute? Do you like music? Like maybe obscure stuff sometimes? Suggest shows to me, and I'll cover tickets. I'm going to see Del at U Street Music Hall in May; maybe that would be a good start. Come to shows I want to go to so I don't have to be that guy alone and nursing a beer while I wait through down time between acts. It will be fun. And if it's not--you can disappear into the crowd and never see me again.

So cards on the table, here is what I'm looking for: someone witty and bitingly sarcastic who knows how to use a semicolon, who shares my cynical world view while also seeing the inherent goodness in humanity. She should be fit and easy on the eyes. I want to chat during the day and share occasional happy hours. And, if it all works out and we connect, I want to go down on you--no reciprocation necessary; I would eagerly engage in post orgasm(s?) cuddling at your discretion. This would, of course, only follow serious chemistry establishment.

Here's the catch: I am tall and fit and attractive. That's not really what one typically means by a ""catch,"" you say? You haven't been on craigslist long, I retort. I'm also witty and charming and respectful of normal social mores. That is to say, I am confident that even if our banter only lasts three emails and you change your mind, you won't be permanently creeped out. Seriously, I am a great guy with a particular need. Stranger things have happened.

I mean, give it a shot. Worst case: you trade a couple of emails and decide I'm an idiot. Best case: you make a new friend who will make you laugh and give you mind blowing orgasms. High upside.

So what are verbal benefits you ask?? Well I'm seeking someone that's a good communicator. Someone that's open minded and willing to talk about nearly any subject. Someone that's honest and tells it like it is without sugar coating it. Someone that will hold her end of the conversation and ask plenty of questions in return. Someone that intrigues me, makes me laugh, makes me think, makes me want to explore you more. 

I would prefer if you are 30-50, but you don't have to be. 
I would prefer if you are married or attached, but you don't have to be. 
I would prefer if you are attractive, but you don't have to be. 
I would prefer if you are somewhat local to the DC area, but you don't have to be. 
I would prefer if you are a female. This is a must, no buts allowed. Lol

As for me, I'm married, 40 years young, father, professional, smart, fun and playful, active, handsome, open minded, flirtatious, sarcastic, and eager to develop a new friendship. I'm open to meeting down the road if we connect but perfectly happy to keep this online only. 

One last request, if you want to talk, please make your response interesting. ""Hi there"" responses aren't responses. 

Looking forward to hearing from you

My colleague and myself are hosting a poker party on Saturday, April 9th from 7:00 - 11:00 pm. The poker party consists of my law colleagues: lawyers, paralegals, support staff, and vendors. We hold this semi-annual poker party as a way for us to unwind, play some poker, and just have a good time. 

We are currently seeking 3 to 4 women to serve beverages, alcoholic and non-alcoholic, that we provide, serve food (chips, hors d'oeuvres, pizza, etc.), which we also provide, and to add a certain fun and entertaining environment for the players. The servers pretty much set the tone of the party, however, the eveningt revolves around the game itself. The female servers should be fun, personable, and gregarious. The attire for the servers will be black bikinis and high heels (which we do not provide). 

The compensation for the event will be $25/hour, which totals $100 for the whole event; this will be paid upon arrival. Also, in addition to the compensation, you will receive tips from the poker players themselves. 

If interested please email me your first name, a picture, face and body shot (NOT NUDE), and an email address where you can be contacted.

Ladies,

Are there certain sides to you or even things that you secretly like but are too shy, afraid or embarrassed to admit to the people you're close to because of the feeling that they'll misjudge you or start looking at you differently, think that you're weird because of what you like and/or don't like? Is there anything that you would like to do with someone or would want someone to do for you but in your mind you feel that whatever it is may creep them out or that they will immediately decline because of whatever the request or desire may entail? Feel that others will not ever truly understand and accept the real you so you keep the real you hidden within?

Well fear not... you are not alone. I'm just like you. I love meeting new people and will gladly share my interests, passions and desires with anyone who is willing to listen and accept me for who I am and what I like and/or dislike. I do not judge others for their quirks and I certainly try not to knock something before trying it. After all, you could end up liking or disliking it too and can therfore see things from another person's point of view.

With that said, ladies please feel free to send a reply. Don't be shy. Let's be friends and get to know the real us through one another. Share with me your personality, your lifestyle, your likes and your dislikes. I will gladly share with you the same. Who knows, maybe I might like and or dislike the same things that you do and vice versa. Let's chat!! :-)

THAT BEING SAID, I am not one to shove my baggage on others. I am good at tucking it away for when I am alone so I don't need someone to rant or vent to. I need some friends to hang out with- hit Phase1 or Cobalt. Freddy's for a lunch. Gear up for the Pride events in June which I usually like to try and volunteer for. I need some friends who are as social as I am because I refuse to sit and suffer. onto bigger and better things and hopefully a few hot girls along the way.

If chosen, YOU will be my first in this to fulfill my fantasy in double... It is important that all things fall into place and have a great time in the making :) ... You should be adventurous as we are looking for a third for preferably ongoing experiences...

About him... a lethal combination of tall, handsome, and sexy...
About her... a ginger with personality, beauty, and sexy to boot...

Both of us are Professional, very Good Looking, Athletic, DD Free, Non-smokers, Drinks Socially, and DO NOT Use/Do Drugs...

Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement... 
We expect to email, chat, exchange pics and speak on the phone prior to meeting... (photo and general information will be inquired to get to know you personally)
NO MALES... NO DRAMA....

Please note: I do not want to engage in convo that leads to a dead end, meaning that no progression is made so we can see were this might lead! Meeting socially to see if we have connection/chemistry with casual conversation, interaction and if we do we can go from there. If we do connect, great! If we don't, we can part ways respectfully... This could lead to an ongoing friendship, but if it only ends up in one or more fun evenings out, that would be great too...

Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement (photo and some general information will be requested to get to know you personally)...

So if you are interested in being a playmate or even possibly part of a triad let us know. Please put ""Respectfully Yours"" in the subject line, include pics, experience, desires and expectations... Please feel free to reply to this email or Kik us if interested: my handle is VenusVegas...

Here it goes:

I'll likely be chaperoning my son's field trip in May and after his symphonic performance, the kids are free to roam all day long (without parental supervision) meaning I'll be by myself all day. It would be ideal to have someone meet me at the park so we could essentially hang out all day. I LOVE roller-coaster's but don't want to end up going on them by myself. It's so much more fun when you have someone to share the thrill with. Typically I wouldn't really mind about your age, but in this case I do prefer you be around 28-35 age range and definitely ""fit enough"" to not be told you can't ride on the roller-coaster because the seat belt won't lock lol.

I'm very cute and fun to be around so I would expect the same. I'm not looking for anything serious, just 2 good looking people having a good time. The exact date will be determined soon, but it definitely IS on a Friday. So come on whatta ya say? Let's have fun together! 

I won't respond to one liners, so please let me know why you would be interested in going, etc etc. Feel free to attach a picture and I'll reciprocate if I think we would hit it off. Either way let's chat and see if you want to be spontaneous for the day. 

Talk soon!

Hi! Thanks for reading my post. I am known around the city by a lot of the museums and galleries. I attend lectures on a regular basis. I usually like the big names and famous people with international recognition. I enjoy lectures on art, physics, poetry and many other subjects. I sometimes talk a little rapidly, but for those with an interest in what I am talking about it usually is well received. For instance, this morning I was having a lovely exchange with a barista putting on a presentation on four types of coffee she was brewing and we discussed different types of beans a and brewing techniques. I also was talking with a lovely architect from Wisconsin and we were toe to toe in discussing the development in Washington, with different architects and developers. Then I briskly hung out at SAAM for some coffee, tea, and to ride their WIFI in the LUCE area of the gallery. Then, I ran to the NGA for a classical mandolin concert with an excellent percussionist, with a dessert of one of the last documentaries of a famous icon in filmography. This is actually being written unbeknownst to me in fictional form by a friend of mine trying to set me up. 

If you like to solder or stand in lines I'd love to buy your old solder gun, or pay you to stand in line for Congressional hearings/ All jokes aside, if you like art and running around the city I am always availed to company.

This post if for my friend. Yes, I am a match maker like the movie, ""Fiddler on the Roof."" But, this is about him and not me.

6'2, thin swimmer's build, blond hair, with a very mild mannered look about him. He actually has great endurance too as he rides his bicycle to and from the city for arts and cultural events to include, tech start-ups, art receptions, conventions, ceremonies, independence days, lectures, etc. If it has a good reception, then more than likely he is interested. He also likes to memorize poetry and is able to recite it. He sells used books and frequents estate sales, libraries, and all sorts of places with dust and the smell of old things. You can also find him on Sunday at the flea market in Georgetown selling his jewelry which is another side job of his. He also does a d.j. show playing music of his choosing usually with some quirky poetic messages usually with strong female roles such as Goldfrapp.

I think, but I could have the wrong author, but he likes the Emily Dickinson look. WASPY, nerdish, plain, dry lips, a bit odd, awkward, au naturel in all ways, shy, people are somewhat his type. We recently saw a movie with Anne Heche and he found her short hair and disco dancing hot. 

He is somewhat in a ""Catch 22"" situation as he never approaches anyone, and the type of person he likes would never approach him. So, he is left memorizing this poetry with no one to recite it to.

Hello Land of the Free! You don't even know how much you've been missed.

This is a request. Or maybe... several requests.

First off, if you are not familiar with a lot of the new research that been established, please take some time to do so.

The National Institutes of Health has determined by way of PATENT 6630507 the MANY benefits and potential benefits of the cannabis plant. To understand why this is not more widely available information- would be a completely different task... but not at all separate , so please, pick whatever ways and means suit you best. Just please don't be uninformed anymore...

That being said, we are medical refugees, not political refugees. Not yet anyway. Again, that would be an environment that I do not have experience in. I try to stay informed as best I can while also remembering that there are usually two sides to every story- and somewhere in the middle is often where the truth will lie. And the further away you are from an event- the less you will actually know about it. So I'm not too far away from... NIH... or a politician that actually seems to be ' getting it ' , along with the integrity to back up her words. As I am grateful for that, unfortunately, we are not close enough.

We are just across the river. Strange that I've been here almost my entire life- but don't think I know anybody on the other side. And a nuisance to try due to the high traffic and expense that it has always been to visit Our Nation's Capitol- again, an argument that I am only prepared to complain about- with no authority or expertise to make much more of a concise argument other than ' I don't like it. '. But along with any of those arguments, as an ordinary citizen, I can sense a large political divide between the neighboring areas. Even within my own Commonwealth, which is significantly larger than the D and the M portions of this tri state ( DMV ) area put together. From my experience as a constitute of Northern Virginia for so long, I would bet that there would be very little progress towards some of the initiatives that have already been established (and in the Districts recent case, trailblazed) in the neighboring States concerning the use of medical cannabis.

In my advancing years, I have always served myself and learned what works best for me- , mentally and environmentally- as people generally do while... living their lives... furnishing their homes, choosing their careers, cooking their food, deciding what to wear, investing, raising their children and voting, etc. I have realized the benefits that cannabis has provided for me while struggling with anxiety, ADHD, and the side effects of the medications typically used to treat these disorders - even prior to the research of the benefits of cannabis used for these conditions was established. But the issue has never been raised in the Commonwealth on any significant scale outside mostly just conversations amongst like minded people. So I include myself in that, shake my head a lot and go on serving myself and my family.

A couple of years ago, my daughter presented with severe inflammation in all parts of her eye and into intra cranial hypertension- essentially diagnosed as idiopathic. The doctors believe that it is considered an auto immune disorder- which in many aspects is also considered idiopathic. And the ' treatments ' of many auto immune disorders are pretty intense, including chemotherapy and other immune suppressant pharmaceuticals that have less than a couple of decades worth of research backing them. After a couple of years of these treatments - with no real improvement- it seems as if the experts are satisfied with 'maintaining', slowing the progression of, or prolonging what they idiopathically THINK is inevitable.

While conducting my own research, my daughter's conditions are collectively considered ' secondary glaucoma '- a condition that has been treated with cannabis for a very long time.

And with the recent discoveries made in the properties of the cannabis plant that reduce inflammation and treat autoimmune disorders, it would be only logical for me to want to try this method for my daughter who has had no success with pharmaceutical treatments- but only negative side effects.

The cannabis plant has also been proven to alleviate the negative side effects of chemotherapy- so again, why wouldn't I want to pursue this treatment for my daughter? 

And why anyone would engage me in a debate while my daughter is going blind?

Because the research is in. Many of the beneficial properties of the cannabis plant do not even include the THC component- the part that produces the 'high' that many people associate with the cannabis plant. And of course, these patients do not generally get their medication in a form that they have to smoke.

As a desperate parent, I have conducted some rather intensive research on how to help my child. I discovered a few ' loopholes ' in order to get my daughter approved as a medical marijuana patient. Which, with the help of a few more progressive States- I was essentially able to accomplish... but only as close as Oregon. Which seems a bit absurd to me if I can't even afford a trip across the river...

In this trying economy, it has been challenging for just about everyone. Especially for those who were financially disadvantaged to begin with. About the worst time imaginable to be dealing with a chronic and idiopathic disease. Particularly with the enormous cost of specialists and medications... that AREN'T working!!! 

Because of all of this now, along with some other life changing events, I have essentially found myself homeless- although I have been established in Northern Virginia almost my entire life, I have been able to survive with a little help from my friends.

My primary focus of course is my daughter's health.

A move across the river would probably not be too inconceivable- although I do not have the means ( finances, credit or contacts ) in the District to get myself established. Nor do I feel that I have the luxury of establishing a 1 year residency in order to get the help that I need. I understand The District of Colombia has an enormous homeless population. I don't see where I could get much help going from being homeless in a place where I am familiar and established to being homeless in a place where I know no one or have nothing.

I am- aside from having the obligations of caring for my daughter, essentially- employable in any of my previous occupational fields- and anxious to resume whatever kind of normalcy I can achieve given our current circumstances. What I am asking for here is a chance at that possibility.

If there is anyone, anyone at all- that can... relate... or possibly assist in any way- I am open to any suggestion.

I am a 44 year old, single mom- with no criminal history whatsoever, just trying to help my daughter lead a normal, healthy life.

I am open to ideas, information, leads, employment and the opportunity to meet anyone in a position that could possibly help... or who may need some help- in exchange for a usable address in Washington DC so that I can try to save my daughter's vision.

In the meantime, thank you for your attention and good health to all. Regardless of your zip code.

Hopefully

Hey y'all! 

It's spring break! Well, at least it is for me. It'll be warming up soon (Hopefully), so that means swimsuit weather! Only problem, shopping for said swimsuit. Yeah.

I'm looking for a FWB type of situation with a mature, intelligent, sexy, confident woman with curves. Someone who misses those feelings (tingling all over) you get right after making a ""connection"" with someone. That excited feeling you get when you receive a new email, text, or call from your secret lover. Being aroused when you hear their voice or see a new sexy photo they've sent. Constantly yearning for the next time when you can be together and thinking about them when you go to sleep each night. Basically, I miss the hunt and all the things that go with that. If you're married or attached, no problem as I am too however, the passion died years ago. I promise discretion is just as important to me as it is to you. 

Being verbal when making love, enjoy wearing sexy lingerie, love receiving oral and sitting on a mans face are all +++

With that said, here's a bit about me. I'm a 53 year old athletic, easy going, uninhibited, adventurous, DDF, MWM with a very high libido. I enjoy meeting new people, good conversation and if we seem to have a mental connection, I'm definitely open to seeing if we have a physical one as well. I'm a very giving person as I get pleasure out of giving pleasure. I enjoy long sessions of foreplay and teasing as it helps heighten arousal. I can be slow and sensual or more aggressive and somewhat kinky. I would also be interested in switching roles I you like. 

Anyway, if you're interested, please get back to me and we can chat more. Please include a pic or two and change the subject line to your favorite color to weed out spam. 
Have a great day!

Don't know where all the time has gone. You wake up one day and you realize you are not happy with your life. You feel like something is missing. You find yourself sleeping walking through life. You have a busy life, your married, but you just go through the motions. You miss laughing, joking, romance, sparks. You yearn to find someone that can fulfill that void. Someone you can trust. Someone you look forward to communicating with. Someone to put pep back into your step. Someone whose kiss sends shivers through out your body. Does this describe you? It does describe me and I would like to experience those feelings again, even if they lead to nothing more than a beautiful friendship, built on communication and mental intimacy.

As the weather will be changing really soon, it makes me think of all the fun I want to experience this spring/summer. Although CL can be an awkward place to meet potentially good friends I thought i'd give it one last try.

A little about me, I'm outgoing, open minded, employed and will be in school part time. I like to explore new places, I love all types of music, love to cook, shop, get my nails done, sip red wine and watch movies, talk about current events. I find the beach peaceful, I love to travel, I like to write from time to time, I love chill atmosphere's and I recently started working out again and it'll be a plus if you would like to go walking at a track or trail since the weather is getting better.

Hello!

Although Craigslist isn't the ideal place to find friends, when you're an introvert who has absolutely no social activities they engage in it is pretty much your only option (as far as I know they haven't made a Tinder for best friends for life yet). So it's a little awkward but it's worth a shot. 

I'm 22 year old white female nurse. I'm happily married with no kids (although we are trying to have one...so somebody in a similar life stage would be awesome). I'm an avid pole dancing enthusiast (have been out of practice the past few months but working on getting back into it.) and enjoy shooting at the NRA range (I'm a newbie but it's fun!). I also enjoy reading when I get the time and of course all the things that most girls love: shopping, getting my nails done, eating out, etc etc. I'm very driven in my career and would prefer to meet someone who also takes their career seriously. I watch very little TV, and I think there is a lot of more productive things you can do then sit in front of the tube. I identify as bisexual but I really just looking for a friend. I did the fwb route and it really just ended in a lot of heartache, so instead of having a fwb who may last for a little while, I'd prefer to develop a friendship that lasts a lifetime. 

In a friend I'm looking for someone who is preferably attached (married, engaged, etc) as I have had more success in the past with friends who aren't ""on the prowl"" so to speak. Like I said earlier in my ad, my husband and I are trying to conceive so someone in a similar life stage would be nice. Other than that, I just ask that you be intelligent, be able to hold a conversation, mature, honest, driven in whatever it is you do in life, and open minded. Let's be fun/silly/quirky together. I have a flexible work schedule that allows me a lot of time during the week to do things (perks of being a nurse!). I want someone who would be just as content to come over to my house and watch/help me organize a room as they would be going out to the mall together. It seems true friendship is rare these days but if I could just have one truly good friend, I would be happy. I don't want someone who is super clingy and needs constant attention, but having someone to chat with on a daily ish basis would be cool. 

Send me a bit about yourself (more than one line please!!), what you're looking for, and a picture (helps to know who you're talking to). I'd preferably like to text/email back and forth a bit before we met as I am introverted, but once you get to know me I'm loud, fun and quirky. I'm the subject line put your favorite movie. Mine is Silence of the Lambs. 

Looking for in a similar age range as me too 20-35? 

I'm curious to see what the Craigslist gods bring me :D



No men. No couples. No mouth breathers. Thank you!

I have almost everything I could want in life except a female best friend. I don't usually get along with with other females because I usually am just one of the guys. If you've felt this way, read on.

I'm sassy. I'm crass. I like to laugh (loudly). I make fun of people and don't mind being ribbed in return. I dance like no one is looking all the time. I talk to strangers regularly. I'm a people person. I enjoy impromptu get togethers. I'm also a pierced, dyed haired (sometimes), big geek at my core, not because it's ""in"" right now but because that's what generally interest me. I could care less if you wear makeup and fashionable clothes and care more about if you're fun and a good person. I also identify as a kinkster. I won't impose it on but feel if I really want to find a good friend, it's something they should know since it's a part of me.

My fave things are...
Netflix binge sessions
Planning my zombie apocalypse escape plan
Aimless current event talking with music playing in the background
On the fly mini road trips

If any of this sounds like you or you're looking for this type of friend then you should write me. I'm a loyal and dependable friend and most of my circle of friends I've known for years. I'm just hoping to add a ballsy female like myself to my group.

Want to know more? I'm happy to share. Just shoot me a message and we'll get chatting. I don't mind taking some time to get to know you online before meeting but am not looking for endless emailing. If you're into drama, self-loathing, being flakey (read: being excessively late to things ugh), and generally making everything about you, we most definitely shouldn't cross paths. Also I'd like to find someone who doesn't have children (more flexibility) and isn't entirely new to this area as I don't like playing tour guide/

Well rounded girls, fellow kinkster girls, and geek girls get quicker responses. Hope to hear from you!

How's it going? Here's wants going on I'm going on a birthday get-away for a close friend to Atlantic City NJ Friday March 11th - 13th with a couple of professional working friends, the group that you see in the pictures above is them. It's going to be alot of fun and we will be going out maybe almost every night my friend's birthday is the 21st but we'll be celebrating his birthday next weekend.

What I'm searching for:

I would love to find a charming, respectable, fun female age 22-30 who will love to come with me and keep me company with my friends it's not me trying to start a relationship it's so I don't feel left out when everyone and thier dates have fun for the entire night. Drinking,Strippers etc will be happening so please be open minded and at least a social drinker.

The Cost & What's In It For You:

Well, first and foremost I'm not looking for a female who's seriously picky. However I will probably be getting a room with double beds and most likely probably driving with my best friend or maybe getting a rental car not sure yet to Atlantic City NJ which is only 3 hours away. One thing for sure if I'm down to the wire I'm willing to pay/ reimburse you for your time with me on this get-away. (Also would be great to have a new friend) We will need to meet this weekend to talk more about details.

Just wonder about Craigslist and dating. I have posted a couple of ads and except for spam, got zero replies both times. 

I'm supposedly everything most women say they are looking for. In other words a great catch.

So as a woman, do you ever respond sincerely to ads men post? 

Thank you very much for your help and talking the time to reply!

Straight older bro looking for a straight younger bro.

I'm 31 straight, fit, masculine, told I'm good looking. I like to do a lot of outdoor sports like camping, paintball, biking, tennis, swimming. I workout a lot. I like going to pro sporting events, but I don't necessarily follow sports. 

All my siblings are much older than me and live in a different state. I've always wanted to have a younger bro to hang out with. I'm looking for a straight masculine guy from 18-28. If you could use an older bro let me know. Nothing weird!

Lets Meet at the Sculpture Garden for some ice skating. 

It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or Olympic caliber-- just have the desire to get out, enjoy the ice and get a good workout. 

As of 2/9/16 I've gone to the Sculpture Garden about 35 times since it opened for the season on 11/14/15. I love the exhilaration and pleasure that ice skating brings. After skating, we could stop into the cafe which is adjacent to the rink.

These days/times are best for me. Just let me know what works for you.

Monday evenings 7:00-9:00PM 
Tuesday mornings, afternoons or evenings 
Wednesday mornings, afternoons or evenings 
Friday evenings 7-9, 8-10, or 9-11 
Saturday evenings 7-9, 8-10, or 9-11 
Sunday evenings 7-9 

I'm single--very fit, healthy, fun and have a youthful look and mindset. I guess I'm an intermediate skater -- way beyond a beginner but nowhere near an expert. I live in Old Town, Alexandria. When the outdoor rinks close in mid March, my skating will be at the Mount Vernon Rec Center (2017 Belle View Boulevard Alexandria, VA 22307)

What does your Friday have in store for you? I'd love to know! Are you in the same position as me? You have that empty space in your heart that you know deserves to be filled but time after time things always seem to end the same? Empty. I'll be 30 before I know it, and have a lot to look back on and be happy and proud about, but as of now I don't have that one part of my life I thought I'd have figured out by now for sure, and that's finding that special someone. 

I could type pages of myself, my life, what I'm looking for, but all of that seems a bit ahead of itself. I'll keep it simple for now. I'm a sweet, caring, loving guy who has a heart bigger than the world to give to someone that has the same to give in return. I've been told several times from previous relationships that I'm not like anyone they have met. Let's start slow, with the simple things, but time is always of the essence. We could exchange emails back and forth and hopefully have a phone conversation if we click. I hope you have a wonderful day!

Considerably attractive, naturally feminine lady. Highly skilled professional. In my leisure, I would love to have someone refreshing to do things with- concerts, movies, walks, road trips...dining in & out... and more.
I appreciate someone with a good head on their shoulders, a good heart and soul, responsible, unattached, dependable and a committed friend. I require honesty. .. good communication too. I require someone healthy, clean, thin - average figure. I wish to spend time with someone that, even if I'm not intimate with them; I think about being that way...so I desire a pretty, fit, attractive individual to be around.

Seeking a mature, secure friend (preferably mid 30s ---early 40s.) Enrich my life. I have time on my hands to get to know someone of quality. I seek to hang out, and see what may develop from just talking and being in each other's presence. I desire this to be a one on one experience. 
Safe... something to always look forward to.

I'm thinking instead of heading downtown and meeting random girls at bars or a danceclub and buying them drinks. Maybe you are nice girl and you're thinking the same thing so why not go together and I'll buy you drinks and have a good time. Let me know, I'm open to suggestions.

It's been really hard for me to make friends so I decided to post this on CL and try my luck. I'm African American,straight, 5'5, slim. 
I'm very open minded and I enjoy traveling and going out to do fun things(shopping,movies,go karting,etc). Not big on clubbing and I don't smoke (don't mind if you do). I'm a bit shy at first, enjoy holding deep conversations and I'm a college student.
I don't mind any race, religion etc as long as you're genuinely open minded and understanding. I prefer 20-24 yo, someone who actually loves travelling once in a while and it will be better if you live nearby (Greenbelt, hyattsville, Beltsville, Laurel, Silverspring). So if you are also looking for a best friend that you can text a lot with, hang out often with and share memories together... Send an email and tell me about yourself. Please be a able to verify you're real via snapchat, FaceTime or any other video chat :-)

Hi

I want to go check out a movie tonight or this weekend. Now I am recently single and looking to stay that way, but I do need to replace my ""movie buddy"" if you will. So anyone interested in maybe getting a couple of drinks or a quick bite so we can chat a bit and feel each other out before catching a movie well, I'd love to hear from you...I've been looking forward to this sequel since I loved the first one, nothing like a good old dose of an 80's throwback action movie. All you need is an improbable plot, tons of action, plenty of gore and just add water and you got a good time, just leave your brain at home. Now chances are that this might be epically bad, but I'm willing to risk it if you are. 

I obviously posted this in the strictly platonic section, but I will be honest that I am big flirt and would like to categorize this as strictly-ish, since I'm open to whatever may happen. I'm 32, of mixed race, brown skin, love to just hang and have a good time. I would like to find someone who is fun, a great conversationalist and who is pretty open minded and might want to make this a regular thing. Race doesn't matter and please, no older than 36.

Anyone up for meeting up for a couple of drinks and some conversation. I'm truly not searching for sex or a date or any of that. Just got out of a long relationship and to be honest it's about the last thing I need. But do miss just having a fun attractive woman to talk to and just have a good time with. Maybe this is could be the start of a regular thing..Happy Hours, random outings etc etc. I'm 32, of mixed race, pretty laid back, well traveled, educated, and would like to meet someone who fits some of those same qualities. Oh it wouldn't hurt if you are smoking hot either, but that's just an aesthetic thing, deep down just be fun, light hearted, understanding, and please don't be one of those women who will unknowingly spend 2 hours informing me of all the drama in her life and then tell me that I'm such a great friend and it was great talking to me. I mean I am a great listener and I am very empathetic to what anyone may be going through, but PLEASE I want to go out to have some fun and so should you, I don't want to be your therapist and I don't need you to be mine. If we can adhere to that then we should get along great. Oh and please be able to talk about more than just pop culture....

Anyone else out there feeling troubled, lonely, or alone? Maybe we can talk and meet, and can help each other through this. I could use a close friend, and I'm open to more if anything develops, but it isn't necessary unless it works for both of us.

I have lost touch with most of my relatives, or in some cases, they have passed away. Most of my closer friends have moved away, or are at previous workplaces or part of activities that I no longer participate.

I have met a few people on CL or at various places throughout the DMV, but no real friendships or relationships have materialized. I've been surprised that so many people have hidden agendas. It has been disappointing.

I'm open to meeting anyone and your personal situation doesn't matter, as long as you are really looking to meet and spend time with a potential good friend, boyfriend, and/or lover in me. I'm not looking for an extended email exchange, so the sooner we can meet, the better. Let's work through this and build something special together. Your age, race, religion, etc. doesn't matter either.....I relate well to all and am very flexible and open minded. I only ask that you are serious about trying this, and are clean and DDF.

I'm really looking forward to hearing from you. Please introduce yourself a little when you reply, and put your favorite movie in the title to help me eliminate the SPAM. I don't need to see your pic because I care more about who you are rather than what you look like; however, if you want me to send you a pic, I expect you to send me yours first. 

Thanks.

Hello there!

Do you want to meet someone who is good natured, funny, sometimes argumentive, sarcastic, bold, honest, open, nonjudgemental, intelligent, hispanic, present, and helpful?
All those adjectives describe me. I'm not important; just a man who loves being a guy, who does many cool things, who won't bring you down, who understands your divinity. I post on here becuase I'm not actively seeking a girlfriend or wife. Maybe someone who thinks they are cool and wouldn't mind sharing that omnipresent love with each other and I'm not talking about sex. Time moves so fast but time shared with a good woman is to me beautiful and we'll worth the trouble. 
A friend first who likes to try, smell, see, feel, and experience the world. 
If you want, reply to this ad. I am real, if you are as well, ask for a pic or my number. Whatever makes you more comfortable as CL runs the gamut in what the world can offer.

It just hit me today that after living in Takoma for 2.5 years, I still have zero friends in the area (the realization came when I saw an attractive guy waiting to cross the street next to me, and I was like ""damn, why don't I know anyone around here?"") . Most of my friends live in DC proper, and that's where I do all of my socializing. However, I do love so many spots around Takoma and TKPK, and it would be great if on some weeknights or Sundays, when I'm too lazy to make the commute on the red line, I had someone with whom I could grab drinks at Republic, or food at Mark's Kitchen, Busboys, Evolve, etc. 

I'm pretty fun and easygoing, love art, animals, cinema, and languages. It'd be awesome to meet someone with similar interests within a walking distance from me. I'm mostly looking for friends, of any gender and sexual orientation, but cute local single guys looking for something more won't be turned away either (no dick pics though!).

Do we just follow the directions or create it?
I've seen and done much in fifty-one years but still have the drive to make a better life for the future. Will you be the drop in the pond sending waves rushing to the shore?

When our own lives are so brief yet filled with passion, curiosity, humility and joy.
We build our universe with family, friends, work, play and the one loved most of all.

Why is it so hard to chat with a real person. They chat a few days and the convo is awesome, then boom they disappear. Or better yet they ask for a pic and you send it and then I ask for one and they say their phone is broke or they don't have one. I call total bull shit.

I am athletic and somewhat handsome to some but everyone has their opinions so please be at least okay looking? lol.. not trying to be shallow but friendship has to have some kind of attraction to the eyes.

I recently lost touch with two of my best friends which are females b/c they moved to another state. Just trying to find that friendly connection where I can build that type of friendship again.

**Hello, 
My name is Ryan. This note, this message to you is written from a new juncture in my life, a juncture that requires that I require more of myself. It is not lost on me, the understanding that working, whether it is for oneself or as part of an organization, what is most commonly referred to as ""work"" is a requirement to sustain life and flourish in this societal structure. My point of focus in this commentary is the feeling of not wanting to be just another member of the ""rat-race"" for the sake of working alone, especially when that work calls into question my integrity or moral compass. I am of the opinion that there should be meaning and the ability to make a measurable positive impact, a real contribution. The scale is not as significant as being able to look back at the end of a day, at the end of a week and at the end of my tenure and say and feel that I have been a part of a great team and great organization and we have had a positive impact. My interaction, my contribution, my energy and effort left someone or some organization better off than when we started. I also yearn for an organization that has a track record of merit based forward progression in terms of increased responsibility, diversity of opportunity and upward mobility within the organization. An organization that breeds into the environment a culture and understanding that says that an individuals' energy, resources and creative intellectual property will be recognized and acknowledged with compensation that is commensurate to their contribution to the organization there by providing access to a level of personal security that will allow me to remove all distraction and put my entire self into the task at hand. I would like to and it is my hope that I will find this amalgamation of energy out there in an organization. 

If you are the organization I describe here, it would be an honor to speak with you. Please contact me directly. 

If you have any positive feedback, advice, ideas and resources that would point me in the right direction, please contact me direct. 

For those in tune with and aware of the ""alternative"", a few facts... I am currently 32 as of this January 19. On the Zodiac spectrum, I am Capricorn Decan 3. On the Chinese Zodiacal spectrum, I am year of the Rat. On the Numerological spectrum, I am Life Path Six. One more for the road, my blood type is AB+.

I am also a still photographer using my own professional equipment (ig: @lifeisaphoto19, fb: photography by ryan r gilbert). I am available to shoot on-location or I have the option of a small in-home studio with available backdrops, lighting and camera/tripod combo to acheive a high quality finish. I welcome any ideas for personal photography projects (modeling and on-location corporate head shots, complete model portfolio sessions, tattoo photography, artistic b/w boudoir, adult entertainment promo photography, pet photography, legacy photography and much more), event photography and any other generally positive opportunities including drum circles and full moon gatherings.

**I posted what is seemingly (and it is) a job posting ad, in the personals section because I would like to use it to draw like minded and like energy individuals to myself. I have been in the DMV area now about a month and I would love to meet some cool people to replace crew back in Miami. Im open to text email or talk and eventually meet some kindreds out there.

I've been waiting for a special woman who wants to have an illicit affair in my NW Washington DC office. One who will let her desires lead the way. I keep imagining her walking into my office, closing the door, we kiss and I begin to caress her wanting body. I know I will enjoy her soft breasts and can't wait to feel her nipples tighten with gentle nibbles. My only intention is to touch her in ways that are stimulating and pleasing to her. Of course when she feels my mouth, tongue and hands teasing and enjoying her nipples her hand will take mine and will slip it between her burning thighs. I can feel my kisses moving lower until I am able to tease pleasure from her with my tongue. My one desire is to fulfil her desires and hear her moans of pleasure. My pleasure is her pleasure and is all I'll receive in return for my efforts. After she reaches her orgasm I'll help her dress and soothe her trembling body with soft kisses and touches and whisper how beautiful she is as she sets out to begin the rest of her day. No one but she and I will ever know why she smiles.

This is a real advert, today is Thursday and very very cold outside!

Im looking for others who understand the thrill and obsession about cheating and not getting caught!

Im married and yes it is horrible that I cheat but I'm starting to think its a weird fetish or thrill aspect of my life. For the most part, its not even about the sexual act itself but the planning of it and meeting a stranger in a planned place and the anticipation of touching that stranger for a brief moment knowing she is also cheating and having to ""hurry up"" before the phone calls come again.

The thrill of meeting in a public place and acting like a real couple - kissing, hand holding etc Nothing to wild in public, the point is nobody else knows that we are not a real couple. For me, it has now crossed over into an addiction where I enjoy seeing other married women for a brief moment, not even having sex most of the time---just passionate kissing, grouping and maybe petting/rubbing and then we both go our separate ways . . . .

How is for you ladies out there who have done this also? Is it more of a thrill or addiction for you as well?

Thanks for listening and NOT judging

Good evening ladies,

I'll try to keep this light. I'm 9 years deep into an unfulfilled marriage. We southerners married young, thinking our flaming hot desire would be all we needed to weather life. But when is that deep, understanding love supposed to set in? The passion has cooled, but I'm still a passionate man.

We're not separating. We have roots together, and beyond the chemistry we understand each other. I know my life is better with her than on my own. I'm missing something, though; there is a disconnect. 

I'm looking for a sympathetic ear. Some one who can listen without already knowing the answer. My ideal is that we can help each other. I can show you what the man sees and thinks, and you help me with her. If you're a super-hero relationship guru, I'll take that, too. But I'd like to connect with someone who has been there or is also in this funk.

I'm cool with this going online, or in person. Text is good for organizing thoughts, in person gives rich non-verbal cues. Tell me how you like it.

About me: I'm 30 years old, masters in engineering, new to NOVA. (I hope I'm using that right.) Conservative family, but very social and accepting. I find stress relief through exercise, but I'm certainly not a marathon runner, muscleman, or ninja. 

Thank you and goodnight!

I'm a semi-literate ass-clown who believes that making offensive remarks about women will make them like me. I also hold the belief that posting pictures of my genitalia in free ads on CL will result in a sexual encounter with an attractive woman. And while nothing has happened yet to suggest that my beliefs are accurate, I will continue making offensive remarks and posting pictures online. My energy, like my ignorance, is boundless.

Bullying appears popular nowadays so I may graft bullying on to my patchwork personae. Maybe a the rejection of science and an embrace of literal interpretations of ancient literature may have places too.

Now I must be on my way. I have to get back to typing one misspelled word replies to ads I believe have been posted online by attractive women.

I am a credit to manhood.

She was involved in a automobile accident a few months ago, and has since been stuck in the house. She has expressed to me she misses having some to talk to. (She recently also cut off many ""friends"" because she simply out grew them). So what I'm looking for is a chill laid back female, who is willing to talk with and hangout with from time to time. I do work a shift where I'm away most of the day, so preferably a house wife or someone home during the day is best. So send me a quick blurb as to why you would be an awesome friend to her.

Haven't been out in a while and looking to go to a lounge Friday night or Saturday and have drinks. Preferably in the VA area not trying to drive to far or we can meet up and uber somewhere.

I enjoy events/comedy shows, lounges, happy hours, movies, dinners, spa day, shopping, im really pretty open. I'm single and my work schedule allows me the leisure to make my own schedule.

Trying to meet someone on CL has become like finding a needle in a haystack. It shouldn't be so difficult.

I think I have many of the traits that women look for here. I'm honest and sincere; passionate, loving, and caring; kind, friendly, and loyal; independent, intelligent, and attractive; a non-smoker, very light drinker, and D/D free; with a good sense of humor. That all sounds good, right???

However, when I respond to ads, I often get lost in the mass replies that ladies receive. Sometimes, I resend my replies a few days later asking if there is any interest, and I hear that they never saw my first reply.

So many people are scared. Many others are playing games. Add in the lies, deceptions, SPAM, and SCAMs, and it is so hard today to make a connection.....like trying to find a needle in a haystack.

If you are my needle I would love to find you. I want to find a lady that is looking for friendship, someone to do activities with, enjoys the outdoors, likes to cuddle, and would like a little romance when the time is right. Someone that can enjoy the moment, and doesn't have an agenda or is looking for someone to take care of them. Someone that is able to take it as it goes, has faith in us to build a friendship and/or a relationship, without self-imposed pressures.

Tell me a little about yourself so we can get started. Any age, race, religion, personal situation, etc. is welcome to reply. None of it matters to form a friendship, and we'll see where it goes from there. I don't need to see your pic because I care more about who you are rather than what you look like; however, if you want me to send you a pic, I expect you to send me yours first. Please put your favorite dessert in the subject line. If we meet someplace that has it on the menu, I'll buy you a serving of it. Thanks!

Please don't reply if you aren't real or serious, or want to exchange endless emails. I'm very serious about meeting to get to know you in person, and I want nothing to do with joining websites or paying for memberships.

Since it's awkward to actually ask random girls (without getting slapped!) I figured I'd try asking here instead.

I am separated from my wife with NO possibility of reconciliation. I have a 20 year step son away in college and a 10 year old daughter who I love dearly. I should be getting a divorce later this year.

I work from home in software development and since I work from home do not have a lot of direct contact with ladies during the day and that is why I have posted this ad on Craigslist.

I am smart, honest and hardworking although I am a little shy.

I am white although your race is not important to me.

I'm 6' 00"", 200 lbs. clean, respectful, and know how to treat a lady.

Please introduce yourself and give me a couple of ideas to pique my interest! 

Have a great day!

Just finished a session with my therapist and I don't think it is helping. She suggests I just take a break and concentrate on working on some minor personal issues I have that I tend to overlook. What I really need is friend that can be attached or unattached to talk to and have lunches, happy hours, or dinners. My ideal match would be someone that is liberal, outgoing, uninhibited, engaging, pride in their health and appearance and just plain fun. Is this you?

Maybe this is a weird thing to look for but I'm hoping to find someone that would be interested in being a pseudo personal trainer - you'd workout with me some (and pick the workout) and other times assign me workouts and fitness related activities. You'll discourage me from slacking or procrastinating on workouts by assigning extra if I do or figuring out other consequences if I do. 

You: Female (I find I work better with female trainers and I also find women tend to be better at creating structure), very physically fit and athletic yourself (maybe you played a varsity sport, maybe you are into crossfit or triathlons or just generally being a badass). You have some interest in fitness, health and diet and enjoy pushing someone. 

Me: healthy, hwp, fit 30 year old man looking to take it to a whole new level. I currently workout about 3-4 times a week but have mediocre eating habits and lack consistency on both exercise and diet. 

If you are into fitness and like the idea of training someone and getting paid while you workout, you should write me.

I am a 52 year old Caucasian man from the northern plains coming to Manassas for continuing education related to my profession in a couple of weeks.

Although my days are filled with classroom activities, my evenings are filled with....nothing!

Even though I've travelled the United States many times over, Northern Virginia is an area that I've never been to. Since I don't know the area , I'm hoping to find someone that does and can possibly introduce me to a nice restaurant or lounge that I might not find otherwise. I would be honored to have the company of a mature woman, (over 40) for some nice conversation, a glass of wine, and dinner. 

I am 6' 00"", 200 lb, average build. I'm well educated, have a great sense of humor, and love to just kick back and have good fun. I'm a blue collar guy that works in a white collar world. . ..I'm equally comfortable in a symphony hall as I am a pool hall. I consider myself to be confident, but certainly not arrogant. I'm well mannered, well groomed, and now how to treat a woman like a lady.

I look forward to hearing from you...my treat, of course!

I wanted to make sure I mentioned from the beginning that I'm looking for something platonic. 

Working from home is great. No commute, freedom of schedule, wearing whatever you want to work. But it certainly doesn't lend itself to social interaction. I have always been a social person and I miss being able to go out to lunch with coworkers and having a friend to talk to.

I also miss having coworkers to go to the gym with. I don't necessary need someone to do a workout routine with, but just knowing that someone else was expecting me at the gym helped motivate me not to miss on days when I'm not feeling up to it.

If you find yourself wanting to find a friend or if you need a workout partner, then maybe we can fill in that missing piece for one another. Let's chat and see if we get along. Have a great Tuesday.

My name is Michael. I'm the introvert type who could use a friend(s) around his age. Only had 3 or 4 ""friends"" in High School and i don't speak to any of them anymore, don't even know how i could contact any of them. The only people I interact with on a daily basis are family and coworkers. So I've decided to start fresh.

I'm a 20 yr old African American. 5' 9"" with slight muscular build (due to my job, I don't workout). 
Obviously the shy and quiet type. More a listener than a talker (So if you love to talk and get minimal response, we're perfect.) 
When I do talk I'm very imaginative, borderline insane but still functional. Good sense of humor (Unfortunately I sometimes find other people misfortune hilarious, even when I shouldn't. You've been warned).
I read a lot. 
I'm a gamer. 
I don't socialize online that often but I would like to change that a bit. 
I love nature and random walks, so long as it isn't cold. 
I don't go out that often (as in never, unless it's work, school, or errands) so I'm hoping as my friend, you can help me fix that. 
I'm definitely not into politics but will listen to you if you are, just seriously don't expect my opinion on the matter.
I'm Christian, but not a very good one, I honestly can't tell you the last time I stepped foot in a church).
In addition to that, I'm pretty liberal with other views (You could be a satanist and let that be super obvious in our conversations, and I still wouldn't mind so long as we have some kind of common ground).

Essentially what I'm looking for in a friend is someone that can accept me for me. You're free to want to change me a bit or view me as a challenge BUT if I say I'm not changing a specific aspect of myself, I ask that you respect that and leave it be.

Let's start with texting buddies and then if we feel we can stand to be around each other, move to in person outings. Reach me at twozero2 four4six eight4five4. Let's be friends.

Hi,

I am looking for someone who needs/enjoy giving massage. 

A little bit about me. I am a PhDstudent (male- 29 & straight). I am supposed to take regular massage. But it is bit expensive although I feel good once I take it.I am just thinking if someone is in similar situation. I am respectful, and should not cross the boundary of your defined privacy. At the same time I am not that shy. I can show you how to do it and you can apply over me. You don't need to be expert on this. Similarly, I can follow what you want. 

Race or age is not important. If you are old or young, that's not my concern. I just wish to get rid off my pain. If you enjoy giving it or having it I have no issue. 

If you are in college/school and need someone to help in science, math or GRE/SAT, I can help you on exchange of that.

If you have skin diseases or any transmittable disease please don't contact. Knowingly transmitting disease or not acknowledging it might end up in legal issues. I am careful about CL people and know how to deal with it. I will prefer someone educated, legitimate and sane person without police record.

This is sad but I need a show. I don't really watch tv. I do now though. I like the birthday boys. It's a show. Anyway I need a comedy. But I don't want to waste my time. Which is why I should not be on Netflix. I should be finding a job. Sigh. Help. Don't waste my time with a bad show.

Looking to make a new friend! It's fairly unlikely we'll meet, due to a couple reasons, but that's not 100% set in stone. 
Basically I just want someone I can get along with and chat with. Not looking for a relationship or a fling or anything like that. Platonic. Casual friends, texting (after a bit) if you're comfortable with that, or sticking to emails, whichever.

Here's some stuff about me:
-I work on a farm, I'm a very outdoorsy person during the warm months. Big wimp about the cold, though. 
-favorite TV shows: Supernatural, NCIS, Sherlock, Game of Thrones, Star Trek: TNG.
-favorite movies: Star Wars (4-6, liked 7, not 1-3), anything Monty Python, Jurassic Park (1), Jurassic World, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Princess Bride, Dirty Dancing.
-former theatre kid, and I still volunteer with a community theatre group in the summer. 
-favorite video games: Diablo 3, Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow (yep on my Game Boy Color), Mario Kart 64 (though I no longer have the means to hook it up to a TV). Slowly getting into WoW for the first time, but I don't think that'll last too much longer. 
-favorite authors: Dean Koontz and Stephen King

About you:
- 18-35-ish? Just so we're in similar parts of our lives. 
-Didn't judge me too harshly for all the dorkiness listed above. I understand I can be a bit of a nerd, and I'm okay with that.
-can hold a conversation about at least a couple of the things listed above, or similar
-that's about all I ""require."" Beyond that, if you think we'd get along then shoot me an email.

It's about 10:45 at night and I might not be up tooooo much longer but I'll be responding to emails in the morning/afternoon tomorrow. Feel free to tell me whatever you'd like about yourself, especially if we have some of the same interests :)

Just being bold & honest here (hopefully not too honest). I'm a licensed massage therapist of 10 years who absolutely loves his work. My energy is nurturing, healing and genuine. A great Connection/Chemistry is important to me and so I'm not just looking for anyone and everyone. Let's meet first and make sure the other is sane before we consider setting up anything.

My expectation is nothing more than to find someone who loves massages where the physical attractionn & energy is mutual between giver and receiver. It doesn't have to lead to ""hooking up"", that's not why I'm here. Seeing bodies all the time is normal to me, so one body to me is the same as the next. It is pleasant though to share the gift I have been given, to someone I want to touch instead of having to because they are paying me.

If something develops into a friendship then that would be great as well. I live a healthy lifestyle. Physically fit & eat fairly well.

I would actually love finding another submissive to be pen pal friends with, but you don't really have to be submissive. I just thought that might be nice to compare notes about what our desires, and needs are all about.

I'm definitely a submissive...and, emotional/mental/physical masochist.

I'm wanting just a pen pal, because I would probably be too shy, and to ashamed, to meet after sharing all the pathetic things you'll learn about me as a pen pal. I really don't know how I've ended up being such a ""pussy boy"", but that's just what I am. I would just really like having a nice woman to share things with.

I'm not a huge drinker but I like going out for a beer ( or three ) after work to relax and reconnect as a person ( or to validate I'm human) after spending too much time at my desk staring at the computer here in my office at work. I'm literate (semi if we're talking serious literature). Oh, and drinks are on me!. About me, I'm married but posting in platonic. Age. Young 50s. Thank you!

Do other practitioners have ideas for motivating people for change?

I meditate, practice yoga, walk, go to the gym, eat nutritiously and live what I teach. 

I believe the body has great potential for healing. I use Reiki and acupressure on myself and others. Three are great benefits with practices that do not involve medication.

I'm 50-year-old single Asian woman with no kids. My work brought me to DC three years ago. I'm kind, honest, fun-loving, well-educated, have a curious mind, and cherish friendship. 

I like to hike, jog, read, travel, go to movies, play ping-pong and learn new skills. I lament the good old days at college where you could find good friends without worrying about their true intension and the friendship could be pure and long-lasting. I usually get along with guys. 

At this point of life, I'm hoping to find true male friends who are intelligent, generous, sharing, honest, humorous, have a big heart, non-smoker, drink only socially, can share ups and downs in life, and can offer some good advice in how to be a better person. 

I'm not interested in guys who are married or are just looking for a fling. 

I'd like to be friends with whom are a professional, well groomed, fit, healthy, honest, enjoying hiking, knowledgeable and decent, at the age between 47 ~60, lives in the DMV area. I don't believe in platonic relationship between men and women. If you are currently involved or in a serious relationship, please be true to that person.

When answering this ad, please describe where you live; tell me what qualities you value the most as a good friend. If you wish, you can include your email address or one or two recent photos.

I'm not talking about that multi-spice or the marks you put on top of words, I'm talking about your voice! I find good looking women with an accent endearing.

Hi...

So, just to get it out of the way... I'm married. Not gonna change that now. Ok. That's done :).

I'm also 44, in good shape, good looking, sane, nice guy. But things aren't what I expected in the marriage. Happy to discuss if/when we get there. But I know there are women out there with the same feelings. 

What is missing? A spark. Chemistry. Butterflies. Anticipation. Again, I'm sure you know the feeling.

What am I looking for? A woman in a similar situation. Married or willing not to push me to change. Who is missing that spark. Will it go beyond pure platonic? Not sure. I know I want to... But let's start by emailing. If we're both adults and honest, it'll progress.

Email me. Let me know your situation. A pic would be nice. :)

Hello,

The warm weather is finally here. I'm hoping to expand and search for other hobbies. I'm looking for an older or young brothers, who is lay back, that I can hang out with. I know Craigslist is not the best place to look but I don't want to get any apps. 
I have a lot of female friends but sometime I don't like to do what they like to do or even talk about the subject that come up. For example shopping, talks about fashion, reality TV, annoying break up story, and the behind talk about other girls. 
Don't get me wrong now, women are amazing but sometime they get annoying, Ha Ha! Well, men do it too but I guess I have someone to back me up and get to be in the conversation and not having to be the neutral guy. 

**Please keep this platonic, I don't want to later find out that you are looking for a hook up but you were disappointed. If you need a hug, we can hug but lets not get too weird about it. 

About me:
I'm funny, lay back, creative, nice, and understanding. I don't drink or do drugs. An artist and volunteer. I live around Arlington, Falls Church, and Alexandria. It would be easy for us to hang out if we are close. 

Looking for:
A lay back older or younger brother. I don't want a daddy. I'm 26, so you decide if you are a brother. 

Looking forward:
Hanging out, exercise, outdoor adventures, sports.

If you are being real, please send me a face picture, some stats, something about you, and what you like to do. If you send me nude photo, body picture, less than ten words email, I can't do much but delete. 

If you don't like to hang out with Asian, please don't email me.

Please be sure you understand that I'm a happily married man before reading on. I know this is the platonic section, but there are still a lot of non-platonic posts in here.

I found myself today, during a slow stretch at work, browsing my facebook history and reading some of the past activities and messages from friends before I was married. I used to have a good number of female friends in my single days, but, for one reason or another, those friendships faded once I met my wife. 

I know this is natural, but it made me realize how much I miss having female friends in my life...having a female perspective to bounce ideas off of, someone who might enjoy or reciprocate occasional, subtle flirtation in the presence of mutual attraction and just a friend who I can look forward to chatting with and joking around with during the week.

Being that I work from home, I don't really have an opportunity to meet anyone new for a potential friendship, so I'm forced to turn to the internet. 

I'm hoping to meet another married woman who also misses having guy friends to chat with. I'd like to meet someone within 8-10 years of my own age (33) who would enjoy exchanging emails or some form of texts during the day and, when convenient, in the evening. Having a sense of humor is a plus, for sure, as I don't like to take myself too seriously and enjoy a good, witty back and forth. It would also be nice if you are relatively active and fit, as I would enjoy having a work out partner if our locations and schedules align. 

Hope to hear from you!

I'm making an impromptu decision today to skip work tomorrow and head into Clarendon for some day drinking and NCAA basketball.

There's a chance that I might be coming in solo, as my friend can't get off from work. So, in order to salvage the day and still enjoy St. Patrick's day to the fullest, I wanted to post to see if anyone else found themselves in my exact predicament and wanted to team up for a fun filled afternoon of day drinking and people watching.

I'm 32, tall, fit, with brown hair and blue eyes. 

Email me and let's see if our paths will cross at any point tomorrow. Be sure you're wearing green!

So, here goes. I am a MM in NoVa. Married for a long time and plan to stay that way. (those of you who are judgmental can stop reading now).That said, like most long term marriages, there is the strong sense of ennui. that feeling that there is nothing new to talk about, nothing to experience, and so on. My guess is I am not alone. So, if you are in the same situation, not wanting to cheat, but interested in ongoing email exchange with an older gentleman, then perhaps we are a match. I prefer we don't talk about politics, religion or race. Those things turn light conversations into something emotional, friends into foes, and so on. I definitely don't need that! But, everything else is fair game. Want to share lifestories, talk about how your day is going, or maybe rag on your significant other (LOL)? Great, I'm your guy. 

Please be attached and over 40. That way we will have something in common. I really want this to be stress free and a momentary escape from the daily grind. If you are indeed interested, get back to me. I promise you non-judgmental, adult, friendly conversation.

I will be in North Virginia on and off for the next few months, and I am looking for some company. Now, do note this is in the ""Strictly Platonic"" section...not looking for a hookup, pay-for-play, or a LTR. I live in Texas, and I have no plans of moving from there.

That said, I will be here for work. My schedule will be busy, but it would be nice if a night or two I could have some company. Ideally, someone to meet for dinner, maybe catch some music or a movie...a little downtime with someone who is open to good company for an evening with no strings/expectations.

Ideally, you are between the ages of 50 - 65, educated (or at least intelligent), moderate-to-left leaning, and have a great sense of humor. Patience is a must, because I am only going to be in the area when my company sends me (which should be twice a month, for a week a stretch) and I'll only be available when my work allows. Race/looks do not matter, but personality is key. Be relaxed, interesting and easy-going, and we will get along fine.

Please respond with a little about yourself and what you enjoy doing. And, if you know of a great Italian place (for dinner), you go to the TOP of the list. Love Italian food!!! Please change the title line to your favorite color, and I'll respond to you. Otherwise, I will think you are a canned-meat-product and treat your message as such....

Hi There,

If you are reading this ad then it means probably you are in a similar situation. You are married and bored with your current situation, BUT you are not looking to end your marriage as too much is involved.

You still love your spouse (but more as a friend), and you just want to put a spark back in your life. Your probably not sure on what is needed to get the spark, but you're in search of it. Is it an email/chat buddy? coffee/Lunch buddy? Happy hour or more buddy?

That's my situation and I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for..other than a spark. If you are in the same boat email me and lets see what we can discover. I can send you pic for pic.

Physically I am attractive and in great shape. Professional, 47yrs, Sandy Blond Hair and Blue Eyes, 6'1"", 203 lbs, funny with a really good sense of humor.

You: please be married, attractive (I know, looks aren't everything, but we must click both mentally and physically), and a good sense of humor :-)

I look forward to chatting and will trade pic for pic. :-)

It's almost 9pm on a Saturday night and there's nothing to do. Most of the other twenty-somethings and thirty-somethings are going out to the bars and clubs. You could go too; perhaps your friends have invited you to go out with them; but it's really not your thing. What you wish most of all was that the library was open. A really nice library, with cozy chairs, hardwood floors, area rugs, and real wooden bookshelves. But at this time of night, all of the libraries are closed and locked. Apparently nobody likes to read a Saturday night.

Still, you like to fantasize. You like to imagine yourself walking through the aisles, pausing ever so briefly each time one of your familiar favorites catches your eye: Austen, Bronte, Dickens, Dickinson, Faulkner, Hemingway, Hugo, Joyce. . . Just seeing the names brings a smile to your face as you recall the pleasures that their words have given you over the years. You've already read almost everything by the great ones, but there is always something more. Another treat to savor. Those last few Shakespeare plays you've never read. Or one of Vladimir Nabokov's more obscure novels from his Russian period. Or Finnegans Wake. No, not Finnegans Wake. You need something that will satisfy tonight, not next year. How about an Emily Dickinson poem? Yes.

You pull a book off the shelf, open to a random page, and continue slowly walking down the aisle as you read the words

Master--open
your life wide, and
take me in forever,
I will never be tired--
I will never be noisy
when you want to be
still--I will be
your best little
girl--

Suddenly, not looking where you are going, you walk right smack into a man. A tall man in a corduroy blazer and dark rimmed glasses. A man who is probably at least ten years older than you, if not more. A man who is surprisingly fit and attractive in a college professor sort of way. Where did he come from? This is your library. Your dream. Your imagination. You thought you were alone. Embarrassed and flustered, you apologize and quickly turn around to head in the other direction.

""The library is closed. What are you doing here? How did you get in here?"" His voice is deep and smooth. Strong. And as he speaks, he places a firm hand on your shoulder.

""What are you reading?"" he asks as he steps closer and places his other hand on your other shoulder. You wonder what kind of dream this is. You can feel his eyes as they read the words on the page

nobody else will see me, but you--
but that is enough--
I shall not want any more--

His big hands begin to slide down your arms, and you can feel your breath quickening. You notice a simple gold band on his finger, and your eyes fixate on it as he takes the book from you, closes it, and places it on the shelf.

You turn around to face him, and you raise your head until the two of you are looking directly into each other's eyes. An academic man and a young scholar. A common love for literature. A quiet place to share each other's interests.

Perhaps we should continue the discussion in a real library?

I am going through a very difficult time in my life, things are really bad. It all started with a tragic personal loss, no nobody died....but it was a heartbreaking loss nonetheless. It led to a stretch where I honestly couldn't even get myself out of bed or get myself to do or care about anything at all. That obviously funneled its way down to so many other aspects of my life and they obviously were effected in very negative ways. To put it simply, I lost the love of my life and everything else pretty much went to shit along with it. I don't have the money to go see a therapist or shrink, not that I even think that would help. I'm not in a depression, cause I can still laugh and have a good time, I just dread anytime of day or any single moment where I have the quiet time to think about my circumstances. I know I need to keep myself busy, yet at the same time I can't bring myself to do anything at all, talk about counterproductive right. there is just this overlaying cloud of melancholy that is hovering over me and it sucks and I thought that maybe there is someone out there going through something similar. Maybe we can support each other through it all, I don't know....I don't even know if CL is what it once was, maybe it's nothing but bots and psychos and scammers, but maybe, just maybe there is someone out there that can relate and that wants to meet someone who is going through something similar. If there is, get back too me and we can go from there. If not, well best of luck to all of you and hopefully I figure out what in the world I need to do.

OK, so not entirely platonic but looking for a real FWB. Masculine discreet guy looking for a masculine straight or bi guy for some safe m2m fun. Have a GF and need to keep this between us. Would be great to have a bud for fun in and out of the bedroom, but know that may be tough so not a requirement. GL, fit, DDF/Neg, safe and looking for the same. Looking for my age or younger. Send stats at least in the first email.

I'm just gonna put it out there....I'm attached yes...I have a family and a home I care deeply about. I'm attractive, educated, funny and extremely down to earth. 

My friends are far and few between....I love all things natural (hair especially ) I don't smoke, I drink sparingly and I'm very conscious about what I put in my body. 

I'm looking for a BFF on the same frequency...a lover of the arts, good music, good laughs, good food, good exercise...I've been with women fyi and if you have too then great we have something else in common. If there's an attraction cool but just know I'm discreet with mines and I prefer you are as well. 

If you've never been with women that's fine too...I'm not concerned about your orientation (though it could be a bonus) but I'm really here for a new friendship over all.

Please be real and not a troll or poser (that's super whack, don't be THAT person), fem (born female), in your 30's, into the same things I am or more (I love to learn new things)...chill, down to earth, in the local area, mobile, got your own everything, can hang and or travel from time to time...my Nubian Queen's to the front of the line please (but I'm open to ALL women of color).

Let's chat, get to know each other and go from there. Hopefully this can be a life long friendship. 

Hope to meet my new BFF/BFWB soon!

This post may be borderline ""strictly platonic"" but I'm trying it anyway.

I'd love to meet a woman, talk a little, get to know each other a little and then I'd really love to use my mouth on her.
I'm not talking about anything strictly sexual...I just love feeling a woman skin on my lips.
I love hugging, feeling our body so close and kissing your neck, gently, slowly going down on your shoulders and back. I just love it.
I love using my mouth, my lips and tongue on every inch of a woman's body.
It's an immense pleasure watching a woman shaking and moaning while I explore her body!
You don't have to do anything other than relax and let me enjoy you....that's how much I love it!

Can you be that woman?
In case it's important...I'm a white male, 37yo.
I don't care about your age, body or status, I can be extremely discreet.

WE are a COUPLE! Seeking a woman whom is interested in exploring some fun experiences with US TOGETHER... 

Looking to have my first experience with a female AND in a threeplay with the right female playmate... We are seeking chemistry, connection, and a female whom will be comfortable with US!

Seeking these qualities for this with a female:

Non-Smoker
Social Drinking acceptable
No Drug Use
DD Free
Athletic and/or physically fit
Clean and takes care of appearance
Caucasian preferred, however females are considered if both of us agree to engagement...

Mutual chemistry, connection and attraction are important with engagement...

If chosen, YOU will be my first in this to fulfill my fantasy in double... It is important that all things fall into place and have a great time in the making :) ... You should be adventurous as we are looking for a third for preferably ongoing experiences...

About him... a lethal combination of tall, handsome, and sexy...
About her... a ginger with personality, beauty, and sexy to boot...

Both of us are Professional, very Good Looking, Athletic, DD Free, Non-smokers, Drinks Socially, and DO NOT Use/Do Drugs...

Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement... 

PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING WHEN RESPONDING: We expect to email, chat, exchange pics and speak on the phone prior to meeting... (photo and general information will be inquired to get to know you personally)...

SERIOUS INTEREST and INQUIRIES ONLY!!!... NO MALES... NO DRAMA.... NO DISINGENUOUS REPLIES!!!

FURTHERMORE: Not looking to engage in convo that leads to a dead end, meaning that no progression is made so we can see were this might lead! Meeting socially to see if we have connection/chemistry with casual conversation, interaction and if we do we can go from there. If we do connect, great! If we don't, we can part ways respectfully... 

This could lead to an ongoing friendship and possibly more, but if it only ends up in one or more fun evenings out, that would be great too...

IN RECAP: Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement (photo and some general information will be requested to get to know you personally)...

SERIOUS INTEREST AND INQUIRIES ONLY!... NO MALES. NO DRAMA....

So if you are interested in being a playmate or even possibly part of a triad let us know. Please put ""Respectfully Yours"" in the subject line, include pics, experience, desires and expectations... Please feel free to reply to this email or Kik us if interested: my handle is VenusVegas...

I'm hoping to find someone to keep me company at the pool, swim some laps together, and flirt a bit in the hot tub afterward. I'm 45, a good swimmer, slim and fit, and I'm fairly diligent about going to the pool at least once a week; but it would be much more fun to go with someone else--especially if you're sweet, friendly, and you look cute in a swimsuit. I used to have a swimming buddy, but she changed jobs and it isn't convenient for her anymore; so I've been going by myself lately, and it's not nearly as much fun. I have a flexible schedule and can usually make time throughout the day or evening with enough notice, and most of the Fairfax County indoor pools are convenient for me. If you're interested, let me know, and we'll figure out where and when. I don't mind if you're married or otherwise attached, as long as you don't mind the same about me. What happens at the pool stays at the pool :)

If you reply, please mention something about your appreciation of swimming so I don't accidentally flag you as spam.

I would really love it today if a sensible woman would extend me the courtesy of just an hour or two of cuddling and talking. I would really love some affection today! i crave it ( nothing sexual)

I am a professional with post grad education and a good life. I am caucasian, 6' tall, 185 lbs ( for now). Respectful, full of life and could be a great friend.

I hate waking up so incredibly frustrated. I am still job hunting and so stressed and worried. I am six weeks from graduating with my second college degree in social work (bachelors). I can't find a job to save my life. Occasionally I get an interview but I am always beat out by someone else with more experience it seems. There isn't much I can't do. I have the two degrees and I am currently applying to grad school but I NEED TO BE WORKING STEADILY. I went back to school later in life and I worked my ass off and I have a ton of student debt to show for it, but where is the good paying job to show for all this hard work and effort? 

Thankfully I can bartend and I tend to find bartending gigs here and there to stay somewhat afloat but even that is getting harder to find. THREE interviews last week alone. They increasingly want 20 somethings at these places. If anyone has a lead on a bartending job I would appreciate that too. 

Also, I was thinking of printing out some resumes and a brief profile and just handing them out on the street. Anyone that is familiar enough with the area know where I might be best suited to doing this? Is there an area that might increase my odds that someone working for a nonprofit will get my resume? 

Any help, advice, leads, anything is appreciated. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. There is no help available and I am becoming increasingly stressed and depressed by the day. It's hard to keep your head up when rejection is all that's on the menu. 

Thanks for listening.

Care to grab a bite/drink with someone new? Maybe check out some live music/museum or such? 

About me:
- Asian American
- Well-traveled but locally educated (University of Maryland alum)

Happy St. Paddy's Day

I enjoy film, music, staying fit, cooking, enjoying a smoke. I work M-F, have weekends off, love to come home and relax, cook, enjoy a drink, watch movies, work out. Age is not important to me, but friendly disposition and a good heart definitely are. You are easy-going, nonjudgmental, tend to have a goofy sense of humor. Let's chat, meet up for a cup of coffee and see if we get along enough to watch lots of movies. Maybe we'll both make a new friend.

A different title for a different kind of ad. I am looking to chat with a woman he continues to read one of the many ads from these Christian Grey wannabes. You have thought about exploring the pleasures of submission. You are drawn to the idea, but something is holding you back. I am a Dom. I have a sub. I'm not necessarily looking to meet, but something more is not out of the question. I just want to get a better sense of what is in the mind of someone at this stage. I'm happy to share my insights as you think about exploring and give tips and pointers along the way. We can keep it online or meet for coffee or something at somepoint.

Hello,

I am 28, MWM, who is looking for someone to chat with during the day. I work a lot, but often have downtime as well. I would love to find someone interesting and new to talk to. Just be nice and able to carry a conversation. I like to joke, flirt, and make fun of life. 

I enjoy a lot of things, and can talk pretty much about anything. I am pretty liberal. I would love to hear about what you like, what your interests are. Anything you want to know about me, just ask.

Not looking to change anyone's life, just friendly conversation. No creeps.

It is a really erotic way to endure some pleasureful pain. That is what I am into and what turns me on. Ask me more if you want to know. Looking for skinny (or fit), smooth twink boys with abs for now.

I am looking for skinny/fit twink boys for gut-punching sessions at a place in Arlington (I work in Crystal City). I don't have much time, but if your in the area, I know a place we can go to for about 20-30 minutes or so. Ideal boy is skinny with a tight washboard stomach and naturally smooth body. Asian, Latino and Black boys are a plus. If your up for something freaky, HMU. These are my fetishes: gut punching a boy to orgasm and tighty whitey briefs/speedos.

So I have some doubts as to whether this can actually work (although I am a positive happy person with an open mind). Let's just chalk this up to a social experiment and see what we get! I really am just looking for something platonic, someone to email and/or IM with to help break up the monotony of the day. If you're just looking for something completely physical then this is not the post for you. Please be honest, sincere, smart, witty and playful and have a positive view of the world! 

I'm looking for normal conversation on what will most likely be a wide variety of topics. Also, please be literate and able to type in complete sentences. A little bit about me. I'm 40, white, married, fit, handsome/clean cut, employed full time with a couple of graduate degrees. I can talk about lots of stuff, art, photography, music, television, travel, books, movies, sports, you name it! If you're bored and are looking for some intellectual stimulation, feel free to drop me a line. It would be great to have that exciting feeling of meeting a new friend with the respect and understanding that would ideally go with it.

Bonus points if you can provide an obscure 80s cartoon reference in the subject line :)

Just went thru a break up, been thru too many break ups with this guy... and also recently discovered that he's a cheater and a liar and a womanizer and a hypocrit who wanted me to have absolutely no guy friends, while he was cheating. So now I'm single and lonely since I lost friends for him early on when first dating. I dont want a relationship right now, and no fwb or any of that stuff either. I just need some supportive friends who i can talk to, who will be there for me as a friend. I want to see that there are good guys out there, and that my ex is wrong about all guys only wanting sex from girls and not caring to be just friends. He has a life aside from me, but if i so much as talk to another guy even when single, then im a hoe according to him. Sick of the double standards and mind games, and tired of having to keep all my anger at him to myself. Im thru with not having friends. As i said tho, i am looking for platonic friendship and nothing more. So if youre cool with that, hmu. If ur a perv, i wont bother replying... not trying to sound stuck up, im not stuck up at all, but i hate pervs.

I'm only five feet tall. Very athletic. I workout five to six days a week faithfully. Been alone for a couple of years by choice. Need that good friend for comfort and to just let me know everything is going to be alright. And in return, I will do the same for that Special Friend. I don't have any drama in my life. My life is very quiet. I'm well employed. Own home and vehicle. Everyone tells me all the time I have a pretty smile. I don't drink. I don't do any type of drugs. I don't smoke and don't care to be around anyone who does smoke. I'm really shy and quiet. I like the movies a lot. I have to play catch up. Been so busy with stuff. Need to take a break for a moment and catch up with myself. Race is not important to me. Age is not important to me but please be legal. This could really turn out to be a great and lasting relationship.

Ladies,

Are there certain sides to you or even things that you secretly like but are too shy, afraid or embarrassed to admit to the people you're close to because of the feeling that they'll misjudge you or start looking at you differently, think that you're weird because of what you like and/or don't like? Is there anything that you would like to do with someone or would want someone to do for you but in your mind you feel that whatever it is may creep them out or that they will immediately decline because of whatever the request or desire may entail? Feel that others will not ever truly understand and accept the real you so you keep the real you hidden within?

Well fear not... you are not alone. I'm just like you. I love meeting new people and will gladly share my interests, passions and desires with anyone who is willing to listen and accept me for who I am and what I like and/or dislike. I do not judge others for their quirks and I certainly try not to knock something before trying it. After all, you could end up liking or disliking it too and can therfore see things from another person's point of view.

With that said, ladies please feel free to send a reply. Don't be shy. Let's be friends and get to know the real us through one another. Share with me your personality, your lifestyle, your likes and your dislikes. I will gladly share with you the same. Who knows, maybe I might like and or dislike the same things that you do and vice versa. Let's chat!! :-)

I'm hoping to find someone who likes to write. The evidence suggests that I'm a fairly reliable correspondent, as I'm still in touch with penpals I've had since the '80s. Yes, I live in the Boston area, but I thought it might be fun to make the acquaintance of someone from DC.

I'm an enthusiastic urban walker, have never been in a fistfight, am often praised for my sense of humor, like to hang out in used bookstores, can carry a tune, have a vivid imagination, and know a thing or two about a thing or two. 

Will this lead to something else? Hard to say. Sometimes a correspondence is a prelude to another kind of relationship, sometimes the correspondence IS the relationship.

Hello,

I am 28, MWM, athletic, who is looking for someone to walk/jog with around the neighborhoods. I have recently recovered from a knee injury, and am now getting back into exercising after about a year off. I have gotten back into things pretty easily, but would love to have a partner. Someone to help push me, and nice to talk to. Ideally you would be someone who is starting over as well, or be willing to work with me. Please be able and willing to progress at a fair/nice pace. I would like us to push each other to do better, but no drill sergeants. I would like to keep this easy-going, especially until we feel each other out. Just walking/jogging for now. If we hit it off then we can expand on our training.

The main times I am open are Wednesday and Thursday evenings, some Fridays depending on plans. This relationship would be STRICTLY platonic, just workout buddies. The only reason this ad is not open to males is because CL is creepy. Your status/age/race does not matter to me, just be willing to work out and keep me company. Just be nice!

My promise to you is that I would be dedicated to the workout, and always be nice and respectful. No unwanted pressure, no egos.

Please be local to the Gainesville/Bristow area or close. Hope to hear from you. No creepers.

I realize this endeavor has about as much a chance of success as my getting a job at Hooters (these A-minuses I'm rocking are clearly not going to blow anyone's doors off. . .or anything else, for that matter), but, well, worth a shot, right? I mean, it IS Craigslist. . .there are weirdos on here. Like me.

So, what brings me into this den of interweb weirdos? There's no way to say this without sounding douchey, so I'll just say it douchily (that's a word, right?): I need a cuddle. And I'm married.

Yes, I should theoretically get all the cuddling I need at home. But, sadly, circumstances in life seem to be conspiring against that happening, and it's been a long time (years?) since cuddling for the sake of cuddling happened, without all of the attendant pressures and stresses of life intruding on the moment. And I miss that. I miss what it feels like to just get lost in the moment snuggling with someone, feeling them pressed against you, smelling the scent of their hair, just reveling in being close and connected. 

I know what you're thinking--""Hey, dirty old married guy. . .you really just want skeezy sex, but are trying to disguise it as something innocent."" That's what I'd be thinking, too, if I were you. I assure you I'm not, but this is CL, and there are weirdos (like me), so why would you believe me?
Hmm. This may be an insurmountable obstacle. Nonetheless, let's press forward. All of you who are no longer reading might be interested. Or not. Since you're no longer reading.

I'm a 36-year-old white professional with brown hair and blue eyes; 5'9""; 150 pounds; generally pretty good smelling. Pretty good at cuddling (by my own reckoning, at least. . .perhaps that doesn't qualify as a ringing third-party endorsement). And I really want to just get lost, if even for an hour, in being close to someone, snuggling with someone, spooning, holding, etc. Life has been incredibly stressful lately, and that sort of contact sounds so relaxing, so amazingly therapeutic. . .sigh.

I know there are services for this sort of thing, and I've inquired, but haven't had any luck finding anyone who's schedule is compatible or who's close enough to make it work. And, it seems weird to pay for that sort of thing (not that I'm opposed to it), as it feels much better when the other person is just as eager to hold and be held. 

So, what am I looking for? Someone who wants the same thing (I should say a lady who wants the same thing. . .sorry, gents; nothing personal). Someone who's ideally available during the day and can host our snuggling. Someone who has a good sense of humor and will look at this the same way I do: a therapeutic modality that will give us both an escape from the stress of life for a little bit, and a chance connect with someone. 

I realize there's exactly 0 people out there who will fit that description, but there's always hope, right? Let me sweeten the pot: I WILL BRING COOKIES! Or whatever baked good tickles your pickle boat (is that a thing?). How can you say no to THAT? 

We could always meet for coffee or something beforehand, too, just to see if we feel like we want to proceed. Snuggling is intimate, and it might be weird to just show up and say, ""Hey, nice to meet you, little spoon! Get over here!""

If that sounds remotely interesting, I'd love to hear from you. . .I shan't hold my breath, though, as I'm not very good at that anyway. ;)

(Oh, and for those wondering...I really just do mean cookies. Apparently, as I've learned somewhat awkwardly, that word can mean something else on CL...)

I am looking for a particular someone. Please read carefully. 

As of recently, I fell into one helluva financial ditch and I'm currently prepping for beast mode to fix it. Fast. 
I have a number of ideas but figure 2 heads are better than one. That's where you come in...

To save the both of us some time, I'm stating very clearly below on what type of person I'm looking for as my partner. 

You are:
-A girl who is mature in attitude/age and has some life experience. 
-Someone who is lowkey and fairly unknown. (As myself.) 
-Someone who at the moment, doesn't have any real commitments (kids, work etc) and are able to get up and go whenever the time is warranted. (Unless you have reliable means)
-Easy going
-About your money

2 things you MUST be:
*Attractive
You MUST be in shape, take care of your hygiene, hair should always be styled..you're a woman, need I say more? 
*A chameleon 
To roll w/me, you must be able to vibe w/any crowd. I mostly frequent spots w/wealthy white men. You have to know how to mingle. There's a time and place for everything, I get it, but from time to time, Ima need you to throw on your 'white girl' voice. (Lmao) 

So in short, I'm looking for a partner that's down to hit the road and stack paper together. Like real soon...

A bit about myself, I'm just a lowkey chill girl. No one really knows me. I move alone but just recently decided to link up w/a bad one. I'm very attractive and looking for my rider to be the same. Also, please be 4/20 friendly. It's not a deal breaker but it's better when we're both zoning (lol). 

We will talk more in detail via email. First, please send AT least 2 CLEAR photos of you that show your face and body (not nude, this ain't that kind of party, just wanna see your shape) RECENT photos only please.

Searching for another girl that is interested in joining a guy/girl friend. Ideally she would be more into girls and be comfy with her guy friend as he focusses on her and watches. The girl has experienced some with girls and liked it and she wants to eat out and get eaten out as she gets fucked my her guy friend. You must be super clean and mostly into women. The guy will not be interacting much if any with you. This is simply a non drama fun thing for the girl. I am searching now so we can get this going. Age does not matter, no drugs or STDs. Non Drama. We are mid 20s. If you want to considered, please send a pic and it doesn't have to be x rated and a little about yourself. She is somewhat shy but once she gets going, she is so much fun. Any questions, please ask.

Looking for casual friends to occasionally join me or meet me at a club downtown, mainly Town or Cobalt. Only looking for pals, preferably late 20s to late 40s. I don't drink,don't smoke, don't use drugs. Preferably you are the same but I don't necessarily count you out if you do as long as you have control over your situation. 


I love dance music like trance, anthem house, remixes, circuit, and others. Would love to hang and drive together and experience the pre-gaming on the way to the club which in my case are the pumping tunes we will sample together. 

If you live in Montgomery County or the Dc Metro region and you would be down to make a new platonic connection, shoot me a reply with a little about yourself. I'm slender,mostly smooth, 5'8"", about 150,very young looking early 30s. White guy. I dress kinda pretty boy, a little casual yet chic clubby style. 

Not looking for hookup. Maybe a little flirting wouldn't hurt. If we are in to it. Or with others. Really just looking for a sincere relatively stable clubbing buddy to enjoy an occasional late night out with.

Looking possibly to hang as soon as tonight or within the next couple weekends coming up. Send pics if you can but I'd prefer to be discrete until I get a little more info from you. Thanks!!

This is strictly for friendship! LESBIANS DO NOT REPLY. I am a 38 year old AA Female With No Kids. I am easy going, fun, friendly, and drama-free . I enjoy going out for coffee, eating out, walking, exercising, going to lounges, or clubs sometimes, and movies. I need a movie buddy! lol. I am looking for friends in the Woodbridge area. It would be an A plus if you don't have any kids, in your late 30's single or divorced and you have your own vehicle . I am looking for a friend who can just get up and go, no worries finding a babysitter. I decided to go on Craigslist to meet new people. If you need someone to talk to and get to know, if so let's meet up! Also have the same interests. Winter is here so I know a lot of people would not want to go anywhere. I need a friend who is willing to get out, of course if it's not snowing outside. Let's get ourselves out there and meet some men! I don't care about race. I do care if you are for real about this post. No bs. I know it takes time to get to know someone. I am not on here to meet people who just want to text and e-mail everyday and not planning to meet at all. Seriously if you're not thinking about hanging out soon please don't reply. 
Stay blessed.

Lets Meet at the Sculpture Garden for some ice skating. 

*****Note: The Sculpture Garden 2015-2016 Season ended on March 13, 2016*****
I'll most likely post this ad again in November when the rink re-opens. Warmer weather means less ice skating and more rollerblading********************

It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or Olympic caliber-- just have the desire to get out, enjoy the ice and get a good workout. 

As of 3/13/9/16 I went to the Sculpture Garden about 45 times between November and March. It was a great season! I love the exhilaration and pleasure that ice skating brings. After skating, we could stop into the cafe which is adjacent to the rink.

I posted these days and times for ice skating, but they apply also to rollerblading as spring approaches: 

Monday morning, afternoon, or evenings 
Tuesday mornings, afternoons or evenings 
Wednesday evenings 
Friday evenings 
Saturday evenings 
Sunday evenings 

I'm single--very fit, healthy, fun and have a youthful look and mindset. I guess I'm an intermediate skater -- way beyond a beginner but nowhere near an expert. I live in Old Town, Alexandria. Now that the outdoor rinks are closed, my ice skating will significantly less. When I do go in the warmer months, it will be at the Mount Vernon Rec Center (2017 Belle View Boulevard Alexandria, VA 22307)

A few good friends....

I am looking for a few honest, respectful, trustworthy type people who would eventually grow into a great friend. I am fairly new to the DMV and haven't really connected with many people who I would eventually call a friend. I am very laid back and fun; I am a lesbian aggressive woman. Sometimes, I just want to hit up a good brunch, catch a late night happy hour, listen to spoken word, walk around and tour DC with someone else or a group of people. I have a very outgoing personality; therefore, staying in the house is not my forte. I am 30+ years young, drug and drama free. I am well into my career; have my own and just love to go/see and do things! If you are at the point in your life where you are up for meeting new people, welcoming positive energy, then reply back. If you are inconsistent, have a drama-filled life and/or too busy to make a friend, please don't respond.

Hi, 

Is it possible to find a woman to be platonic friends with on CL? I mean the kind of ride-or-die friend they talk about on The Kane Show, if you are a listener. I do not have a laundry list of traits my new friend needs to have, but I will tell you about me:

I am married, live in Alexandria and love to read, listen to music, walk, spend time with family and learn new things. I can just as easily go to the mall as to the movies, theater or a museum, but I prefer the movies and wouldn't mind staying in and chatting, watching Netflix and just sharing the experience of being in D.C. during this time in our lives.

This is a transient town, so it can be hard to meet sincere, genuine people here. I am one of those people, though, so what about you?

Do you wish there was an older man in the local area with whom you could confide and share your ideas, questions, goals, successes, disappointments, and fantasies? Are you intrigued by the idea of having a completely open-minded father figure who will listen without criticizing or judging? Do you long for someone experienced and assertive with whom you can safely explore your submissive personality in a caring, nurturing way?

I am a local college instructor in my mid forties who would like to pursue with a younger woman a relationship that is more meaningful and less transient than the professional relationships I have with my students. You could be a college student or a college-educated young professional.

In order for this to work, you would need to be somewhere in the DC metro area and willing to meet in person. This would be our secret, so I don't mind if you are already in a relationship (as long as you don't mind the same about me).

If this sounds interesting, send me a paragraph on what you hope to find in a father-figure (yes, this is an assignment). If I like what you write, I'll get back to you; and we can meet for a cup of coffee and further discussion.

Hello and thanks for reading.

I will be visiting the DC area from 3/30 - 4/1 and hoping to find some good company to show me around while I'm there. I live in Colorado and am in no way considering moving away. Just have never been to DC and thought I'd check it out. I'll probably do the typical touristy stuff (White House and Monuments) so if you'd be interested in joining for that or have other suggestions, I would love to hear them.

Maybe you can suggest some good places to eat or have a drink? Maybe you can talk me into taking you out to one of those places?

I'm easy going, educated and can carry on a conversation. 

If interested, drop me a line and we can talk a little before I arrive.

Have a good day.

I would feel most at home in a commune or maybe an artist's cohabitation. The postmodern scenario that I exist in is somewhat different. A job I don't care about that sounds impressive or 'interesting' to some. Honestly I am looking for someone *creative* who understands or identifies with this duality - the admission that we don't all have trust funds or support of any kind coming to us, and therefore we make our way as best we can. I write songs. This is my therapy and my authenticity. It is also my connection to beauty in a city I find quite unbeautiful, where I feel I do not fit in, nor would I want to fit it. At this point you would probably assume I look funny or don't fit in visually, when in fact I look more like a business consultant or some careerist. I suppose I like that costumery aspect of work. It's simply a farce. Because of these beliefs, I have not gotten along well in some dating scenarios in which the other person fully buys into the 'I. Am. A. Professional' mentality. I am interested in more than 'professional people' - I am interested in people I connect with, whatever you do. Do you work at starbucks and go home and paint? I want to hear about this and go to a museum with you. Do you listen to lots of music and don't really care about your day job? I'd like to learn more from you and enjoy music together. I am open to more but I put this in platonic because I felt more people are real here.

I also do KIK if you're up for a little chat action.

If you opened this post, it must mean you are Indian and know what an ABCD means. So far so good. And it also means you are either curious about the post and/or are also looking for the same. The latter is more important.

About my search: I am looking for someone to call a true friend. Someone with whom I can have a coffee (or drink) with and we talk about life, family, work, politics, sports, Bollywood even. I'd perfer Indian b/c of the cultural similarities. I could go on and on about what more we could spend our time chatting about but that could be a chat in itself. Why a female friend? I seem to get along better with women than men and also I want to get female views on things we talk about. Obviously you are reading this becasue you are looking for a guy friend and perhaps want a view from a male perspective. 

About me: I am 45, married, have kids, have two masters (though none help me in what I do for a living but wanted to share that I am somewhat intelligent), I love what I do for work but hate this DC commuting (another chat subject??)

I am 5'10"", 175 lbs., in shape, pretty good looks (it's still nice to be noticed at 44), and I have a great sense of humor....sarcastic at times.

Hobbies: I love sports, hiking and I have to admit.....Bollywood movies. 

If the above (as short as it is) intrigues you...please email me. To weed out spammers, put ""Desi Friend"" in your subject heading and we will see if this friendship can start off with us liking each other over email. Write me something about why you also need a friend; why just respond with one line? .

Hey I hope you catch this but yeah I have, although it's a sad ending. I meet her about one year ago while at work. You see that's the first problem don't ever fall for a woman you work with. To me she was a stunner ,from head to toe, stylish, smart , a social butterfly if you can say that. As for me I was an ordinary guy , typical when you see someone you have an attraction too. I was extremely shy, not in great shape, a loner or what I have been called a lone wolf. I think whoever said that about me didn't like me very much but whatever. So I would tense up everytime she was around me ,act like a didn't mind her at all but soon it started to get to me. I never felt a feeling like that before and have never since. For you see it was a doomed connection I know that now, she like older guys not for the money but I really do believe she like older guys. But that's nature I guess , I see that alot young girls with older guys and vice versa. So I would stare into her eyes not knowing what I was doing but I guess my co workers saw it too. It wasn't a feeling of lust or passion for me, it was a feeling of acceptance. Finally I thought , somebody who I don't have to try to make her laugh or smile just be me and go with it. I hope I described it decently, but feelings are hard to describe. So it would go on every time I saw her, until she switched store locations, deep down I knew it was my fault , I probably made her uncomfortable. I wish i could apologize to her if i ever made her feel uncomfortable. I went one working , got promoted and switched locations same job but better store I guess. I knew if I were ever to have a chance I needed to help myself become better. So with a promotion if you want to call it that, I joined a gym, started reading ,and found my passion in life because of her. I knew I couldn't become a millionaire overnight so I went to the next best thing art. I heard women dig artists type. So I went on and on I would see her come by the store every once and I while and those feelings still remained. I would try not to stare but I couldn't help it. She probably to this day thinks I'm some kind of weirdo or psycho. But I learned a lesson from all of this , I guess some people aren't meant to be no matter how you feel. Take my advice ,if she rejects you the first time move on to the next, don't wait and hope she might feel the same way.

I am looking for young woman with an old soul. Someone to talk to who would enjoy the company of an thoughtful but aging man for conversation, people watching, motorcycle rides and fun stuff around the city this spring. But please note, I want to be your friend and companion, I do not want to be your sugar daddy. I do not even want to be your daddy. I have kids that I love and am not looking for another one. I understand that if you are younger you will be less financially ready to go out and spend money, and I don't mind paying for stuff, but there's plenty of stuff that we can do around the city that doesn't really require a lot of money. But I think it's na誰ve and condescending to think that the only way an older man and a younger woman can spend time together is by falling into either a sugar daddy relationship or a father daughter relationship. It seems sexist and ageist to think that way. I am divorced and I am happy with being single. I just like meeting different people and have dated and friended women from 18 all the way up to their mid 50s. When I was 15, my best friend was a 80 year old lady on my block who smoked Pall Mall unfiltered. I held her arm as we walked around the block so she could get her exercise. There are qualities to appreciate with everyone across the board, so please, no silly hate mail from haters who want to hate. I am very open to whom I meet and have ads that are for women closer to my own age. And I don't care much about your looks. Just be over 18, honest, kind, and sincere. As for me, I am tall, a deep thinker, a working DC professional but also dabble in art and music in my spare time. I like art, music, culture, politics, and like to get crazy just like anyone else.

So I am new here and have been in the area for about a week.

Currently unemployed but I had two extremely promising job interviews last week.

I'm living with my sister until I start work and get on my own two feet, because I love my independence.

My sister went out to hang out with her friends for the rest of the day, so I'm just sitting here bored and wondering what on Earth I should do with myself.

If anyone wants to come and hang that would just be great! -I'm no psycho person dude.

I came here from Buffalo, NY. I'd prefer someone who can hold an interesting conversation in just about anything but also someone fun. Maybe hang today and explore this city once it's sunny/I'm working.

Reply and I shall provide pics & phone number. 

I was in the military for six years and recently got out in August 2015. Now just trying to jumpstart a career in IT. Fairly smart guy. Not necessarily looking for sex, just female company.

I would love to find someone to chat with and see where it takes us. We could start with some email back and forth. I just want to find some fun flirty, intelligent conversation. I am open and adventurous, clean cut, professional, educated, and a genuine person, with a bit of a naughty side. I am better than average in the looks department. I am married, so this is strictly online and don't worry, I won't tell if you don't tell! I am willing to talk about whatever and I hope you are too. I am real, sane, normal, and plenty of fun. I have pictures if you do. Start by answering these three questions for me and then asking three of your own. And we can go back and forth and go from there.

1. If you could get on a plane and fly anywhere tomorrow, where would it be?
2. If you had a choice of one of these three and you had tickets to all three, and they were at the same time, which would you choose: concert of your favorite band, a sporting even of your favorite team, or tickets to the Kennedy Center for a play.
3. If you could be a living celebrity for one year, starting tomorrow, who would it be?

Answer me these questions three and find out more about me! And bonus points if you know what movie I am referencing in the title quote! Put ""Questions"" in the subject line, please.

Hello. Just looking for a potential friend. The almost literal meaning, if one can sift through life and find that. Full disclosure: not looking for anything more than friends, this is strictly platonic. Yet friends is a pretty high bar in life, I can only count on barely 2 hands who I would consider friends in my life. I value them immensely. 

I recently bought a book from Amazon by Adam Cohen, not his most recent, which I will shortly purchase I am sure. But his previous (or one of) re: FDR. I am always looking for new books to read. 
I am Christian, -- God means a lot to me and hope so for you as well. I try to spend as much time as possible outside, as time allows. What else. by most accepted standards I am intelligent. MENSA, etc. Or super intelligent, but I am blessed by God in so many ways for that. Advanced degrees, study in Europe, the whole nine years, etc. But I am humble and that is even more important to me. Who do I admire? Anyone who has used his/her life to affect good in this world, which I try to do as much as I can. I love my family and friends and just looking to talk. As I do with my friends when we go out. The art of conversation is becoming a lost art. 

I know that I will get about 50 angry replies, people will try to judge me, people will want to hook up, or give some rationalization why they will ignore my statements re:friends and want something far outside the bounds of decency. To all of those folks out there, I pray for you and hope someday you are able to live a live where you value yourself and your dignity and our of others. Here's some even more full disclosure breaking news: I'm one of those who does not ""need"" a relationship. I am emotionally, financially, intellectually, etc healthy. I don't need some guy to make me feel like I am worth living. That's the truth. My most important relationship is as a Christian to God, and praying for children who are suffering. That is the truth. I am blessed in so so many ways and each day I thank God. I thank God for the fact I have a beautiful house, car, food, career, health, I love my family. I thank him for their health and for my friends and for the fact it is raining now since it helps crops grow and gives us water. 

I know this post will offend many and many will take it upon themselves to write harsh, nasty replies to me. For the small chance I end up engaging with someone and meeting over coffee or tea, then it's worth the 3-4 minutes it took for me to type this :). Also, any book recommendations? Thank you for your time.

I don't really know what I'm looking for. More tending towards a friend and seeing where things go, than a hookup or a partner. 

I've been described as a total sub before. I enjoy pleasing, but in the bigger picture, I really like having a more dominant woman in my life that I can adore. Someone who actually -wants- to be adored, you know? Not even in a sexual way primarily. Personality-wise. It seems like all the women that I meet tend to be more submissive, which is fine...but it gets boring after a while. I can play the dom or the sub, but I've only ever met a small few women who enjoy taking control away from me. That kind of trust is very rare for me...and well sought-after. 

If this sounds like you, I'd really like to hear from you. Regardless, everyone, enjoy your day. Stay dry, it's raining out.

Hi! Thanks for reading my post. I am known around the city by a lot of the museums and galleries. I attend lectures on a regular basis. I usually like the big names and famous people with international recognition. I enjoy lectures on art, physics, poetry and many other subjects. I sometimes talk a little rapidly, but for those with an interest in what I am talking about it usually is well received. For instance, this morning I was having a lovely exchange with a barista putting on a presentation on four types of coffee she was brewing and we discussed different types of beans a and brewing techniques. I also was talking with a lovely architect from Wisconsin and we were toe to toe in discussing the development in Washington, with different architects and developers. Then I briskly hung out at SAAM for some coffee, tea, and to ride their WIFI in the LUCE area of the gallery. Then, I ran to the NGA for a classical mandolin concert with an excellent percussionist, with a dessert of one of the last documentaries of a famous icon in filmography. This is actually being written unbeknownst to me in fictional form by a friend of mine trying to set me up. 

If you like to solder or stand in lines I'd love to buy your old solder gun, or pay you to stand in line for Congressional hearings/ All jokes aside, if you like art and running around the city I am always availed to company.

This post if for my friend. Yes, I am a match maker like the movie, ""Fiddler on the Roof."" But, this is about him and not me.

6'2, thin swimmer's build, blond hair, with a very mild mannered look about him. He actually has great endurance too as he rides his bicycle to and from the city for arts and cultural events to include, tech start-ups, art receptions, conventions, ceremonies, independence days, lectures, etc. If it has a good reception, then more than likely he is interested. He also likes to memorize poetry and is able to recite it. He sells used books and frequents estate sales, libraries, and all sorts of places with dust and the smell of old things. You can also find him on Sunday at the flea market in Georgetown selling his jewelry which is another side job of his. He also does a d.j. show playing music of his choosing usually with some quirky poetic messages usually with strong female roles such as Goldfrapp.

I think, but I could have the wrong author, but he likes the Emily Dickinson look. WASPY, nerdish, plain, dry lips, a bit odd, awkward, au naturel in all ways, shy, people are somewhat his type. We recently saw a movie with Anne Heche and he found her short hair and disco dancing hot. 

He is somewhat in a ""Catch 22"" situation as he never approaches anyone, and the type of person he likes would never approach him. So, he is left memorizing this poetry with no one to recite it to.

So, I have been around the area for awhile. We have a very large LGBT population. I recently had some work done on my home and the contractor basically looked down on me and treated me like an infectious little worm the entire time. I can only assume it was because I am gay. The look of disgust that carried was overwhelming to say the least. That being said, I am an electrician with 25 years of experience in residential, commercial, and industrial. I was considering starting an electrical company that caters directly to the aforementioned community. 
Is it legal to target a specific demographic?
Do you think it would be successful?
Would you hire a company that only worked for the LGBT community?
Have you ever experienced the same ""degradation""?

Just wondering if anyone thinks it would soar, or flop.

Thank you for your input, and have a wonderful weekend.

Let me start by saying that I'm 43 years old and married with kids. I work in the city, have a long commute and struggle to find time to spend with my family, so that's my priority when I'm home. Having said that, I do find the wake-train-work-kids-sleep-repeat cycle wears on me sometimes and I find myself craving a break from my reality. I'm thinking having an email buddy to share life's ups and downs or just talk about whatever comes up would provide just that sort of mental break from everyday life. I guess I'd just love to find a good friend that's just for me and a place to go to discuss whatever I need or want to with no judgement or pretense. Out of necessity this friendship will be a secret, I wouldn't expect my wife to understand and she would naturally be concerned. 

I'm not quite how to get this started but I'm open to friends any sort, though I think a female most definitely fits best for this pupose. However, age, race, looks, location are of no importance for this purpose. Please just be mature (most of the time, ha!) and able to hold up your end of a grown up conversation.

I think I should probably give you a quick look into my makeup so you can make an educated decision whether to take a leap and send a reply. I've thought some about how to do that but settled on a simple stream of consciousness, forgive me if it seems random and a bit trivial, but it's the best I can do here:

I love to read and my library card is one of my prize possessions
Some of my best childhood memories involve trips to the library with my mom. 
I take my boys to our library frequently and hope they'll have some of those same great memories.
I've grown a little more adventurous with food as I've aged and had a chance to travel. Though I still refuse to eat certain basics that you will find strange. 
My boys are my world and I take very seriously the responsibility of raising them. 
I desperately hope I'll be able to help mold them into responsible, respectful, kind, compassionate yet independent and strong young men. 
My favorite thing is to coach them in their various park district sports. Those practices and games are the most fun I have these days. 
I work in finance and have a somewhat stressful job and long commute. It is rewarding at times but also the source of my biggest regret, the time that it takes me away from home. 
Even though I work in finance, math has always been a weakness. I work hard not to let that show. 
I spend an hour each way on the train and hope you will help me fill that time with some interesting conversation. 
I try to be transparent and do my best not to judge others and I'm almost impossible to offend. 
Im organizationally challenged at times and as a result can seem non responsive or unconcerned with timeliness or deadlines. I'm working on that. Ha! 

That's probably enough for now. If you've managed to get through this entire email and still have some interest, please send a reply!

Seeking these qualities for this with a female:

Non-Smoker
Social Drinking acceptable
No Drug Use
DD Free
Athletic and/or physically fit
Clean and takes care of appearance
Caucasian preferred, however females are considered if both of us agree to engagement...

Mutual chemistry, connection and attraction are important with engagement...

If chosen, YOU will be my first in this to fulfill my fantasy in double... It is important that all things fall into place and have a great time in the making :) ... You should be adventurous as we are looking for a third for preferably ongoing experiences...

About him... a lethal combination of tall, handsome, and sexy...
About her... a ginger with personality, beauty, and sexy to boot...

Both of us are Professional, very Good Looking, Athletic, DD Free, Non-smokers, Drinks Socially, and DO NOT Use/Do Drugs...

Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement... 

PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING WHEN RESPONDING: We expect to email, chat, exchange pics and speak on the phone prior to meeting... (photo and general information will be inquired to get to know you personally)...

SERIOUS INTEREST and INQUIRIES ONLY!!!... NO MALES... NO DRAMA.... NO DISINGENUOUS REPLIES!!!

FURTHERMORE: Not looking to engage in convo that leads to a dead end, meaning that no progression is made so we can see were this might lead! Meeting socially to see if we have connection/chemistry with casual conversation, interaction and if we do we can go from there. If we do connect, great! If we don't, we can part ways respectfully... 

This could lead to an ongoing friendship and possibly more, but if it only ends up in one or more fun evenings out, that would be great too...

Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement (photo and some general information will be requested to get to know you personally)...

SERIOUS INTEREST AND INQUIRIES ONLY!... NO MALES. NO DRAMA....

So if you are interested in being a playmate or even possibly part of a triad let us know. Please put ""Respectfully Yours"" in the subject line, include pics, experience, desires and expectations... Please feel free to reply to this email or Kik us if interested: my handle is VenusVegas...

I do some woodworking - nothing too complex but I'm hoping to improve my skills. I'm currently making Shaker oval boxes like the attached picture and have some ideas for furniture. It would be great to find someone who does this as a hobby as well. I'm not looking for an instructor but someone to work on projects with and maybe learn from each other along the way. I also have involved myself in other non-woodworking projects - always interested in creative release and making something with my own hands.

I have quite a few tools, table saw, and so forth but it would always be nice to have a like-minded person with whom to swap and borrow tools on occasion. It would be great to find someone with a good band saw. :)

I'm 37, male, live in the Alexandria area.

Any Studio Ghibli fans out there? I've really gotten into all their movies and the work of Hayao Miyazaki the last couple of years. Unfortunately I have no friends who share in my nerd ways. Anyone want to talk Studio Ghibli films, comics, anime, or anything geeky. I figure we can become email or text buddies to make the day more interesting. Just send me a message with your favorite Studio Ghibli film or anything you want to talk about.

Most woman have a list of requirements and must have's that are superficial...that's why they can never find what they want. Most women act like you will be friends forever, but disappear once they stop using you. Most women want a man that's a finished product, while they are still getting themselves together.

Most attached woman claim that they only want a friend, when in reality they want a guy who will give them what they are missing at home. Most women who claim that ""they got you"" never intend on giving you anything back in return. Most women want attractive guys to befriend, while they are a 5 at best and feel the need to act stuck up. Most women only want to cry on the good guys shoulder, while the bad guys fucks them over and over again. If you only want a friend, why is the first thing you ask is 
""Can I get a pic"" 

These are just some things that I have witnessed. So ladies if you feel that my opinion is wrong, feel free to chime in.

Bored? Looking for some excitement a few weekends this summer? I'm looking for an open-minded, drug-free travel companion this summer. I have a couple trips to North Carolina, Pennsylvania and maybe even South Carolina coming up soon and would like to not do it alone. These trips are car club related so expect lots of cruising, picture taking and car talk with fellow enthusiasts. Generally, these trips are Thursday thru Sunday but vary. SC may be 9-10 days.

You should be late 20s to late 40s, on the shorter side (think 5'4"" and below), HW proportional (No BBW sorry), attractive but not looking for a model, non smoker would be preferred and willing to play the part of my girlfriend as required in public settings. This would include some kissing and touching to be believable.

This is not an advertisement for sex. I'm not paying you with money but you get the thrill of travel, all your food and drinks covered and I'm fine with buying you clothing to make you look good. Basically, you get a sugar daddy for a weekend without having to have sex with me. 

Me: 42, short, bearded and bald, not a big, fat guy but I need to start running again. I drink, absolutely no drugs, non smoker and white.

Your pic gets mine. Include something about yourself.

Hello friends, 

I have posted my appeal before and here I go again, hoping for a Good Samaritan to save me out there. I am in desperate need of a kidney transplant!!Hmmmm...it is amazing the simple things we take for granted like drinking a glass of water, eating a banana, using the bathroom e.t.c which may be a huge undertaking when one has kidney failure!! Also , the idea of sitting on a dialysis machine for 4 hours /3 times a week come rain or shine is taking its toll on me. To be fair, I need to inform you though that organ donation is no small fit ( as it involves surgery). Before anyone can be allowed to donate has to be in very good healthy both physically and mentally.....and of course in consultation with your family. I am fully aware that I am asking for an incredibly difficult gift because donating a gift ....especially to a total stranger is not easy, But I also know that there are some exceptional altruist people out there who do it ( you can Google for more information) and I will never give up hope. Please note, that I am asking for a donation . However, if I got a willing donor, the medical costs and other expenses like time away from work, travel e.t.c will be covered. Should you have any questions about how you may help, I will gladly answer them. 

Thank you in advance.

I find myself feeling somewhat restless, and looking for sustained connections online. My goal in doing this isn't to engage in a torrid physical affair but rather to find steady electronic interaction (mainly via email) with someone who stimulates me intellectually, emotionally, and physically.

I'm seeking someone in the 32-40 age range. Also, I'd prefer if she was reasonably well educated and engaged in professional careers. (No, I won't be expecting to see a resume, but there will be more common ground with someone in a white collar occupation.) I'm a fit, active person, and I'd prefer someone who is similarly inclined (runner, yogi practitioner, etc.), or at least fits into the ""HWP"" category. There are some other characteristics that I value, but they seem rather generic and subjective: sense of humor, literacy, taste in music, books, wine, etc. 

Finally, I won't try to meet you in person, nor will I inflict unsolicited pictures of my genitalia on you. I'll just be a regular, nice guy.

Like the title says I am married and in a sexually unfulfilling relationship. Not looking to end my marriage or Bing any drama into your life, but more so looking for someone to actually connect with and form something beyond just sex.

A little about me, I am 30 years old, white, 6ft tall and stay active in the gym one to two times a day. I can't think of a day that I have had where I have felt wanted by someone else and just really miss that feeling of excitement and getting to know someone new that doesn't mind me being married.

Ideally I would like to find someone that is just as physically active as I am and enjoys staying in shape. Race isn't in issue for me and I would love to find a single girl that wouldn't mind being my friend, but expect that I would connect better with another married woman that is just as unfulfilled as me.

If anything you have read piques' your interest and you would like to get to know me please feel free to message me, but put ""Secret Friends"" in the subject so I know your not spam! 

You can also hit me up on kik, davtra26. Please include a picture with all responses.

I'm a newbie to the yoga scene and wanted you as my personal tour guide of everything yoga. You can be a newbie as well or more advanced; I just feel as though everything is better when it's done with someone else. Experience wise I'm a little past beginner but my form probably sucks for most poses. At least that's how I feel when I look at the video and see myself in the mirror. Being that is strictly platonic I wouldn't expect anything related to looks. I'm not that bad myself but again this is just for a yoga buddy. I would go so far as to join a class with you. Would prefer a woman only because it's bad enough I'm doing yoga lol I refuse to do it with a guy no offense (that's just plain gay) pause. So if you are in need of a yoga partner or want a tutor to master your yoga instructor skills send me a email asap.

After reading through a number of postings on CL in the strictly platonic section, I decided to try posting myself seeking a woman with a similar paradigm since no post I read seems to have what I seek. Let me start off by stating that this is a real post and I am not seeking random sex, a quick hook up and I am not a picture collector. I seek a sincere amazing mental connection and friendship to start. Ideally you are a woman who is smart, can laugh at herself, good conversationalist, honest, happy but seeking to enhance our life with a new friend, family-oriented and a bit playful (this does not mean crude talk). I believe I have those qualities that I seek in addition to being active/athletic, successful, handsome and playful. I am a white male who is seeking a white female who is looking for a new connection. I enjoy cooking, good movies, reading, antique shops, the beach, working out/cross fit training, great conversation and much more. I would love to learn more about your interests and I have an inquisitive mind so I hope you don't mind questions. We all live in our daily circles and have busy lives with friends and family so meeting new quality people can, at times, be a challenge. By posting here, I thought it might result in expanding my daily interactions and possibly resulting in a good friend who enjoys similar activities and conversation.

This is a new endeavor for me so I would hope we could email first and learn about one another. No rush for anything, just a good friendship to start and see how things organically proceed. If you are intrigued enough to respond to this post, please type in your age in the subject line so I know you are real. Age range is 30-50. I am hopeful there is someone reading this as sincere as I am who is not looking to play games or engage in random acts of nonsense.

Hello,
I am a huge music fan but in the past years, I have not made it out to too many concerts. I have a goal of going to as many concerts as possible this year. I went to Howard and stayed in the area. Many of my friends either moved out of the area or don't have the same music interests. I would love to also meet some new friends (it's really hard after college.) I already went a concert alone this year, It wasn't horrible but I rather go with someone.
I am an R&B/Soul junkie so I'm planning on going to 
Tori Kelly - DAR-4/23

I'm also thinking about seeing Musiq and Boys II Men.

Besides the fact that I'm posting on craigslist I am a normal person and would also like a normal person to respond to this!

Ideally, I'd like to meet someone that will encourage me to do things i haven't done. An outgoing guy that would enjoy a walk in D.C, going to the movies, or just staying in, go for a hike, a road trip or a diner. Someone that would bring me out of my comfort zone... Many of these things I don't get to do them often.
Very polite guy, raised and educated with moral values and taught to appreciate what I have. Have just started school, taking it slow as my job takes the majority of my time. It's a long way to go, but confident that will reach the goal. An Avgeek, commercial airliner, airplane obsessed and world traveler.. (no, not a FA) 
Have a job that I love, but stress me a bit. Trying to find ways to forget about job stress and have a great time with new friends or a date, why not? Enjoy traveling the world! I haven't visited many cities in the US and would be great to have travel buddies! but there are places that are just a mazing when visited with that one person you feel for.
I don't discriminate in any way, but people around my age would be great to meet!! Enthusiastic and always eager to try new things. Also, I respect the way you are, but really not compatible with a fem guy. I am a man, that likes to do men's things and hoping to meet someone like that.
Not consider myself as the best looking guy, but guess I am ok... Latino tan skinned. Have been told I've got a nice smile. not so tall, 5'7 and neither a big guy or skinny guy.
I am always open to suggestions, making new friends and definitely advises on how to meet a good guy (ha).
Have a good one!

It's been almost a year and a half since I came out to my family. I never felt comfortable dating or meeting people and hiding from them at the same time. Now that i feel stress free and comfortable, i'd like to meet great people and make friends and of course, meet the one that will sweep my feet off the ground. Though coming out would make it easy, it hasn't been the case. Probably its me for not being that much social, or having a big circle of friends. But still, been single since ever (haha)
Not really into bars or clubbing. More of a home guy and great time with friends. 
It's come to the time where I am always questioning whether I would ever meet someone, or why is it that I can't feel happy with the things I do.
Consider myself a good hearted person that finds pleasure in helping others and knowing that I brought a smile in their faces. We all have likes, and respecting that is a must.

I am a married Hispanic male in my late 30's seeking to have a child with Woman seeking the same. 
My wife is older than I am and already had four children of her own, complete with a tubal ligation when we met and fell in love. We have been married for 17 years and she is very much supportive of my desire to have a child of my own. She does not plan to take on the role of another Mother, but does want to be referred to as the child's God Mother, as we believe this child will be a gift from God for all parties involved. 

I prefer creating this child with a single female or even a lesbian couple, but will also consider a heterosexual couple unable to have a child of their own. I prefer no other man in the mix because I do want to be an active Father in this child's life, however I would consider sharing the role of ""Daddy"" and would encourage you to contact me if you are such a couple that otherwise feels like it may be a good fit for all involved. I also prefer someone who doesn't live too far from Woodbridge VA, as the logistics will be a monthly concern. I am non-smoker, non-drug user and I do not drink alcohol. 

Please contact me via email if you are at all interested in taking this consideration to the next level. I so look forward to hearing from you.

Married 40-something dad, professional and fairly normal in most respects. I've got this crazy desire to cheat suddenly, after more than 20 years of happy marriage. There's nothing wrong at home, nothing I need that I'm not getting, no lack of intimacy or desire or companionship. But these past few months, it seems all I can think about is being with another woman. No one specific -- just anyone different.

I know thoughts of sex with others can't be unusual but I can't help but wonder what's spurring it, if women get these kinds of crazy out-of-nowhere impulses and what they do about them. I won't cheat, but I wish I could stop thinking about it so much. It's also something I feel like I can't talk to my wife about, although we are very open with each other. I feel like it would hurt her and she would assume I'm unhappy, which I'm not. 

Any thoughts or replies would be welcome.

Hi!

I'm a random guy looking to chat. I'm looking to make a new friend or someone to just talk to on a regular basis about life, hobbies, and random topics. I am married which I know throws people off and flags me as ""that guy"" on Craigslist, but I assure you I'm generally a good guy just looking have friendly conversation.

The Bad: If you're looking for sex, someone on the side, to cheat, a fling, relationship, or anything like that, keep on looking. I don't even want to send you a picture of my junk, so don't ask!

As for topics, I'm happy to discuss: Movies, books, wine, tv shows, outdoors, cars, music, relationship stuff, or really whatever you want. I lack a huge interest in sports or beer that most guys have, so if you're an alcoholic sports junkie, you might want to keep looking as well.

Shoot me a message if you're interested. I hope you're having a good year so far.

Are you a 16-25 year old man? We need your opinion! You are invited to participate in an online survey about the healthcare needs of young gay, bisexual, same gender loving, and men who have sex with men.

Researchers at GW are hoping to learn about how we can improve healthcare services for young men interested in preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The anonymous survey will take about 20-30 minutes and can be done on a tablet, a smartphone, or a computer. Eligible participants will receive a $25 gift check.

We could start completely platonic, just chatting about whatever, and even stay that way if we want. This is in the platonic section because I don't expect anything to actually come from it - but I am a dude and sex will probably come up, so I thought I would be honest about it :)

I'm a 5'7 Arlington area Asian male, recently single after 7 years looking for female companionship but not completely ready for a serious relationship. Described as successful, easy-going, and compassionate by friends (though I'm skeptical of the veracity of those claims)

Ideally, I'd like to meet someone that likes similar activities or can introduce me to new hobbies. Someone available weeknights as I have custody of my kids Friday night - Sunday afternoon (with some exceptions). To be clear, I'm looking for a friend with something extra assuming the attraction is there.

I like the following things (but am open to just about anything):

- anything related to music, karaoke, dancing, playing instruments
- exercise related activities like running, gym, etc. 
- cooking for people, cooking for one is a lot of hassle and sharing a meal is more enjoyable
-anime/comic book type entertainment (batman v superman anyone?)

Please reply with a brief description of yourself and what you think we'll be able to do together for fun.

I am going through a very difficult time in my life, things are really bad. It all started with a tragic personal loss, no nobody died....but it was a heartbreaking loss nonetheless. It led to a stretch where I honestly couldn't even get myself out of bed or get myself to do or care about anything at all. That obviously funneled its way down to so many other aspects of my life and they obviously were effected in very negative ways. To put it simply, I lost the love of my life and everything else pretty much went to shit along with it. I don't have the money to go see a therapist or shrink, not that I even think that would help. I'm not in a depression, cause I can still laugh and have a good time, I just dread anytime of day or any single moment where I have the quiet time to think about my circumstances. I know I need to keep myself busy, yet at the same time I can't bring myself to do anything at all, talk about counterproductive right. there is just this overlaying cloud of melancholy that is hovering over me and it sucks and I thought that maybe there is someone out there going through something similar. Maybe we can support each other through it all, I don't know....I don't even know if CL is what it once was, maybe it's nothing but bots and psychos and scammers, but maybe, just maybe there is someone out there that can relate and that wants to meet someone who is going through something similar. If there is, get back too me and we can go from there. If not, well best of luck to all of you and hopefully I figure out what in the world I need to do.

I prefer you to be single, close to my age and local, so we can relate easily and maybe have a coffee together from time to time. I like emails. Texts are ok, but should not be the only way to communicate, phone is ok too, but I am not a fan!

Anyone up for meeting up for a couple of drinks and some conversation. I'm truly not searching for sex or a date or any of that.

Maybe this is could be the start of a regular thing..Happy Hours, random outings etc etc. I'm 32, of mixed race, pretty laid back, well traveled, educated, and would like to meet someone who fits some of those same qualities. Oh it wouldn't hurt if you are smoking hot either, but that's just an aesthetic thing, deep down just be fun, light hearted, understanding, and please don't be one of those women who will unknowingly spend 2 hours informing me of all the drama in her life and then tell me that I'm such a great friend and it was great talking to me. I mean I am a great listener and I am very empathetic to what anyone may be going through, but PLEASE I want to go out to have some fun and so should you, I don't want to be your therapist and I don't need you to be mine. If we can adhere to that then we should get along great. Oh and please be able to talk about more than just pop culture....

Like the title says I am married and in a sexually unfulfilling relationship. Not looking to end my marriage or Bing any drama into your life, but more so looking for someone to actually connect with and form something beyond just sex.

A little about me, I am 30 years old, white, 6ft tall and stay active in the gym one to two times a day. I can't think of a day that I have had where I have felt wanted by someone else and just really miss that feeling of excitement and getting to know someone new that doesn't mind me being married.

Ideally I would like to find someone that is just as physically active as I am and enjoys staying in shape. Race isn't in issue for me and I would love to find a single girl that wouldn't mind being my friend, but expect that I would connect better with another married woman that is just as unfulfilled as me.

If anything you have read piques' your interest and you would like to get to know me please feel free to message me, but put ""Secret Friends"" in the subject so I know your not spam!

So, my wife and I recently talked about the important things in our relationship and SURPRISE! She's not too interested in fulfilling everything that marriage would entail. I like to cuddle, I like to kiss, and I like sex. I don't want to cheat and told her as much. So, we've decided that since these are not things she's interested in, I can now pursue these things outside of the marriage with a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy.

I'm an early 30s, well educated black man who enjoys working out (lifting heavy things), good conversation, great entertainment and just plain fulfillment. You can see my measurables if these are important.

What I'm Looking For

- I'm looking for a woman who enjoys spending time together cuddling, kissing, and sexing. Also, joining me in doing interesting things around town would be a plus.

- I do not have a racial requirement as I find it silly to believe that emotional, physical, and sexual attractions are based on something so minor. 

- I do however, have a physical requirement: be smaller than me. While I am a supportive person, people who dismiss my positive reassurance for body issues drain my spirit. If you have some pleasant curves or are taller than the average girl and have no issues based on the stores you can't comfortably shop in, we can get to know each other.

- Sense of humor

I'm sure I might not be every woman's choice due to my circumstance. I will not be pursuing a divorce. Discretion will be key. But given what is missing in my life, I still have a lot to give.

We lived we loved and till the end like that we did stay
And when we leave there be no sighs
No sullen tears or weary smiles
Let us be remembered as those who loved deeply and dearly
Who knew that they wanted to be together from the first moment clearly
So now that we have each other let us be glad
Leave behind all things that make us sad
I hope we can start afresh and build a perfect life
One that is free of hatred, sorrow or strife.

Hello there. 

I am looking for a female or a female and her friends to watch me give a blowjob to another guy. I have everything in order, other than the willing female(s) who want to watch. 
I know that this isn't for everyone, but if you are curious, want to watch, or if this is your thing, then please reply. You can watch solo or bring some girl friends along as well. Let me make this clear. You will NOT be asked to do anything. This is just you watching, giggling, having a good time, enjoying some wine, whatever. The point is, is that you will not be asked to engage in anything other than being a spectator. 
I am a nice guy. I'm polite and professional. I'm a normal guy. I like movies, sports, cooking, animals, and I play music. I'm white/34 years old/ average build/ drug free. This is just something that I have always wanted to try. So, if you have always wanted to see this or are just curious, then here is your chance. 
We can talk over the phone first and get to know each other. We can meet in a neutral location and get some lunch. I just want you to be comfortable. I don't want a lot of people knowing about this, as I am not open about this. Of course, I am willing to make a friendship out of this, but this is something that I really want to try and have a female watching.
Please send any inquiries/thoughts to me and I will answer the best that I can. Hopefully, I will find someone who will explore this side of me. 

Serious female inquiries only please.

I'm hoping to find someone like minded who would like to share their ideas, goals, and general life experiences with someone outside their immediate circle and would love to connect with someone on different levels. We can talk about anything. I'm at point in my life where I would like to meet someone who can motivate me and I her. 

I have no real preference of race, status, etc... as I'm an open minded guy. Just hoping to find someone with whom I may have a few things in common. I'm consistently trying to learn from people and better myself and my goal is to get to know one woman and maybe go to lunch and chat with down the road.

Hi,

First of all, this is a serious advert. I am not looking for a mature woman just to satisfy my whims but someone who is comfortable talking to a younger guy. I am 28, and looking for someone 10 years older than myself ideally. But I am not rigid so if you're in between 35-55 that's perfect.

So why an older girl? Because I don't want the drama of the younger ones. I want someone who can be, first and foremost, my friend. Someone from whom I can learn as well and share anything. I think I am looking for someone who is more of a friend and open minded as well.

If you're well educated, working or a businesswoman that would be ideal.

Really hope to hear from someone soon :)

Hello there. 

I am looking for a female or a female and her friends to watch me give a blowjob to another guy. I have everything in order, other than the willing female(s) who want to watch. 
I know that this isn't for everyone, but if you are curious, want to watch, or if this is your thing, then please reply. You can watch solo or bring some girl friends along as well. Let me make this clear. You will NOT be asked to do anything. This is just you watching, giggling, having a good time, enjoying some wine, whatever. The point is, is that you will not be asked to engage in anything other than being a spectator. 
I am a nice guy. I'm polite and professional. I'm a normal guy. I like movies, sports, cooking, animals, and I play music. I'm white/34 years old/ average build/ drug free. This is just something that I have always wanted to try. So, if you have always wanted to see this or are just curious, then here is your chance. 
We can talk over the phone first and get to know each other. We can meet in a neutral location and get some lunch. I just want you to be comfortable. I don't want a lot of people knowing about this, as I am not open about this. Of course, I am willing to make a friendship out of this, but this is something that I really want to try and have a female watching.
Please send any inquiries/thoughts to me and I will answer the best that I can. Hopefully, I will find someone who will explore this side of me. 

Serious female inquiries only please.

Since I don't want to waist your time let me quickly tell you something about myself in case you find something that I mention as a show stopper.

I am separated from my wife with NO possibility of reconciliation. I have a 20 year step son away in college and a 10 year old daughter who I love dearly. I should be getting a divorce later this year.

I work from home in software development and since I work from home do not have a lot of direct contact with ladies during the day and that is why I have posted this ad on Craigslist.

I am smart, honest and hardworking although I am a little shy.

I am white although your race is not important to me.

I'm open to any socioeconomic background, race, age (18+) -- I'd like to pick someone who is equally curious to meet up somewhere and tell the 100% truth and think out loud. If we can agree to give each other 100% assurance that we will keep our experiment confidential, it would be fascinating to hear the ""truth"" of what people are thinking about when they are having a conversation and it would be fascinating to be able to ask something anything and have them tell the truth. Clearly things like SSN or ATM PIN are off the table, but it would be fascinating to both talk to someone with all filters off. It would also be kind if intriguing for me to make myself transparent like this. We can give ourselves timeouts so we aren't overwhelmed. The goal of this is to learn and have fun, not freak each other out. Please say a little about yourself in your reply.

Opening weekend at the stadium! Should be a fun time!

Bring a hat, some sunblock and your witty banter and easy going personality and let's go! 
I am a single white female, college educated, 40, no kids, attractive, employed, fit, fun and a lover of baseball!

I don't know all the stats of all the players, or who wears what brand of sock, but I do understand the sport and I love a day at D.C's own leading LEED stadium! 
I imagine I will receive several responses, so to weed out spam, the guys in jail (YES, convicts have access to the internet! LOL) and the married ""but only on paper"" guys, the following are my caveats:
You must be a heterosexual male who is in my appropriate dating age range. Say, about 35-47 +/- for good measure. I can't really have a hot 24 year old on my arm. . .. Well, I take that back- I can! And given the right 24 year old hottie, I'd be willing to make an exception ;-) After all, it is just a baseball game! 
You must be really SINGLE (Not ""separated"", Not ""attached"", Not ""engaged"", or otherwise encumbered with a partner. I don't disrespect other women, and I won't be a party to your lies or wishful thinking)
You must be FUN! 
You must have higher than a High School Education. Please do not respond to me if you've never traveled outside of your zip code or if you've never been on a plane. 
You must be not be a jack-ass. My tickets are part of my alumni group, and I can't have a Johnny Knoxville wannabe as my date. If you act like an ass, I will distance myself from you, block your #, and leave with someone else. Simple.

Other than those few things, I don't have a whole lot of requirements. Just be easy going, like baseball and open to meeting new people!
Looking forward to your reply!

Hi,

I am looking for someone who needs/enjoy giving massage. 

A little bit about me. I am a grad student (male- 29 & straight). I am supposed to take regular massage. But it is bit expensive although I feel good once I take it.I am just thinking if someone is in similar situation. I am respectful, and should not cross the boundary of your defined privacy. At the same time I am not that shy. I can show you how to do it and you can apply over me. You don't need to be expert on this. Similarly, I can follow what you want. 

Race or age is not important. If you are old or young, that's not my concern. I just wish to get rid off my pain. If you enjoy giving it or having it I have no issue. 

If you are in college/school and need someone to help in science, math or GRE/SAT, I can help you on exchange of that.

If you have skin diseases or any transmittable disease please don't contact. Knowingly transmitting disease or not acknowledging it might end up in legal issues. I am careful about CL people and know how to deal with it. I will prefer someone educated, legitimate and sane person without police record. Feel free to contact.

Hi There,

If you are reading this ad then it means probably you are in a similar situation. You are married and bored with your current situation, BUT you are not looking to end your marriage as too much is involved.

You still love your spouse (but more as a friend), and you just want to put a spark back in your life. Your probably not sure on what is needed to get the spark, but you're in search of it. Is it an email/chat buddy? coffee/Lunch buddy? Happy hour or more buddy?

That's my situation and I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking for..other than a spark. If you are in the same boat email me and lets see what we can discover. I can send you pic for pic.

I am not local, but I used to live in the DMV area, and I frequently travel back and forth, so I will be available to meet up occasionally throughout the year. I have one good friend in the DMV, but it's always good to have more girlfriends in the area. If interested, read on.

I am a black woman over 40 years of age. I am married, no children, no pets, but love animals. I am a nonsmoker and occasional social drinker. I do not do drugs. I am not into religion at all and would prefer to meet atheists, agnostics, or someone who defines herself as spiritual, but not religious. I enjoy traveling, attending concerts, plays, brunch, dinner, pampering myself with manicures, pedicures, massages, and just enjoying life. I am simply seeking down-to-earth, REAL female friends (nothing more) who are also black/of African heritage, over 35 years of age, and prefer if you have no children (but if you do, not a dealbreaker). If you are open to our main modes of communicating being phone conversations, email, text messaging, social media, Skyping (or Facetiming), and meeting when I'm in town (which will be in May), then please respond.

Thanks!

My Fiance is an avid wrestler for sport and exercise, but unfortunately her activity partner moved away. She is not trained and neither should you, it is more of a ""sparring"" type partner who wants to competitively wrestle for fun. We host it at our home and it's not sexual or anything strange like the majority of these other posts. It's fully clothed and good, clean, spirited fun. She is 25, 5'4, 145 lbs. We are both working professionals and would like to find someone who is also of that type of lifestyle. Since it's difficult to find partners, the compensation would be 60 dollars for each match you do with her and an extra 40 dollars if you win, just to throw an incentive for you to be competitive. If interested, please contact me.

So spring is here and I want to meet up with someone into either taking photos or being photographed (maybe even both). I'm interested in revamping my portfolio for the spring while making a friend or two (sorta like networking). If you have photography or modeling experience, that's cool. But it's not required.

About me: I'm a 31yo artist (digital illustration, web design and photography) and athlete (MMA, boxing, wrestling, running, cycling and future triathlons). I live in the Ballston area. I compete in a couple different sports and do a lot of fitness/ sports photography. I work a lot with athletes, bit would like to branch out and diversify myself. It would be nice to be able to target other groups like families and corporate folks.

My dream is to become a self sufficient entrepreneur. In other words, I wanna earn a living working for myself doing things I love and am good at. Besides the obvious reasons to network, meeting with others is good for accountability. I work alone now; another dream of mine is to team up with others who are as passionate about my ideas. But the main reason for this post is to find a model and or fellow photographer who is interested in meeting up. No experience or equipment required.

Hey everyone!

I've been trying for a month now to find a friend on here but everyone is either 1 just emailing back and forth then eventually stop. Or 2 we plan to hang out and they say they're going to but then have every excuse in the book as to why they can't when it's time to. 😑 So I'm trying one last time. 

I just got here and I somewhat work a lot but not really. But I would like a friend that like to hookah, shop, have pj parties, go out to bars, like to get nails done together, travel, like to get dressed up and just do girly things together. Someone around my age like 24 to 28. Race doesn't matter but know I'm in love with old school 90's r&b, and a few of the r&b and hip hop songs that's out today. I'm off this weekend and would really like to go out and smoke some hookah with a friend so please respond if you're serious. 

It doesn't matter if you're lesbian or bi just know that I'm straight and would like a friend that's girly as I am. 

So if this is you I'm waiting for your response 😊😊

I work at a major DC research institution. Looking to meet a well educated guy to discuss US and world history, co-read history and biography tomes, and possibly visit historical sites.

I am a bit of an introvert but once I open up I make a great conversationalist and even a better listener. Not into endless emails or pen pal situations. Please live in the DC METRO area. Also- please answer your emails regularly. I am also interested in making a friend with whom to explore DC restaurants and museums and attend cultural activities.

Hey guys!

I'd like to start off by clarifying that I am ultimately looking for something serious/long-term. I posted in strictly platonic because ""friends first"" seems like the best route to take, for me at least. 

I'm looking for someone who(yes, an annoying list):

-likes to be spontaneous, but also enjoys nights in. 
-Someone I can take with me (and who WANTS to come along with me) to parties and out with my friends. (I don't go to a lot of parties...just mentioning it, should the occasion arise :P)
-not any type of requirement, but it would be awesome if you loved animals just as much as I do! (And no...I'm far from being vegan lmao)
-likes to cuddle. Obviously
-is a kid at heart!! 
-between the ages of 29-33 (I'm aiming for a little older)
-is just really down to earth and loves homey (is that even a word) things


A little bit about me:
-I laugh a lot and am not offended easily.
-I'm white/5'5
-enjoy bowling, pool, darts, trampoline parks, live music of multiple genres, animals, random late night rides with good music...and obviously more lol
-I'm really goofy and really clutzy

If you're looking for something similar...let me know!! I'm excited for this whole thing. Please title your e-mail ""Shimmer"". Bonus points if you know what that refers to lol.

Like so many others on here looking for a connection, I'm married and not in a position to leave for all the regular reasons (Finances as a suddenly single income household, custody arrangements, young children, reputation, fear, pride, etc.) but I do know I'm looking for an emotional and potentially physical connection with a discretion-minded woman in a similar situation in the area in the hopes that it helps us both to cope with our respective situations.

I'm a normal, rather attractive, physically fit, athletic white and hispanic male. I'm tall, I have dark hair and eyes, and I'm clean and clean cut. I'm confident but not arrogant, a good listener, respectful, and very understanding and sensitive to others' needs.

To be upfront on an ideal partner in crime, I'm looking for a woman who takes care of herself, can hold a two-sided conversation or email exchange, can be discreet, and can apppreciate the dilemma of someone in a situation where divorce isn't a realistic option. Age isn't really a huge deal for me, I know most people don't hit the point I'm at until their early to mid 30s.

If you're still with me and still interested, please do reply! A discreet picture or two is always appreciated (we're all a tiny bit vain lol) but if you want to work up to it for safety reasons I totally understand. No face expected. I can of course exchange in kind. Not looking for anything extreme and I will not start off by sending you pictures of my penis. I'm just a bit classier than that, lol. I hope to hear from you!

My wife will be out again tomorrow night which leaves me home alone. I'm not upset she dates black men exactly, but The arrangement can make weekends and evenings lonely occasionally. As you might imagine, it's not like I can just bring this up at church to discuss. So I'm hoping perhaps there is someone here reading who wouldn't mind chatting with me in confidence and helping me deal with some free time this weekend. Maybe you're a white guy who is also home alone or cuckold like me, or maybe a black or African man or woman who can offer me some superior perspective on things. Maybe you're a woman who has experience dating black men, or considering cuckolding also and would like to discuss. I'm just lonely and would love a friend that I can open to and be honest with.

Well, like most friendship ad posts, I am probably looking for a unicorn, but here goes anyway. One thing I've noticed about deep friendships is that they are usually only likely with peers from similar backgrounds, so I am attempting here to give some idea of who I am -- other than ""I like shopping, going to movies, eating out."" (I mean, who doesn't?) 

With that said, I am married with grown kids. I sometimes find single women not to be compatible with me. It doesn't mean we can't be, but when someone is fervently looking for someone special, being around someone who is already attached seems to get in the way of their personal happiness. OTOH, if someone is content with their relationship status, we tend to gel as friends. Because of my situation, I have free time during the day, so I am looking for someone who also has that freedom. Like almost everyone, I have an opinion about politics, but I dislike being around people who are on either end of the political spectrum. I enjoy social drinking. I enjoy working out. I'm not interested in being someone's motivation for getting into shape, so please don't befriend me with that in mind. I tend not to get along with passive-aggressive personality types over the long term. They are too emotionally shut down to be real with. I like being active, especially with all the wonderful places/things in DC to see/do. I like occasional random texting with people who have a dry, witty sense of humor. I enjoy cooking my own meals and eating fairly healthy, although I'm not maniacal about it. (That doesn't mean I don't like to eat out sometimes.) 

I don't usually hit it off with super-touchy, easily offended types. Really, I am looking for someone who has some degree of emotional and mental strength without that tough, unyielding edge that often accompanies it, and also someone with a compassionate bent. Not that I have arrived, but these are the qualities that I cultivate in myself. Not being a religious person, I recharge by being in or thinking about nature; that is my sanctuary. If you are that unicorn, maybe we can hang out while searching for that pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. No sexual trolls, please

Are you an Exhibitionist at heart?

Do you like to show off your smooth legs wearing short skirts?

Do you like to wear low cut tops so that men notice your ample cleavage? Or do you like getting the attention of a stranger by opening your thighs when sitting across someone wearing a short dress, skirt? Or do you like showing off your delicate nothings when not a lot of people are looking?

I would love to meet a lady like this, someone who loves exhibiting her goods discretely or more obviously and gets off on the attention she gets. Maybe you're a tease who likes turning men on.. maybe its a turn on for you.

Hello. I am really not looking for sex. 

But I do have a long term fantasy of seeing a stranger (FEMALE) take off her top for me in person and showing me her breasts and nipples. I don't need to know more than her first name or maybe not even that. If she lets me touch them great but it's not a requirement. It's just a voyeuristic turn on in me. 

If you are an exhibitionist or seeking a male friend who is funny attractive and a good listener and feel open to the above I am the guy. Please send me an email telling me all about you. I am not looking for ""professionals"". It has nothing to do with spending money but it takes away part of the turn on if this is something you do for a living. It's not quite as taboo which I'm sure you can understand.

Please send a little info about yourself and what your availability might be and I can shoot some photos and info your way as well so we can get a little more of an idea of who each other are ahead of time. Definitely will appreciate a pic/phone number ahead of meeting up and I'll provide the same on my end =) If that's something you don't feel comfortable with, I totally understand, just don't want to waste anybody's time.

I'm Jaye!

First off I am a bipolar (manic-depressive) person under medical supervision who takes his meds. I am extremely self-conscious and awkward in the beginning of knowing someone but as I relax I become a great person with loads to offer. For all intents and purposes, I am pretty average I just don't leave my house much unless I have a particular place and time-specific task to accomplish. I would do more except I feel that there is no purpose for me to go out on my own; I prefer having a friend to make memories with. I would like to meet a friend for lunch, a walk through a museum, a picnic at the fountain on the national mall where you can dip your feet and legs into the water and take silly pictures. My favorite thing to do is play video games on nintendo, super nintendo, nintendo 64, nintendo gamecube, nintendo wii, and nintendo wii u (I own all these consoles); I have also recently gotten into playing games on Steam. I love television shows like Archer, Absolutely Fabulous, Charmed (especially Shannen Doherty ones), Golden Girls, Bob's Burgers, the first several seasons of South Park, Forensic Files, and various animes like Sailor Moon (original and Crystal), Zero no Tsukaima, Jigoku Shoujo, Darker than Black, Shakugan no Shana and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. I love most Disney Cartoon and Live Action movies, any of the Alien/Prometheus movies, Resident Evil movies, Harry Potter movies, Star Wars Saga, Poltergeist movies, Indiana Jones Saga, Matrix movies, and Trainwreck. 

I would like to share these interests with someone who would be interested in sharing them or discovering new things from each other. I just know myself and I will never get out there on my own and try to meet people. I feel awkward when I do which makes me awkwardly stand out as I converse with others or stand aside sampling the foods by myself feeling even more isolated. I do fine if I am with a buddy, much better than you would think given my previous statement, but I just cannot do these things on my own. I need someone to make me feel safe so I can joke and tell stories and say things like, ""No you didn't, HOW?!"" so people want to tell more in depth versions of their stories. I have spent years having no friend, acquaintances and long-distance ones sure, but I am so alone here.

I do not want to discredit my husband who I have been together with for almost 14 years (happily and definitely not looking for anything romantic by this ad I'm writing); he saved me from being a destructive version of myself and I owe my life to the love that he has given me. But husband is in another department different from friendships. And he has a very busy life, I am alone a lot and its just wearing on me as I age. I just don't know how to make friends in my condition. Its a miracle that I am with someone who loves me too.

If you want to make an awesome friend that will bring color and laughter into your life, I AM that person, I just need to bloom with the warmth of another friend that is willing to get to know me.

Please, if you can, send me a message on FB at Jaye M O'Maye, I check that more than I do email, but you want to rather email, I apologize in advance if I do not respond quickly. 

Well, I'm casting my line. Here's to hope.

I'm a 27 yr old blk male recently getting back into working out again after falling off. Finding it a little harder this time around, so I am looking for another dude to go to the gym with me from time to time to work out, share advice and help each other in our fitness journeys. I live in Pg but my gym is in silver spring. My work schedule is insane so in always in the gym at inconsistent time. Maybe early morning one day or late at night the next. Looking for another guy maybe around my age and height 6'2, but not a requirement. Race is unimportant. The only thing I ask is know your way around the gym. You don't have to be a trainer or cock diesel (but would be great if you were Lls) but at least have some kind of knowledge and be serious about fitness. I also want to take it beyond just a gym buddy but possibly develop a friendship out side of working out. Hit me up with a pic and stats and let's get it in ASAP.

I like giving slow, caring massages to make you feel good all over. I pay close attention to your body's needs. Through the bio feedback from your body to my hands, through skin contact, I adjust to where you need attention. This may mean going slower, pressing longer and holding, pushing, or being gentle.

Feeling your body relax through my touch is what I am looking for. Verbal direction is also very welcome and encouraged., whether to massage more gently, stronger, pressing and holding longer in certain areas. I hope you like what you read.

I'm not a professional. So I am not charging for these massages. Regular weekly massages are possible.

I'm in good athletic shape, attentive to your needs, and respectful.

Please be able to host. You can be single, married, or attached. Looking for women with a positive outlook on life and good hygiene. Showering before meeting is expected. I have good hygiene and you do, too. Athletes are very welcome, runners, weight lifters, crossfit, martial artist, and yoga practitioners welcome. Most importantly the every day nice woman is wanted. :) I'm athletic and understand how the body feels with exercise and can benefit from some massage, rest, good hydration and healthy food.

Thank you for reading. Please write and tell me what you are interested in, something about yourself, and where you are.

I'm real, gentle, here to care and pamper you for 60 to 90 minutes. What kind of touching and massage would feel good to you? Write and let me know. It is simple and easy.

Pairs of friends like roommates or close friends (females only) are also welcome for shorter length massages. If you're going out with your girlfriend and both of you want a massage (30-45) minutes when you get back home, I can massage both of you, one at a time of course. Both of you can talk and hangout while I massage one, then the other. Very relaxing idea.

How do women not get completely jaded with the things men say and do to attract their attention? If you're even moderately attractive you're fending off passes from men daily, and if you say something that could even remotely be construed as an opening, guys will jump on it as an invitation to hop into bed. Innuendoes abound - ""platonic full body massage"" - really??

As a guy, if I were in your shoes, I'd (i) have achy feet - don't get me started on those high heels you wear! and (ii) basically ignore men, unless I had a specific need. So tell me, ladies, how do you do it? How do you stay sane and still like us men?

Hi there, My name is Jason, and I'm relatively new to the area. I haven't had a chance to make friends in the area between my IT work and school. Yes, I still go to school. I'm always looking to advance myself whether in my personal or professional life. I'm just giving this craigslist a try to see how it works out. 

I'm a very simplistic person. I enjoy everything simple. I don't have an extravagant amount items. I drive a simple car. I watch everything on my computer instead of my TV. I like to watch everything on my computer from TV shows to movies. A lot of times I'm stuck on some pretty old shows as I may be showing my age here. My favorites are Star Trek, Stargate, Futurama, Serenity, Family Guy. My one big hobby is writing. I mostly do blogs for other companies as a side gig. I can turn a couple of words into a story. It's almost like opening a faucet that I sometimes can't stop until I conclude it. There're very few times when I run out of words, but starting is always the hardest part. Here's an excerpt: 

""Are you ever walking down the street and wonder why your shadow is always following you? If you had a flashlight at night, you could only see what you wanted to but in the daylight, everyone can see your curves, edges and ridges of your body. Looking to see what's behind you there is only the Sun casting the shadow from 93 million miles away. If people stopped and saw you for those 8 minutes from when the Sun rose they would see you as you are.""

Well, I don't want to make this too long, it's a beautiful day today and tomorrow will be even better so please don't hesitate to get in touch if I sound interesting at all!

Here's the deal- I'm still in massage school but will be completing my education in a couple weeks. I especially enjoy giving Swedish massage! It's calming and relaxing, I have lotion or jojoba oil and a massage table, and I'm all about creating atmosphere with candles (only if you are comfortable, of course!) and soothing music. 

I desperately need a haircut. It's a freshly dyed pretty purple into black, stick straight to chest length, and my split ends have split ends. I'm not asking for anything crazy- just a couple inches off the bottom in layers. Maybe bangs? If you're a hairstylist, or in school to become a hairstylist, or are magical with a comb and scissors, we should exchange our services!

If we could meet anywhere but my place, that would be ideal. One of my roommates is moving out so the place is a wreck.

I enjoy gchatting at work, texting, and emailing. Have to speed the day along some how!I love traveling, camping, going to the beach, movies, and cooking. Ideally we would hang out and stuff but can start out with email and texting. 

I am a Maryland native and own my own business. I really like Art- visual and performing. Super cliche I know, but I'm very into Musical Theater. I love being outside- hiking, camping, and exploring historical places. Down for weekend trips- anything from NYC to Williamsburg to Philly. I try to travel as much as possible. I am looking for someone who is honest, down to earth, and not a closet case trying to score a hookup. 

You don't have to be gay! I have many straight buddies. Looking for friends who are interested in hanging out in person as well! I'm smoke and drug free (occasional 420) if that matters.

You're smarter than the average student. A bookworm, perhaps. Or maybe the science type. You're not unfriendly, but most of the men in your classes seem immature to you. They don't understand your erudite fantasies, and you don't understand their crude failures at flattery.

Instead you focus your daydreams on your professors. In small seminars you keep your chin lowered, blushing quickly if your professor catches you looking at him. But in large lectures you are not so coy. Your deep intelligent eyes follow him the entire time. You laugh at his silly quips when no one else does. You linger after class to clarify a point, waiting until the other students have gone. 

I know who you are because over the past twenty years I've watched your likeness many times from my position at the front of the class. I've stared into her eyes and watched her stare back, unflinching, daring me to make a move. Hoping that I would make a move.

I don't spend personal time with my own students because of the obvious ethical considerations, but you are a stranger and have never been in any of my classes.

I'm in my mid-forties, tall, physically-fit, slender, and healthy. I can be polite, charming, and disarming in public, but I'm also strong, confident, and assertive when it counts. If you'd be interested in exploring a discreet relationship with an intellectual man, if you're willing to make some new secrets, and if the ring on my finger doesn't bother you, then I look forward to receiving your reply.

""Today's troops, tomorrow's veterans, always heroes."" Im looking to meet and become friends with our injured heroes who are currently at Walter Reed NMMC or in the surrounding area. I honor you all for selflessly enlisting to protect our country and putting your life on the line to defend our country's freedom. It's very noble and admirable. You dont have to be single to be friends with me. I just want you to know that you are greatly appreciated, even though our government doesnt, I do. I'm astonded by the lack of appreciation that Americans bestow upon our troops. Although I may not agree with the war at hand, I proudly stand behind you all!! Our troops are the reason that this country will continue to retain our freedom and the chance to see many more tomorrows. Honestly guys, It doesnt bother me if you're missing limbs, are in a wheelchair or are otherwise wounded or even if you suffer from PTSD. I am very understanding and extremely accepting, more than the average person. I am very different from every other female out there. Just give me a chance to prove it to you, I am a great person to have as a friend. You can always count on me if you ever need someone to vent to, a shoulder to cry on or to hang out with if youre lonely or bored. My boyfriend is a war veteran, he was blown up in 2005 and depends on a wheelchair for mobility. Please send a pic and some details about you with your reply, I promise I will reciprocate :) Thank you all for serving, you are greatly appreciated and HONORED. I salute you. I look forward to chatting with you and getting to know you.

Posted before and received some responses and some interesting perspectives. Would appreciate hearing from some additional guys. I moved here a couple years ago and after breaking up with my girlfriend, I've been having more and more thoughts about being with a guy as it's something I've always fantasized about. I'm still a little shy about the whole thing though. I think my dick is average but I feel more pressure about my dick size with a guy than I do with a girl and haven't had the courage to get naked yet. What is average size and does it matter? Am I over thinking it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I'm looking to hang out with someone fun and easy. I don't really have a sense of how exactly this would work but think a 'blind date' kinda set up would be fun. We could meet for a drink somewhere in DC and the if it seems like we are having a good time we can grab a bite. Basically, I would just love to be in the company of a fun relaxed woman.

I am 37 so please be around my age (not younger than 35 and older than 43). Also, please be white or Asian and have things to say. Don't really care if you are married or single. I just want to hang out. At the end of they day, I just want to make a new friend

Hi, I'm a middle aged happily divorced dad. It's been a crazy week at work. I would love lie back on my massage table and let go and just have someone touch me however they wanted and gently caress me. I'm not looking for sex, but I'm really feeling the need to be a little vulnerable and be touched. Does that make sense? I hope it doesn't sound weird or anything. You will be in control and can have fun with this opportunity however you want. No judgment from me. I am tall, only slightly hairy, not a body builder but height weight proportionate and cute enough that I get flirted with here and there. I have a high stress job and a lot of family commitments, so I have been avoiding any kind of serious relationship for a while now. Maybe you're in the same boat? I am healthy clean, employed, no criminal record, and will be showered. I will just lie down and let you, or you and a friend if that makes you feel safer, touch me and explore my body, within reasonable limits. I am happy to do the same for you, but it's not at all required. But if you are interested, I will respect your limits and do what makes you feel good in the same way that I am asking of you. I am also happy to talk about anything from what's going on in the news to science and literature and culture. I am pretty well read and can talk to and get along with just about everyone. If you're feeling like you want some human contact today without any pressure to have sex, or the overhead of starting a dating relationship, maybe this can work for you too? If the ad is still up I'm still looking. I am pretty free today and have a nice clean house to host. I am 41, but have very smooth skin and have been complemented on it by massage therapists in the past. Please say hi if you're interested and tell me a little bit about yourself. I am open to any age or body type, just be over 18 I guess :-) Peace!

Hey guys:


As long as I've been using CL, I never knew about this category. Since I have some day-time hours that aren't overly obligated right now, I'd like to share it enjoying the Spring outdoors with another outgoing, fit, easy-to-get-to-know, intelligent and attractive man.


Me? I'm 6-1, 180, 32 w/46 c, very athletically built and considered attractive 44 year-old BM, professional living in DC. I'm interested in spending outdoor time with someone of similar stats --it's what I find attractive which is why I workout myself-- preferably also masculine, who also has some weekday hours available---say a student or a professional who works from home. Walking, hiking, running, museums, galleries, even having a coffee are all possibilities.


Let's start a dialogue and find out what our mutual interests are. Please tell me about yourself, share your physical stats and perhaps a photo (I will do the same) and maybe we can be on the road to discovery while Spring is in the air.


Cheers!

Ok. Well what can I say? I work 12 hour rotating shifts (Yes. It is a pain lol) so making friends is almost as difficult as trying to schedule anything fun.

What do I like to do? Sleep! LOL but seriously. Read, Movies, Music, Travel, The Beach (I left virginia beach to come here?!?!? Had to). Watching Netflix (no cable so its all good). Eating out, Exercising, just ask really. Share your interests. Games! (Board, Video etc)

Age Range? 25+
Type? Hmm thats a tough one. I like women that are trim/fit and or athletic. Mostly because I am working on certain exercise goals, and as they say, like minded people help you attain more.
Personality? Sexy and Intelligent, but Sweet and Kind as well. A Warrior princess with a soft heart. Or a soft sweetie with a fierce inner fire ;)

Let's talk! Pictures would be nice. If not now, down the road.

Oh and if your international. Would love to learn more about cultures and such. I have traveled a bit outside of the country. Would like to do more traveling!

Want this to lead to more? Well...let's just say. I am completely Open

I don't mind if you are single, but please respect that I'm not going to go out to pick up guys. I'll go out, but I go home alone.
I love animals, enjoy video games, cuss like a sailor, love to joke and smile, laugh about weird or vulgar conversation, and I'm trying to get back into shape. 
I don't care what your color, size, religion, or whatever else could be held against you is. As long as you're honest, chill, have a personality, a sense of humor, and know I'm happily married I'm sure we'll get along :)
The only thing I have against anyone is kids. I love kids, but I don't have much to talk to people about when the talk goes to kids and I find it awkward. It's OK if you do, but I don't want it to be main topic a lot and I don't want all our time together to be distracted when we're supposed to be relaxing/hanging out.

In native American so we don't celebrate Easter but we do know of Christ and his story. In my culture we celebrate life or death (or resurrection ) by partying with the spirit.

The Greeks and Pagans had orgys and gangbangers

Hey ladies,

I'm a black woman in DC looking to be friends with women who are positive, open minded and confident within themselves. I am very much a homebody but more than normal as I've gotten older. I used to go out allot when I was younger but I'm not that person anymore. I love interior decorating and I do lots of arts & crafts and my idea of fun is enjoying my home with wine and a doobie if you know what I mean. I'm a divorced mother of 4 with shared custody so I do have time to go out. I just don't like going out and dealing with drama. I don't do night clubs and I'm not big on heels though I do love to shop just as much as any other woman. I prefer to meet women who are close to or over the age of 30, has children and not catty or bitchy because I don't do drama or arguments. One sight of drama I cut people off. I will let it be known that I don't drive because of personal reasons but I am not the friend that always needs a ride or can't get somewhere nor do I want a chauffeur. I like to laugh, pray for the people I love and just enjoy the life I've been given. If you think we would click don't be afraid to hit me up. I could care less about your race I just like genuine people. Hopefully you are the same. Looking forward to hearing from cool chicks like me soon!

Not sure if it's the weather or the water but I seem to getting very aroused of the thought of having another women and I'm not talking about a MILF or some toned gym rat but a normal women who lives a normal life that perhaps is missing some excitement and adventure. The thought of having a secret relationship with a women, who on the outside lives a wholesome cookie cutter life but behind closed doors she shares my secret. That we are lovers, that when time allows we meet even just to see each other and share a kiss, we email each other to stay in touch and when time and space allows, you let me have you. You can be married or single I'm fine with that just understand that I'm married and if you are to understand that I'm not looking to add drama or change your situation and in return you do the same.

I won't be posting any pictures for the obvious reasons but I can describe myself, 5'8, black hair, brown eyes, 180 lbs, short hair, facial hair at times and Afghan. I am dominant and I know what I want so if you are someone that keeps butting heads in life we won't get along.

You: Physically I don't have a requirement and I'm pretty open to race and age. However you have to be mentally normal. When I say normal no addictive/compulsive personality, don't be a creeper or a clinger.

I'm looking for someone to workout with me in the morning at Gold's Gym in Annandale/Springfield (though I would consider trying another gym also). I would like to try working out at 9:30am, but I have also considered going earlier. 

I'm a white male, 30's, in fairly good shape. I've lifted weights for over 20 years, but I'm recovering from some injuries, so I'm not in the best shape of my life. I like to go 5-6 days a week, but I have missed a lot of days in the past year (partly due to two injuries). 

If you're interested, please email me, and we can discuss the schedule.

I have a busy day running errands, general weekend stuff.

About me: Single AA (black) male, 5'7"", 34, living in the Aspen Hill area. I don't live far from the target area, so I expect you to be close. Looking for a female, 25 and up, (ideally between 25-40) somewhat intellectual, with a cool and laid back streak-Race doesn't matter. Just trying to see who is down for a night of drink and good conversation. Not expecting five-star dining and drinks. Going dutch at a chill lounge, restaurant bar or cafe is perfect fine with me. 

No expectations, just good company for the evening. FYI: I love good hip-hop music, poetry, good books and sports. I want to set a baseline for what we might have in common. Let's email each other, exchange pics and talk about a meet up spot in those areas. Hope to hear from you soon. Looking to meet up somewhere after 10-10:30 PM tonight and chill for a couple of hours.

I am seeking a counselor/coach type person -- female only -- and almost surely unlicensed, for discussion and dialog about relationships. But I seek a situation where you are comfortable with me being undressed, fully exposed, during our meetings and discussion. That's not allowed for licensed counselors/therapists, but unlicensed persons have more flexibility. I enjoy talking through my life issues with someone creative and empathic, and in particular am seeking relationship counseling. I am not seeking sex. But physical exposure and expression facilitates verbal revealing.

I have posted before, and have found someone very helpful to talk to, whom I do see on occasion. But I could benefit from additional dialog, and I'd prefer someone closer to home, which for me means Montgomery County. I'd prefer a location in or close to Montgomery County -- upper NW DC is okay, as is nearby PG county.

I am a single man, middle-aged. Apart from discussion about relationships and dating, you'll find that in such other conversation as naturally arises, I'm intelligent, curious, well-educated, thoughtful. I can be pretty funny at times. 

I'd prefer contacts from counselors/coaches who are at least 30 or older, though a bit younger are welcome to make contact. But generally, more experience with life and dating, and closer to my experience, is likely to work better. In deep or personal conversations, I'm usually more at ease with white or Asian women (no disrespect to others, it's just my cultural base); but I am open to women of other ethnicities making contact and seeing where the mutual comfort level is. 

If you answer, please tell me about anything that you've done that's even kind of related -- former therapists and graduate students in counseling are encouraged to reply. But really any articulate, insightful, empathic woman may be right -- a businesswoman, an academic, military, also a massage therapist, nurses, female bartenders, or even an escort (but once again I am not seeking sex here, not intercourse or oral or any such thing here) -- someone with experience in listening to people on the job, may be right for this and for me.

Along with exploring relationship issues, this sort of experience is a chance for me to feel acceptance and companionship in the company of a woman. It's necessary that you be comfortable with a naked man, but also with possible arousal. I emphasize that there would be no sex, and that the conversation and dialog and coaching are a very real part of this, and very important to me. 

If interested, write to me and I can tell you more about what I'm seeking. I will offer reasonable hourly remuneration for your counseling, coaching and listening skills, and for the environment of acceptance you create. ($50/hour, possibly more, negotiable.) Please confirm your age and also confirm that you can host. 

If you're comfortable with it, you can provide a rough indication of where you are located. I would hope, if it works out, that this would be a once or twice a month type experience, ongoing for some time. I am really seeking someone in Montgomery County, MD.

I am not seeking a ""Domme."" A real counselor, even unlicensed, is still someone whom I pay, but who builds a genuine, personal connection, in the sense of really getting to know me and wanting to help me improve my life. If the connection works, a counselor/coach really develops a genuine concern for a client, and can, in a sense, celebrate with the client whatever progress the client makes in improving the quality of his life. I am seeking the kind of human bonding, support and connection that comes from a real counselor. If you are a Domme, either in private life or professionally, you'd probably be comfortable with all this, and I'd welcome hearing from you; but I am not seeking that side of your personality (nor your dungeon space).

Hello there,
I just moved to the Centreville area, and would like to try and meet some new people. My roommate is going to be out of town tomorrow and I was planning on making a pretty awesome dinner before watching ""The Walking Dead"". I am open to inviting YOU to come over for dinner and to watch the show with me, if you are a friendly, down to earth person who doesn't mind meeting new people. 
I know it is a little odd to invite someone to your home from, Craigslist but we can exchange pics and talk beforehand, as hopefully this would be a friendship and we could watch future episodes together, and who knows. . .. . ... Maybe go on dinner dates, bowling, or movies together. 
Although I am not currently in a relationship, I am not thinking about that with this posting. I am just hoping to meet a new person who wants to make new friends, and also enjoys fun things like ""The Walking Dead"". 
BTW I was planning on making Shrimp fajitas w/ sautĂŠed onion and bell peppers, black beans and shredded jack cheese. Pretty awesome. . .. . ... 
I would want to talk first and trade pics. All the best

With that being said, i love Happy hour, Bottomless brunches, trying out new restaurants etc. Im not the clubbing type, so if you are, we probably wont mix well, im just looking for someone who is down for a fun time.

Why is making friends so difficult as an adult? Sheeesh. Not looking to braid each other's hair every weekend, just someone to hang out with who wants a genuine friendship. 

Let's get right into it:

This is what I like... 
-Cooking/baking/trying new recipes
-Just hanging out! Don't need to do anything extravagant. Just go over a friend's house, talk, watch a movie, etc
-Anything crafty
-Going to the movies
-Seeing new places/taking pictures *working on getting a professional camera soon :) 

If you like doing any of that, shoot me a message. But I will be straight forward, I don't like to force things at all. So, if it's not the right fit for you, no hard feelings, just do the courtesy of letting me know. Also, I am not looking for a relationship or anything beyond friendship. I am straight, and in a long term relationship.

WE are a COUPLE! Seeking a woman whom is interested in exploring some fun experiences with US TOGETHER... 

Looking to have my first experience with a female AND in a threeplay with the right female playmate... We are seeking chemistry, connection, and a female whom will be comfortable with US!

Seeking these qualities for this with a female:

Non-Smoker
Social Drinking acceptable
No Drug Use
DD Free
Athletic and/or physically fit
Clean and takes care of appearance
Caucasian preferred, however females are considered if both of us agree to engagement...

Mutual chemistry, connection and attraction are important with engagement...

If chosen, YOU will be my first in this to fulfill my fantasy in double... It is important that all things fall into place and have a great time in the making :) ... You should be adventurous as we are looking for a third for preferably ongoing experiences...

About him... a lethal combination of tall, handsome, and sexy...
About her... a ginger with personality, beauty, and sexy to boot...

Both of us are Professional, very Good Looking, Athletic, DD Free, Non-smokers, Drinks Socially, and DO NOT Use/Do Drugs...

Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement... 

PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING WHEN RESPONDING: We expect to email, chat, exchange pics and speak on the phone prior to meeting... (photo and general information will be inquired to get to know you personally)...

SERIOUS INTEREST and INQUIRIES ONLY!!!... NO MALES... NO DRAMA.... NO DISINGENUOUS REPLIES!!!

FURTHERMORE: Not looking to engage in convo that leads to a dead end, meaning that no progression is made so we can see were this might lead! Meeting socially to see if we have connection/chemistry with casual conversation, interaction and if we do we can go from there. If we do connect, great! If we don't, we can part ways respectfully... 

This could lead to an ongoing friendship and possibly more, but if it only ends up in one or more fun evenings out, that would be great too...

IN RECAP: Discretion and privacy included... 
Selective and particular with engagement (photo and some general information will be requested to get to know you personally)...

SERIOUS INTEREST AND INQUIRIES ONLY!... NO MALES. NO DRAMA....

So if you are interested in being a playmate or even possibly part of a triad let us know. Please put ""Respectfully Yours"" in the subject line, include pics, experience, desires and expectations... Please feel free to reply to this email or Kik us if interested: my handle is VenusVegas...

I am 28, WM, athletic, who is looking for someone to walk/jog with around the neighborhoods. I have recently recovered from a knee injury, and am now getting back into exercising after about a six months off. I have gotten back into things pretty easily, but would love to have a partner. Someone to help push me, and nice to talk to. Ideally you would be someone who is starting over as well, or be willing to work with me. Please be able and willing to progress at a fair/nice pace. I would like us to push each other to do better, but no drill sergeants. I would like to keep this easy-going, especially until we feel each other out. Just walking/jogging for now. If we hit it off then we can expand on our training.

The main times I am open are Wednesday and Thursday evenings, some Fridays depending on plans. This relationship would be platonic, just workout buddies. Your status/age/race does not matter to me, just be willing to work out and keep me company. Just be nice!

Please be local to the Gainesville/Bristow area or close. Hope to hear from you.

Hey guys:


As long as I've been using CL, I never knew about this category. Since I have some day-time hours that aren't overly obligated right now, I'd like to share it enjoying the Spring outdoors with another outgoing, fit, easy-to-get-to-know, intelligent and attractive man.


Me? I'm 6-1, 180, 32 w/46 c, very athletically built and considered attractive 44 year-old BM, professional living in DC. I'm interested in spending outdoor time with someone of similar stats --it's what I find attractive which is why I workout myself-- preferably also masculine, who also has some weekday hours available---say a student or a professional who works from home. Walking, hiking, running, museums, galleries, even having a coffee are all possibilities.




Let's start a dialogue and find out what our mutual interests are. Please tell me about yourself, share your physical stats and perhaps a photo (I will do the same) and maybe we can be on the road to discovery while Spring is in the air.


Cheers!

I love sports.. both watching and playing. I play basketball, softball, volleyball, football, etc. 
I enjoy going to the movies, going to the river, shooting range, drinking wine, going on walks or hikes and I love the beach !! 
I also have a motorcycle and would be great to meet someone that likes to ride also 
I am NOT looking for sex!! I really just want to make friends.

In need of some career guidance/friendship/new opportunity and am feeling pretty lost.

Would love to meet up with someone successful who either has a job opportunity or a solid lead/advice on career switches.

Me: 29, gainfully employed in the same career for 8 years currently making $55,000 with very little room for growth (think social work). I want to completely get out of that sector and move into something like corporate training, real estate, medical sales, PR/HR etc, etc. Not interested in a scam, get rich quick scheme, or anything that is 100% commission based.

Skills: I am eager to make a a change, fast learner, great researcher, extremely outgoing and personable, warm, smartish (2 undergrade degrees, no master's yet!), well-read, realistic, hardworking, punctual, organized, and reliable. I am happy talking in front of strangers, can work independently under time sensitive deadlines and pressure, and am anticipatory/problem solver. I'm good with kids and demanding personalities and have patience in spades. I'm high energy and active and would love to travel. I'm well put together, fit, and decently attractive (ugh, I hate that that matters in some fields, but I also said I was realistic). In my free time, I travel, volunteer, hike, do yoga, and cook/bake. I have no criminal record, have never been fired, have a driver's license and a car. 

Bad quality- I haven't made the leap on my own because although my job is dead-end, it's secure and that's important to me. It's just me- no rich parents to fall back on and no real safety net. My family is blue collar and I'm the first one in my family to attend college. 

You: Although I am single, I'm not looking for a romantic or sexual relationship so your marital status and age does not matter. I'm looking for a mentor or friendship with someone who wants to take a chance/give back/believes in karma or helping out someone who has never really had a lucky bone in her body!

Please- no shady business ventures, no escort/massage/web cam offers, and not searching for an internet pen pal. 

Thank you for your serious replies and your time! Looking forward to hearing from you!

So a long time ago (~6 months) I had a great hiking buddy, we'd devour Billy Goat and other trails multiple times a year. We were on the same page, both laid back, just wanted to enjoy nature, etc. Said hiking buddy decided to go get himself a girlfriend and a full-time travel job, so now the weekends are exclusively for the girlfriend.

After many failed attempts at converting my robotic urban rat friends into happy nature squirrels, I decided to look elsewhere. So, here I am. And this is what I seek:

- Hiking/Activity Buddy
- Age/Race/Status unimportant
- Also getting back into running (slowly)
- Open to other nature/outdoors activities (wineries, camping, exploring DC)

Stats:
- 37/m/6'0
- Fairly good shape
- Laid back

I realize this endeavor has about as much a chance of success as my getting a job at Hooters (these A-minuses I'm rocking are clearly not going to blow anyone's doors off. . .or anything else, for that matter), but, well, worth a shot, right? I mean, it IS Craigslist. . .there are weirdos on here. Like me.

So, what brings me into this den of interweb weirdos? There's no way to say this without sounding douchey, so I'll just say it douchily (that's a word, right?): I need a cuddle. And I'm married.

Yes, I should theoretically get all the cuddling I need at home. But, sadly, circumstances in life seem to be conspiring against that happening, and it's been a long time (years?) since cuddling for the sake of cuddling happened, without all of the attendant pressures and stresses of life intruding on the moment. And I miss that. I miss what it feels like to just get lost in the moment snuggling with someone, feeling them pressed against you, smelling the scent of their hair, just reveling in being close and connected. 

I know what you're thinking--""Hey, dirty old married guy. . .you really just want skeezy sex, but are trying to disguise it as something innocent."" That's what I'd be thinking, too, if I were you. I assure you I'm not, but this is CL, and there are weirdos (like me), so why would you believe me?
Hmm. This may be an insurmountable obstacle. Nonetheless, let's press forward. All of you who are no longer reading might be interested. Or not. Since you're no longer reading.

I'm a 36-year-old white professional with brown hair and blue eyes; 5'9""; 150 pounds; generally pretty good smelling. Pretty good at cuddling (by my own reckoning, at least. . .perhaps that doesn't qualify as a ringing third-party endorsement). And I really want to just get lost, if even for an hour, in being close to someone, snuggling with someone, spooning, holding, etc. Life has been incredibly stressful lately, and that sort of contact sounds so relaxing, so amazingly therapeutic. . .sigh.

I know there are services for this sort of thing, and I've inquired, but haven't had any luck finding anyone who's schedule is compatible or who's close enough to make it work. And, it seems weird to pay for that sort of thing (not that I'm opposed to it), as it feels much better when the other person is just as eager to hold and be held. 

So, what am I looking for? Someone who wants the same thing (I should say a lady who wants the same thing. . .sorry, gents; nothing personal). Someone who's ideally available during the day and can host our snuggling. Someone who has a good sense of humor and will look at this the same way I do: a therapeutic modality that will give us both an escape from the stress of life for a little bit, and a chance connect with someone. 

I realize there's exactly 0 people out there who will fit that description, but there's always hope, right? Let me sweeten the pot: I WILL BRING COOKIES! Or whatever baked good tickles your pickle boat (is that a thing?). How can you say no to THAT? 

We could always meet for coffee or something beforehand, too, just to see if we feel like we want to proceed. Snuggling is intimate, and it might be weird to just show up and say, ""Hey, nice to meet you, little spoon! Get over here!""

If that sounds remotely interesting, I'd love to hear from you. . .I shan't hold my breath, though, as I'm not very good at that anyway. ;)

(Oh, and for those wondering...I really just do mean cookies. Apparently, as I've learned somewhat awkwardly, that word can mean something else on CL...)

Like the title says I am married and in a sexually unfulfilling relationship. Not looking to end my marriage or Bing any drama into your life, but more so looking for someone to actually connect with and form something beyond just sex.

A little about me, I am 30 years old, white, 6ft tall and stay active in the gym one to two times a day. I can't think of a day that I have had where I have felt wanted by someone else and just really miss that feeling of excitement and getting to know someone new that doesn't mind me being married.

Ideally I would like to find someone that is just as physically active as I am and enjoys staying in shape. Race isn't in issue for me and I would love to find a single girl that wouldn't mind being my friend, but expect that I would connect better with another married woman that is just as unfulfilled as me.

If anything you have read piques' your interest and you would like to get to know me please feel free to message me, but put ""Secret Friends"" in the subject so I know your not spam! 

You can also hit me up on kik, davtra26. Please include a picture with all responses.

Some of the questions are going to be intimate, personal, and sexual. If you are not comfortable with it you can stop right here. The questions are random and in no particular order.

How often do you get yourself off? 
Married? Single? Divorced? Separated? Something else? 
Shaved, trimmed, or natural?

Drink? Smoke? Drugs? 
What kind/color/style of panties you have on right now? 
Kids? Got any? Want any? 
How long is your hair?

Good Morning,
The weather is starting to warm up and summer adventures are just around the corner. I figured it was a good time to start looking for new friends. I've been separated from my wife for a few months now, but still not really looking for a romantic relationship. Just someone whose fun to be around, easy to talk to hopefully, and either shares some interests or is willing to teach/learn new ones. 
Not sure why people always seem to ask these questions but figure I'll save us both some time and answer them up front.
Me:
Ethnicity: Mixed White/Filipino
Employment : Fulltime+ . I can pay my own way. 
I enjoy hiking, biking, or pretty much anything outdoors. Taking an intro to outdoor rock climbing class this weekend, weather permitting. I'm a big fan of going to the movies, playing pool (badly), or trying new stuff. Given my preference though I like doing things at home over going to a bar. I like board games, or watching Netflix (No Chill. Sorry ladies) with my pup. I prefer to cook over going to a restaurant, because I can usually make it better than they do anyway. I go to the gym a couple times a week and usually enjoy anything physical. I don't want to seem egotistical so I'll keep this brief, if you have questions feel free to ask. I'm an honesty first kind of person. If any of that sounds like your cup of tea, email me and we'll see where it goes. 
Thank you for your time,
~C

I am becoming dangerous for myself - twice since October falling in love for women who turned out to be the opposite of what they seemed in the beginning. When I noticed that the attitude of the latest one - a beautiful lady from Ukraine whom I visited in her country - is wrong and things became tense, I honestly broke with her. But now I wish I have been more sneaky. Because she lives now in my every body cell and I wait for her skype message or email like a hungry dog waiting for food. She is a very special corrupt girl, from Ukrainian mafia circles, not kind at all and not a friend, let alone a life partner. But the sweetness of her touch, her loneliness, her accommodating sexual energy, the sounds and moves of her orgasms, her silver laughter, her occasionally very caring ways, her tears when I was leaving - they still haunt me. I wish I minimized the wrong relationship instead of destroying it. What can I do? Wait it out? Replace with another fire? Meet a real friend who will heal all wounds? We shall see. Thanks for reading this rant.

I am a married Black man with four children and a beautiful wife. For the past few weeks my wife have been acting distance from everyone. I asked her was she ok, was it something at work or did I do something? Her response was no we were fine. With this weekend being a holiday my wife and our two daughters went to get their hair and nails done. Well, she left her cell phone in our bedroom. Yes, I was hesitant but I looked to see if I could find any clues to why she is acting so distance. There it is, the same phone number, text, a picture and his name, Keith. I had to literally sit down and pray to God for self control. About 30 minutes later I called the number, he answered I confirmed the number, the name and asked him why he was having any dealings with my wife. He was more concerned who I was and laughing throughout the whole short conversation. He then told me his d--k is giving her what she want, and he can and will continue to f--- my and anyone else wife. He then asked what man looks through his wife phone I told him a God fearing man who loves and want to keep his wife. Again, he and his boys in the background was laughing and repeated about his d---. Was I wrong? Please tell me what would you have done and still do? When she got in last night I told her what I did and what happen. She deleted all of his information and told me it was more booty calls he have nothing to offer her. I have a six figure job in the government, a beautiful home, cars and our children get the best education. Then why even bother him? What would you really do?

I struggle with this everyday. Some are worse but it's always bad. I strongly dislike my wife's son. He is everything I dislike in a human. He is an adult, knows everything, can't keep a job, can't keep off the pot, doesn't respect our country, can't pick up after himself. Has been in and out of the house for the past couple years. When I moved in he literally showed up 3 days later. Oh yeah. He's the type of person if you try and be nice to him he takes that as he can just be lazier. Of course his mother recognizes this but she is his biggest protector of all things evil haha me. I just don't think I can deal with this anymore. I just want to escape to normalcy.

I know this seems like an odd posting, but looking for a new friend who could possibly be a roommate/landlord in the future. I'd just prefer not moving in with a complete stranger hence the ""friends first."" I'm a 31 year old night nurse, so we likely won't have much interaction time except on my off days unless you also work nights or work from home. I have somewhat introverted and reserved exterior, but really easy-going and silly with the right energies. I'm very open-minded and non-traditional in many ways and open to any number of mutually agreed upon living arrangements as long as we are both respectful and mature about it. Very important that you are open to having dogs because I plan on adopting an adult dog (prob a boxer/cane corso/argentine dogo/american bull dog type/mix...leaning more towards a boxer though) shortly after the move, no pets allowed on current lease :( . My lease does not end until September and I'm willing to pay up to $1000 for a room (utilities included). Open to many areas in the DMV areas, but must be metro accessible. 

On my off days I enjoy being outdoors hiking, biking (oh yeah, will need space to store my bike), and tennis (but it's sadly been a while), random scenic drives and road/field trips/adventures, outdoor movies ...would be kinda cool to have a partner in crime. Not into the club or party scene though. Let me know if you have any questions and what type of living space/arrangement you have to offer. Never too soon to make a new friend even if the roomie situation doesn't pan out.

Please introduce yourself rather than a one liner or simply asking for pics.

So I figured I'd come on CL and try my hand at this ""strictly plantonic"" thing. See, I'm too broke to date. But I'm talented, fit, funny, witty and handsome enough for friends. I have lots of ordinary friends. I just want one that's out-of-my-leagues-type pretty now. You know, a friend that would make a guy dream and aspire to be rich enough to afford dating again. 

Here's the blueprint...

- First we start off with these emails. 
- If we click as short term pen pals and make it to texting and stuff, we might as well meet up some place meet-and-greetish but not quite dateish, i.e. Starbucks or Northside Social. 
- If you laugh at my jokes, I will call you again and we can do something we both think is actually fun. 
- We will officially be friends! 
- By then my new full time job would have come through and I would randomly ask you out on a date, romantic and worthy enough to get myself up and out of the friend zone.

I think my plan is perfect and fail proof. If you agree, send me an email before another local, hot, fit, sensible and witty, single girl looking for a cool friend like me, beats you to it.

I think everyone needs a friend and confidant sometimes. Someone to see and accept them just as they are. I can be that friend. I'm here to provide daily inspiration, encouragement, and empowerment. Whether you simply need someone you can trust and talk to or you desire honest feedback, I'm here.

Stop holding on to things that you feel you can't share without judgement. Stop carrying things that no longer serve you. When everything else seems so tough, and no one else seems to understand, let me be your soft place to land.

There is no charge for this. I just want to be a friend to someone who needs it and a conduit for abundant kindness and love :)

I'm a tall West African Dude, fit built. I'm not the most handsome dude out there but still aint the worst you can find..... Yea I now that's a hell of a way to start an introduction.

If you are not foreign or Spanish speaking please disregard this message. The sole purpose of this ad is to find a Spanish speaking woman for us to conversate. I'm looking to better my Spanish skills. If you are also looking to do that or develop your French we could have a great win win situation.

Busco una persona que habla espanol para practicar y para hacer actividas.

If you are also looking for a buddy or activity partner feel free to contact me. I consider myself a reasonably active person and we could therefore do much together.

read to very end because there is a code word to use so I know your not some scum trying to scam..

Ok so here it goes... not physically but mentally single for a while and thought I would try to see what's out there. Im going to get this out in the open so I eliminate all those gold diggers out there. My last relationship was a DISASTER, worse ever.. and she lied about everything who she was including her age from the first email-red flag yeah I should have ended it there but i'll take the heat. came to point that she said I couldn't afford her, and that she never paid rent and will not pay now. She promised to pay for her girls bedroom set I got for her 2 girls and didn't, she didn't offer or help with rent, utilities, even paying for small things such as toiletries or house hold needs such as paper towels, it was so ridiculous now that I got rid of her and evicted from my home. THIS CANNOT BE YOU!!!! YOU HAVE TO BE BETTER THAN THIS DEPENDENT ETHIOPIAN who preys on guys to pay her bills and get her through life in exchange for ""services"". Unfortunately she is good at convincing and I fell in love, I tried to change her, I tried to be compassionate and get her away from that but she is just that type and always will be.... Ok well im not the type that needs time to ""heal"" I been healing for last year and need someone to take my mind off her and the past. Here's the ironic part, this is ALMOST the same post I posted 18 months ago when she responded and told me how she was different, and not like my ex, and would treat me like I deserve, and blah blah.. So now I hear all the time about how men lie to women, is it really that bad that women do the same thing to guys who are legitimately taking it serious???? Anyway that was technically a rhetorical question. So moving on I am hoping to find someone to get my mind at ease, ,who knows 3rd time charm?? Or is all women bipolar, self absorbent, gold diggers? lol, ok another rhetorical question, however if you read this far and it turns you off then that is EXACTLY what im hoping for because it wont happen again and save both of us the time if this resembles you. I miss being with someone and can hardly sleep because im always thinking about her. Movies, going out, Learning how to dance, gazing stars, roaming mall, I don't know. I also miss being next to a woman so if you just want to curl up on couch and watch movie that's fine to. I have my own home, my own car and job/money and don't need yours just so we are on same page. I am on here for a friend status but what happens happens, and things do happen and develop. On that note I am more attractive to physically fit hwp people. Its just huge turn on for me to have someone who cares about their body as Im physically in shape myself. But hold on... some women who are a little bit ""bigger"" actually are hot and pull it off well and just as if not more attractive... But If you are obviously on the ""BIG"" side and you know what I mean and have some issues in that area that is ok we can still be friends. IF we hit it off you can sleep over, whatever happens happens. I am open to race and age within reason. Also Im very keen on clean house the Ethiopian wasn't she was very dirty person, You do not have to be white glove clean but come on, keep it fairly tidy. 
I am mid 30s white male, 195lbs physically fit, 6'5"", blonde hair and blue eyes. I can be an ass but I can be a very sweet guy if treated right. I have always pretty much been in long term relationships so that should say something about that. I am on the shy side and I am not comfortable with bars/clubs BUT im hoping to find someone to change that and show me what I been missing. Take me by the hand and lead me into happiness with them. Im sarcastic, im not a sports fan really but Im more into playing than watching or following a favorite team. I play guitar and I am trying to find someone to teach me to dance like salsa or anything. So perhaps you are looking for the same. I have more interest but i'll leave that for future conversations and leave the mystery there. 
I have pics but I have a rule, if you want a pic you have to send one first no exceptions. I find that when I send one I don't get one back at times for whatever reason. I send one back no matter what. IF that's something you cant do then we can just talk until you feel comfortable doing so.

So if you read this to the end start by letting me know your favorite color otherwise your spam, and yes 99% of the people on this is SPAM.. Sad but if your not 100% born female it wont work and don't bother because you wont like what I have to say to you.

I updated this below because of confused guys still trying to hit on me believing I am playing ""hard to get"" as a ""closeted"" guy....What the fuck is wrong with you??? its 2016 for god fucking sake, who the fuck is closeted in this day?? If you do not know what platonic is...BACK THE FUCK UP AND CLICK THE BACK BUTTON before your rainbow gets crushed. Excuse the grammar and way I put some things into words being anti-social, OCD, mixed with little ADHD (yeah I don't believe all that medical jumbo just what a lot of people tell me I have.(rolls eyes.), im in hurry and If your going to judge based on how I write we wouldn't get alone very well. IF this post offends you then it did its job to make you move on away from socializing with me. All you others who get it,, welcome to the club. 

Ok, to start lets say I am 100% straight, love my women and always will be..if you get what im saying then we will be just fine(some don't get it) moving on...well I just got done with a very bad relationship so seeking something that im not even sure yet(100% STRAIGHT for you freaks that don't get it) Im not even sure if this will work because I don't hang with guys because I usually don't have same interest as they do. I mean what do guys do anyway when they are together? I have pretty much only hung out with females or my relationships/kids. go to work, come home... get on computer/watch some tv, go to gym.. work on my business,etc. 
I always been loner, never going out, always home body, always working(construction/own business) I don't do social things, I'm not sociable person... all my relationships have been online found. so how do I meet girls in streets? I desire someone to talk to to go out with, to connect to. Someone who I can share interest.. That's where you come in..I don't know how to find them, I been on craigslist but all scammers or ones that are real doesn't seem peak interest either me them, or them me. I want to hit the gym again, im not out of shape but need toned, im 37 6'5"", 195.. white male blond hair blue eyes, physically fit. Age really doesn't' matter man, I mean if your 18 or if your 50.. I mean your a male, im not seeking a mate. And for you idiots that wrote me saying im closeted, you have no freakin idea what your talking about and your the exact type of person I don't want to hang around because you think a guy hanging with a guy is a fucking invitation that they want you sexually. What part of its FUCKING DISGUSTING do you not understand. Why are you even writing me if my post offends you. Just because I accept gay life and Im ok with hanging around you/them does NOT MEAN I SWING THAT WAY. its 2016 and I am very comfortable in my sexuality so don't flatter yourself. If my pictures that I am posting sends some sort of gay radar to you then you need to fine tune your adjustments because they ARE PICTURES! I am NOT NAKED, I nowhere in my pictures show anything seductive for the male race. If a drill in a guys hands turns you on then you have problems that I can't even comprehend. I don't care if your straight or gay, but if your gay you can compliment me on a social level, call me cute if it makes you feel better, fine.. .BUT DO NOT TOUCH ME or try to change my strong feelings for women. Note although I am not against gays but I think its disgusting so if you can cope with how I feel about that then we understand each other. Don't hug me, definitely do not kiss me because you will get jacked in the face. I have posted about 2 years ago this similar post and the stupid gay guys trying to date me is repulsive, it puts a bad taste in my mouth about how gays are. So if you are gay and your really interested in friendship or whatever you call it don't make your way of life look bad by hitting on me. Oh yeah guess I should say no I will NOT WATCH PORN WITH YOU(I will watch porn with a woman, but NOT YOU)!, I WILL NOT EVER BE NAKED AROUND YOU! its sad I have to say that but those was the other 2 sick things that was pushed on me. And no I do not believe that guys who are naked together ""chilling"" or watching porn is straight, they are not open or bi then they are definitely closeted gays. Transvestites this also applies to you, if your not 100% born female with all the parts its not going to happen. Gays and trannys I respect you for you as a person but not your lifestyle. Im here for you as a person NOT your lifestyle.. You want to talk to me about guys you want to date or think is cute, hey im fine with that. 
What to do?? golf, play pool, bowling, maybe some basketball or soccer perhaps. I am into MMA, although I have not been able to physically get into it for long time, I studied martial arts in past. Also boxing, running, maybe wrestling as well.. You know the things that barbaric guys do. Again I am not experienced with this but would entertain it under right circumstances. I might be open to bar/club(seeking women) we can do gym, we can hang out, we can talk or whatever. I don't really play video games but if time allowed might try it. I do like guitar hero and rock band but been while, think because I do like to dabble with guitar and drums and am trying the keyboard/piano so if you are any experience in a musical instrument that would be common interest. I also want to learn how to sing and dance, so if that's something your into then im game. I am not from here, im from Missouri and I never had guy friends. I always hung with females but thought give try. I don't know I just never seemed to really be interested in same things as others. Im not sport fanatic, I don't give 2 cents about the superbowl although I did watch it with my son this year for first time ever, unfortunately the panthers lost. I would much rather be playing than sitting on couch watching others do it. I don't really do much socially. I work a lot and when you work a lot you don't have time for others. I also have 2 boys full time and sole custody and reason im trying to find mother figure for them as well or someone to accept them. 
.. I am not sure about the other side, the social side because never had opportunity due to being shy side and I have always been in relationship but now I decided not to get into another one leaving my only priorities are my sons and my work at this time.. So possibilities are limitless, I have been to very few clubs(once a gay club, long story but it was something I never experienced in my life)Ia don't really do bars... but would entertain something that would be a positive influence especially if I was to meet a nice good looking fit woman.

I'm just looking for a girl around my age or even a little older to hang out with and go on walks, drives and generally someone to talk to about life and it's many shenanigans. Someone that might be an introvert and wants to get out of their shell would be good too cause at least then we'd have something in common to start talking about. If this interest you hmu and let's chat we can exchange pictures to see who it is we're talking to if you're comfortable enough.

Good day :)

It's that time of year where sitting inside all day is tough. I've been getting out in the afternoon and finding a new place to walk and explore some. I've found a few places that may be good candidates to re-visit. Places with a lake or historical sites typically are best. 

In the spirit of full disclosure - I am married, 46, Caucasian, 6' and ~185lbs.. can share a pict if you like as well.

Good Morning,
The weather is starting to warm up and summer adventures are just around the corner. I figured it was a good time to start looking for new friends. I've been separated from my wife for a few months now, but still not really looking for a romantic relationship. Just someone whose fun to be around, easy to talk to hopefully, and either shares some interests or is willing to teach/learn new ones. 
Not sure why people always seem to ask these questions but figure I'll save us both some time and answer them up front.
Me:
Ethnicity: Mixed White/Filipino
Employment : Fulltime+ . I can pay my own way. 
I enjoy hiking, biking, or pretty much anything outdoors. Taking an intro to outdoor rock climbing class this weekend, weather permitting. I'm a big fan of going to the movies, playing pool (badly), or trying new stuff. Given my preference though I like doing things at home over going to a bar. I like board games, or watching Netflix (No Chill. Sorry ladies) with my pup. I prefer to cook over going to a restaurant, because I can usually make it better than they do anyway. I go to the gym a couple times a week and usually enjoy anything physical. I don't want to seem egotistical so I'll keep this brief, if you have questions feel free to ask. I'm an honesty first kind of person. If any of that sounds like your cup of tea, email me and we'll see where it goes. 
Thank you for your time,
~C

I really wonder if it is possible. I know I am looking for friendship. Maybe that turns into a friend I end up loving? I love lots of my friends-in a platonic way. But maybe this friend can share the passion of man on man sex or the intimacy of male bonding between two married dads who have little time for themselves anymore. I am out to my wife and actually losing my best friend (who I am not out to) to a job in another city. Both of those things lead me to the weird place of trying to make friends with dudes in my forties. It's a little rough. But I've tried. I'm not looking for just sex (a little man on man stuff can't hurt though) and I have connected with a couple of guys (non sexually.) One guy is awesome-and only here temporarily. Another completely lied about where he was in his journey and revealed himself as truly broken and in a pattern of self destructive behaviors. I'm curious if I keep trying to meet guys I will find the right friend. A guy to go have drinks or beers with. A guy to hike with. A guy who is a dad with dad experience and questions. A guy who loves his wife and the occasional dick. A guy with integrity who isn't afraid to hug another guy-or get close. I'm really interested to see what response there is to this. Spare any lectures. And please no 'sup bros. I think you would have to at least be 32 but younger than 55. And married. With a kid or kids. And fun. Maybe hot? Like to cook? Occasional ball game. Stable job that you like. Some artistic outlet. Oh-you have to love women. That really matters. And be real. Ready to let your guard down and grow with a friend in a meaningful way (and I now sound like a pussy.) Maybe you exist? Maybe this makes sense? Maybe no sex is involved? Who knows? What do you think?

I desire someone to talk to to go out with, to connect to. Someone who I can share interest.. That's where you come in..I don't know how to find them, I been on craigslist but all scammers or ones that are real doesn't seem peak interest either me them, or them me. I want to hit the gym again, im not out of shape but need toned, im 37 6'5"", 195.. white male blond hair blue eyes, physically fit. Age really doesn't' matter man, I mean if your 18 or if your 50.. I mean your a male, im not seeking a mate. And for you idiots that wrote me saying im closeted, you have no freakin idea what your talking about and your the exact type of person I don't want to hang around because you think a guy hanging with a guy is a fucking invitation that they want you sexually. What part of its FUCKING DISGUSTING do you not understand. Why are you even writing me if my post offends you. Just because I accept gay life and Im ok with hanging around you/them does NOT MEAN I SWING THAT WAY. its 2016 and I am very comfortable in my sexuality so don't flatter yourself. If my pictures that I am posting sends some sort of gay radar to you then you need to fine tune your adjustments because they ARE PICTURES! I am NOT NAKED, I nowhere in my pictures show anything seductive for the male race. If a drill in a guys hands turns you on then you have problems that I can't even comprehend. I don't care if your straight or gay, but if your gay you can compliment me on a social level, call me cute if it makes you feel better, fine.. .BUT DO NOT TOUCH ME or try to change my strong feelings for women. Note although I am not against gays but I think its disgusting so if you can cope with how I feel about that then we understand each other. Don't hug me, definitely do not kiss me because you will get jacked in the face. I have posted about 2 years ago this similar post and the stupid gay guys trying to date me is repulsive, it puts a bad taste in my mouth about how gays are. So if you are gay and your really interested in friendship or whatever you call it don't make your way of life look bad by hitting on me. Oh yeah guess I should say no I will NOT WATCH PORN WITH YOU(I will watch porn with a woman, but NOT YOU)!, I WILL NOT EVER BE NAKED AROUND YOU! its sad I have to say that but those was the other 2 sick things that was pushed on me. And no I do not believe that guys who are naked together ""chilling"" or watching porn is straight, they are not open or bi then they are definitely closeted gays. Transvestites this also applies to you, if your not 100% born female with all the parts its not going to happen. Gays and trannys I respect you for you as a person but not your lifestyle. Im here for you as a person NOT your lifestyle.. You want to talk to me about guys you want to date or think is cute, hey im fine with that. 
What to do?? golf, play pool, bowling, maybe some basketball or soccer perhaps. I am into MMA, although I have not been able to physically get into it for long time, I studied martial arts in past. Also boxing, running, maybe wrestling as well.. You know the things that barbaric guys do. Again I am not experienced with this but would entertain it under right circumstances. I might be open to bar/club(seeking women) we can do gym, we can hang out, we can talk or whatever. I don't really play video games but if time allowed might try it. I do like guitar hero and rock band but been while, think because I do like to dabble with guitar and drums and am trying the keyboard/piano so if you are any experience in a musical instrument that would be common interest. I also want to learn how to sing and dance, so if that's something your into then im game. I am not from here, im from Missouri and I never had guy friends. I always hung with females but thought give try. I don't know I just never seemed to really be interested in same things as others. Im not sport fanatic, I don't give 2 cents about the superbowl although I did watch it with my son this year for first time ever, unfortunately the panthers lost. I would much rather be playing than sitting on couch watching others do it. I don't really do much socially. I work a lot and when you work a lot you don't have time for others. I also have 2 boys full time and sole custody and reason im trying to find mother figure for them as well or someone to accept them. 
.. I am not sure about the other side, the social side because never had opportunity due to being shy side and I have always been in relationship but now I decided not to get into another one leaving my only priorities are my sons and my work at this time.. So possibilities are limitless, I have been to very few clubs(once a gay club, long story but it was something I never experienced in my life)Ia don't really do bars... but would entertain something that would be a positive influence especially if I was to meet a nice good looking fit woman.

Hey

I just moved to the area from LA last Saturday and I don't know many people. I work in Fairfax and currently am house hunting for a place in but staying in Silver Spring, MD.

I've had a long week already and was wondering if someone just wanted to get together for something low key like drinks, dinner, maybe a movie or just talk about whatever. I just want to spend time with someone outside of work. I'm willing to come to wherever you are and may even treat. Remember, this is platonic only. 

Hope to meet you.

Attractive, active, 24-year-old female looking for a respectable man to pay for my second-degree, bills/living expenses, perhaps a car (used is fine), and other miscellaneous expenses (gym membership, occasional shopping trips, dinner/beer dates). Respectable, meaning: a gentleman, intellectual (philosophical and/or spiritual), and generous.

Disclaimer: I'm not seeking someone who is simply rich, nor am I seeking someone to exchange money for sexual favors - I'd like to be with someone I could potentially come to love, so conversational and personal compatibility is also something I'm looking for. Age does not matter.

Email me with some personal details (however much you want to share is your prerogative). If we can start up a fair conversation (i.e. I don't think you're too creepy), then we can meet up in person and go from there. Pictures are a bonus.

Trying to meet someone on CL has become like finding a needle in a haystack. It shouldn't be so difficult.

I think I have many of the traits that women look for here. I'm honest and sincere; passionate, loving, and caring; kind, friendly, and loyal; independent, intelligent, and attractive; a non-smoker, very light drinker, and D/D free; with a good sense of humor. That all sounds good, right???

However, when I respond to ads, I often get lost in the mass replies that ladies receive. Sometimes, I resend my replies a few days later asking if there is any interest, and I hear that they never saw my first reply.

So many people are scared. Many others are playing games. Add in the lies, deceptions, SPAM, and SCAMs, and it is so hard today to make a connection.....like trying to find a needle in a haystack.

If you are my needle I would love to find you. I want to find a lady that is looking for friendship, someone to do activities with, enjoys the outdoors, likes to cuddle, and would like a little romance when the time is right. Someone that can enjoy the moment, and doesn't have an agenda or is looking for someone to take care of them. Someone that is able to take it as it goes, has faith in us to build a friendship and/or a relationship, without self-imposed pressures.

Tell me a little about yourself so we can get started. Any age, race, religion, personal situation, etc. is welcome to reply. None of it matters to form a friendship, and we'll see where it goes from there. I don't need to see your pic because I care more about who you are rather than what you look like; however, if you want me to send you a pic, I expect you to send me yours first. Please put your favorite dessert in the subject line. If we meet someplace that has it on the menu, I'll buy you a serving of it. Thanks!

Please don't reply if you aren't real or serious, or want to exchange endless emails. I'm very serious about meeting to get to know you in person, and I want nothing to do with joining websites or paying for memberships.

Life is hard. You're probably too hard on yourself. You criticize yourself for not being a good enough wife, mother, career-woman, lover, etc..

I can related to this self-talk. Let's chat and listen to one another. Perhaps its the compassion we both need.

If you are an intelligent, professional, non-judgmental woman, I would love to chat. age, race, marital status not important.

Good evening! I see that I have piqued your interest. That's good as you see, this is the internet and you can look for anything here. With that in mind, and your attention, here is what I am looking for:

I am a MWM who is DDF, tall but HWP, average build and light features. I have a small fetish, though so far unexplored, about a slightly more mature woman. This is where you discreetly come in.

You are in your late 40's to 50's. You are attractive for your age, take care of yourself, and have a body that longs for a younger, forbidden man. You are also DDF and would like to start off with email exchanges to see if there is a mutual attraction. You can be single, married / divorced. Seduce me into being closer to you, wanting to see you, to talk to you, to meet you. Then, perhaps more.

Pictures and detail will move you to the front of my inbox. I can be as selective as I like since this is my fantasy, but knowing you, you are wanting to stand out from the crowd. I know you are out there, and I know you have had your eye on a man like me. Here is your chance, take it! Let's have some fun!

I'm looking for a new friend. I haven't really met any one since I've moved here and I'm getting tired of not having friends. Yes, I could go out and meet people but unfortunately, I don't really do the bar scene or club thing. So I don't have much of an opportunity to meet new people unless I decide to be creepy and walk up to people in a store. 

I'm looking for someone who is goofy and loves to laugh. I like to joke around a lot, so that is a must. I can be very sarcastic at times as well. I love movies, video games, fishing, cars, and then other things that tend to be more girly. 

I am not looking for a fling or anything like that. I am in a relationship and I'm not looking to change that at all.
