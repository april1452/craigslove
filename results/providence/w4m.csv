I am a 28 year old female with an attractive thin but curvy body. Caucasian and brunette. I'm very busy, but fun when I'm available.

My long term goal is a house in the woods with chickens. 

I am super open minded but picky, so be better than everyone else. I will not host.

I have two children and do not want more. Their father is pleasant and active and has them half of the time. I am a non-smoker. I work too much. 

I am seeking male age 27 to 37. Older than this and there seems to be a disconnect in our conversations. Plus, I have young parents and things get weird. I like men who can build things and fix things. I also enjoy men in fields of science and healthcare. I prefer those established in their careers rather than students, just because of our ages. I say ""men"" but I am open to women too because I like both. I only like feminine women. 

As I said, I am busy, so don't expect to meet up soon. But do start a conversation with me. Since I get so many replies, a simple hello with no explanation of who you are will get deleted. I prefer pictures and will usually share my own in return. Thanks!

I am a single mom who is looking for someone special. Someone who wants to know me in and out and support my dreams, as I will his. Someone who will be my soft place to land. Someone who is warm, understanding but strong at the same time. Someone who wants to be with me and wants to hold me. I want to make love and all of that is so much more powerful if it is with someone you love and who loves you. Looking for someone mature (not old) just not selfish and shallow.

Ok I am a bbw, brown hair, big brown eyes and short. I am a non-smoker (please be as well) and I don't drink. If you are a light drinker that's fine with me but NO drugs!! That's a deal breaker. I am looking for someone from about 34-47. I would love to have one more. I would love to give my son a sibling.

I like to go to the movies, talking on the phone, playing board games, swimming and going out to eat. I am warm, kind and understanding and very supportive. 
Please reply with some info about yourself, such as age, location, a general description of yourself and I have pics to share upon request. PLEASE do NOT respond if you have a problem with my ad or don't like bbw's or have something insulting to say!! I am too busy with a very small child and everything else I have to do to waste my time. Sorry if that sounds rude but that's just the way it is. 
Also please be a person who actually wants to meet, talk on the phone or do something. Again this may sound rude (sorry) but I am sick of guys who just want to text for days upon end and have no idea how to talk or to treat a lady. Please respond with a general description, your age and location (I don't want to get my hopes up for someone in California). A Pic would be great and anything else you would like to share. My schedule has opened up a bit in the mornings and sometimes evenings. Thank you very much. Hope to hear from some wonderful men soon.

People throw around terms like ""soul mate"" and ""love of my life"" to the point where it loses all meaning. I mean honestly, how many ""loves of your life"" do you get?
