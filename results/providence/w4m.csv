I am a 28 year old female with an attractive thin but curvy body. Caucasian and brunette. I'm very busy, but fun when I'm available.

My long term goal is a house in the woods with chickens. 

I am super open minded but picky, so be better than everyone else. I will not host.

I have two children and do not want more. Their father is pleasant and active and has them half of the time. I am a non-smoker. I work too much. 

I am seeking male age 27 to 37. Older than this and there seems to be a disconnect in our conversations. Plus, I have young parents and things get weird. I like men who can build things and fix things. I also enjoy men in fields of science and healthcare. I prefer those established in their careers rather than students, just because of our ages. I say ""men"" but I am open to women too because I like both. I only like feminine women. 

As I said, I am busy, so don't expect to meet up soon. But do start a conversation with me. Since I get so many replies, a simple hello with no explanation of who you are will get deleted. I prefer pictures and will usually share my own in return. Thanks!

Ok I am a bbw, brown hair, big brown eyes and short. I am a non-smoker (please be as well) and I don't drink. If you are a light drinker that's fine with me but NO drugs!! That's a deal breaker. I am looking for someone from about 34-47. I would love to have one more. I would love to give my son a sibling.

I like to go to the movies, talking on the phone, playing board games, swimming and going out to eat. I am warm, kind and understanding and very supportive. 
Please reply with some info about yourself, such as age, location, a general description of yourself and I have pics to share upon request. PLEASE do NOT respond if you have a problem with my ad or don't like bbw's or have something insulting to say!! I am too busy with a very small child and everything else I have to do to waste my time. Sorry if that sounds rude but that's just the way it is. 
Also please be a person who actually wants to meet, talk on the phone or do something. Again this may sound rude (sorry) but I am sick of guys who just want to text for days upon end and have no idea how to talk or to treat a lady. Please respond with a general description, your age and location (I don't want to get my hopes up for someone in California). A Pic would be great and anything else you would like to share. My schedule has opened up a bit in the mornings and sometimes evenings. Thank you very much. Hope to hear from some wonderful men soon.

Hello! Divorced mom, age 48, average looking, tall, has grown kids, looking to meet an unattached man between the ages of 40 and 55. Must live locally in RI / SE MA area.

Specifically seeking a non smoker or reformed smoker (420 ok) social or non-drinker, non drug user, disease free. Please have your own home and car. Good sense of humor a must! 

Not into the weird fetish stuff I see here on CL, and not looking for FWB or to accommodate some married guy looking to cheat on his wife.

I'm asymptomatic but do have HSV. It really doesn't affect my life at all except for trying to find a partner. Men are not lining up at the door to date a woman with HSV, that being said my standards are not low. I'm not shallow & I seek a genuine connection, friends leading to more but there obviously has to be mutual attraction & chemistry.

I just turned 45 & prefer to date men in my age range (40-50). I'm very unique, self sufficient, intelligent, compassionate, love nature & animals, into organic/clean eating, down to earth...lots more just ask. 

Physically I'm white, on the short side, curvy (not fat but trying to get more fit), average looks with green eyes.

I don't care what nationality/race you are. I prefer a unique, down to earth man with similar interests. I also don't care if you are HSV+ or not, safe sex is a must either way.

I never cheated on anyone and will always treat you with a lot of love and respect. I am far from thin so if you like thin chicks I am not for you. I am however quite voluptuous.

I like to go to the movies, talking on the phone, playing board games, swimming and going out to eat. I am warm, kind and understanding and very supportive. 
Please reply with some info about yourself, such as age, location, a general description of yourself and I have pics to share upon request. PLEASE do NOT respond if you have a problem with my ad or don't like bbw's or have something insulting to say!! I am too busy with a very small child and everything else I have to do to waste my time. Sorry if that sounds rude but that's just the way it is. 
Also please be a person who actually wants to meet, talk on the phone or do something. Again this may sound rude (sorry) but I am sick of guys who just want to text for days upon end and have no idea how to talk or to treat a lady. Please respond with a general description, your age and location (I don't want to get my hopes up for someone in California). A Pic would be great and anything else you would like to share. My schedule has opened up a bit in the mornings and sometimes evenings. Thank you very much. Hope to hear from some wonderful men soon.

HEAVYSET WOMAN LOOKING FOR A SNUGLY AND READY TO ENJOY LIFE MAN

Hi guys, Let me start by saying, I had posted here before and received A LOT of emails. None of the men worked out. They either lived on the West coast or there was not enough spark/interest when we finally spoke. So I am here trying this AGAIN!
I am a 50 year old heavyset woman. I have brown hair and brown eyes. I am looking for my drama free other half, my partner in life through good times and even bad times. 
I love the outdoors- long walks, picnics, watching sunsets, leisure bike rides, camping, hiking. I love movies (either at the theater or staying home.)
I'm honest, caring, genuine, and loving and sincere. I can be shy in new situations, but I am also very outgoing when I am comfortable with my surroundings. I like thinking outside the box. I love to be happy and optimistic in life. 
I love to laugh, smile, and talk. I love children and most animals. I do not smoke and I drink socially. I like to eat out at local restaurants and finding new, out of the way places to eat. I like to be comfortable in anything I wear. I am not a girlie girl!!! I like to dress up, but I am always comfortable in what ever I wear. Your looks are not important, your personality is everything!! 
I'M NOT LOOKING TO MEET, TEXT OR TALK ON THE PHONE TODAY!!!
I am looking to get to know people through here/email and then see if we have enough in common to meet! If you do not have time to invest in getting to know each other first, then please do not email me. When you email me, please enclose a recent picture of yourself. I will then respond with a picture of myself.

I enjoy shooting pool going to the beach cuddling watching movies and just spending time together. 
I do not smoke do drugs or drink and I am looking for the same.
I am looking for someone that is honest and romantic. Someone that isnt into the games either. 
Someone that is good with children as I stated I am a mom I do have kids. 
If anyone is interested in knowing more please feel free to email me. I did have an ad posted last night but for some odd reason it was flagged and I have no idea why.

Lol... But yea im not very picky as far as looks and im far from a gold digger..so dont feel like you have to have the best job or be johnny depp just to have a chance...as long as you can keep it honest and respectful we should at the very least become good friends...soo yea if your looking for a night out and you meet the few requirements that i have then feel free to reply.. If your 420 friendly then that is a huge plus and you will make the top of my list...and when i say friendly i mean u actually participate and not just ok being around it...just want to be clear about that.

Hi I am here to find myself a boyfriend but not just anybody. I would like someone to run away with and start a new life and new identity. I'm not in trouble and there is no physical abuse going on but I definitely feel mental abuse a lot during the day. Mostly from my family and then the rest from myself. I am 18 now and I am quite mature for my age. I'm ready to take off and find a life long companion. Someone will love me and will want to keep me forever and make sure that no one else can have me. I've always pictured myself at home cooking and cleaning that sounds like fun to me. I want someone who will not only treat me like a girlfriend bur I also wanted to be treated as if I am a princess and that I am the light of hour life. And don't worry I'm a very modest person and I don't like to judge others. I have had a lot of friends and I have known a lot of people will all sorts of problems: anxiety, anger management issues, depression, low self esteem. It's OK if you have any of these I will always be here to help you and I won't leave you no matter what. The only preference I have is that I only like white guys and someone who is OK with me being overweight. I will never send my picture first just because I don't like getting scammed so if we email for a bit and hit it off then I do expect you to b send a picture and then I'd love to talk over the phone to make sure you're actually a person.

I know when we first meet someone all we have is the physical to go by as far as an attraction goes but that is the start I suppose. I know you should never judge a person solely on what they look like because their is always more than the outside of a person but meeting someone this way online that is all you have. We cant help who we are attracted to and who we are not attracted to. I am hoping I can find someone that is good for me and me for them.

Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to read my post :)

I know this is CL and I may have unrealistic expectations that I might find what I am looking for, but sometimes you just have to take chances in life as you never know what can happen, and I choose to be optimistic. Before you continue reading, please note that I am NOT looking for a FWB type situation. I do NOT want to be someones affair, extra lover, submissive or anything like that. I am looking for something real. Someone I can get to know and hopefully share a life with someday. If you are still with me and are interested in the same thing, please continue reading 


One thing you should know about me is that I value my family and friends more than anything else in life. Without them, life would be a very sad existence. I would hope that you feel the same about yours.

A little about me, I am a single white female, in my early 50's and I do my best to enjoy life and be happy about something everyday. That does not mean I do not have a bad day now and then, but who doesn't right? I am fairly easy going most of the time. I am passionate about things that are important to me and I have a big heart, which has not always worked out so well for me, but I keep pressing on. Life is to short to stay stuck in a rut. I am loving, kind, caring, open minded, compassionate, affectionate and cuddly...just to name a few. One more thing, I have been told I am cute, pretty and beautiful, but I do not come in a tiny little package. I would NOT consider myself to be a BBW, but I do have some meat on my bones. I am an active, confident woman and I am happy with who I am. I know a lot of people are stuck on body type, which is fine because we are attracted to what we are attracted to, so kindly exit my post now if soft and squishy is not your thing.

I enjoy so many things, but here is a short list to get started:
-Getting together with friends and family
-Cooking
-Dancing
-Travel (I love to explore new places local or otherwise)
-Camping
-Anything to do with the ocean or beach (it is a very happy place for me)

This section is for LTR's which means ""Long Term Relationships/Dating"" Not strictly platonic, not misc romance, and not Casual Encounters. So that being said.....

I'm 46, love to laugh, make others laugh, feel safe and comfortable around my friends. Would love to find someone who would like to get together and make each other's lives better. Cooking together, relaxing around the fire pit, I don't drink, but it's ok if you do in moderation. It would be nice to plan weekends to do fun things like go to yard sales, flea markets, auctions. 

Never married but I do have one child who is almost 18. At this point in our lives, we ALL have baggage, don't fool yourself and don't think you will find someone without it. It's called ""Life"". Some of us got it right the first time, and then there are us, land of the misfits, here on Craig's List Personals. It's just how it goes sometimes. 

Not much of a t.v. person. Would prefer to either communicate with friends and family on the internet, or find a relaxing place to read a book. 

Have one dog, and one cat. Live simply. Not high maintenance. Hate clutter and the feeling of instability. Lived in my house now for 15 years ( I rent) Love muscle cars, trucks, evenings at the beach. If you know your way around an engine, that's a plus! 

Looking for a blue collar man. Someone who does enough during the week that he doesn't need to brag about the gym. 

I'm a homebody. I don't drink, but do smoke. Would like to find someone who could just blend into my life. 

No one is perfect either....so take a chance, expose your faults and let me see if I can appreciate them for all that they are!

Sorry that the pictures here aren't of me. I'd like to first talk and see if we have the same interests first. Looking for my age range 45-49 Thanks! And good luck to everyone out there.

Me; mature artistic, passionate about life, the Arts and about finding a good man:), selective, educated, original, love Nature, poetry and history, esp of the UK. I also love music, esp classical and classic rock and folk music from everywhere. Like to get out & do light hiking, tennis even.

Not young anymore, but all woman, and a good woman too.
Im a giver and I seek a giver.

I also seek my opposite in a sense, I prefer very clean-cut, (no facial hair/chronic cap-wearing) professional man who takes care of himself and likes a bit of earthy and passionate and Artsy in a woman. Opposites can attract, with meeting of hearts and minds~and of course, that thing called Chemistry. 

Pls send pic, and tell me about yourself...will return the favour with a pic of me....

Pls, no one-liners w/o pic, wont reply to those, as ive gone out on a limb here to tell you about me, you surely can do the same. Will reciprocate w/ pic. Mature woman now, but interesting & unique & feminine, blond w/ golden brown eyes, and you can take me almost anywhere:)

I'm shy but sassy and curvy, full-figured woman and a hopeless romantic. I have softest skin and hair which is highlighted blonde/brown/red, the most piercing bright blue eyes, and in my early 40s (I look younger). I'm hopefully seeking a nice and kind and hopefully handy, tall, attractive man that I can easily talk to since I talk a lot. Then, I'd love to spend some mutual time together or even take me for a weekend escape. I'm a white, healthcare professional with my own condo and every single cooking appliance that a kitchen needs but I don't use. I'm someone who loves my stressful job and actually enjoys going to work everyday. I also love random trips to the beach, Foxwoods, my time share in NH, and Florida to see my adult son .. food wise - I'm simple .. I like burgers, ice cream from Gibbys or Swirls and Scoops, Fettucine Alfredo are my favorites. My favorite drink is a frozen mudslide. Furthermore, I enjoy redecorating my living space, matching my outfits, and making spreadsheets. If you can relate that maybe we could go out for a drink and go from there. Looking for something that will possibly lead to a LTR. If you want to know more, just ask. Thank you for reading!

I'm looking for you if you'll have me. I'm cute, (adorable actually), I'm 53 and honest about myself, my body, my looks, my weight, my personality. I'd like to meet someone who wants to be active and go places. I'm not looking for perverts so don't waste my time. Looking for ltr, or just hanging out. I'm NOT looking for hookups with any freaks. I'm single and you must be also. I'm funny, very pretty, and I'm worth it. You should be too. (not the pretty part).

Why is it so hard to find and honest, caring, non game player? It seems everyone wants sex on the first day or just wants to hang out at my house! Where have all the gentlemen gone? Doesn't anyone want to get to know someone before jumping into bed? Where has all the romance gone? 
I am far from perfect and don't expect the same. Im a caring loving women who takes care of herself. I don't need a leech who wants to park on my couch and do nothing. Im more then willing to give as I receive and love to cook and pamper my other half but it all takes time. I want an old time romance and love affair where the two people take their time and build something. 
I would love to find a man who is secure in himself and who is looking for a good women. I love to laugh and enjoy life and what it has to offer. Im not a stick of a women but I can touch my toes!! Im happy in myself and love to exercise and eat well during the week. The weekend are for living and enjoying. Good wine and good food are gods gifts. 
Please if you are married, or not looking for a serious relationship in time then don't write me. 
Live, Laugh, Love..............Peace

Ok, so I hope my funny headline got your attention. It's funny yes, but 100% accurate. I am looking for someone who might be a little shy. He might even feel he is socially awkward. These are things I think about myself most of the time.



About me: I am 40 years old. please be between 35-45 (approx) I am overweight....but I have a good personality. I am a genuinely nice person. My only problem is I can (sometimes) be shy....really depends on the situation. I am very non-judgmental.



I really just want someone to talk to. Share my days with. Someone who might like to go out occasionally....but doesn't mind staying in and watching tv, or play a game. I don't have a ton of free time.....but I am so sick of spending it alone.



Even if you're just looking for a friend, and no kind of relationship...please write.



Absolutely no sex talk....not even if I like you. You will be deleted immediately....even if we've been talking for a while. YES I mean it.....NO I will not make exceptions for YOU.

Thank you to everyone who responded to my ad about ""Can you tell me what is wrong with all of us""

For those of you who wrote back with sincerity, I genuinely appreciated it. It was nice to hear from intelligent men who offered some reassurance that I wasn't alone in my thought process. 

Oh, I did get the rude messages, which I expected to receive. 

Some said that I was alone because of the choices I made in life. That made me laugh, because ""the choices"" I made is what makes me ""me"". I don't regret my choices. 

I think I just posted here, looking for some answers, to know what men think about being single at this age. I got the typical responses/messages that I knew I would get....dick pics, phone numbers, propositions. For those of you who did do that, well....there would be your answer as to why you are still single. 

Some men wrote hateful things about being single, child reaching adult age and so apparently I am looking for someone to compensate my welfare. LOL Seems to me that those who said things like that, are more than likely deadbeat dads who know the ""system"" or something. And for the person who assumed that, you are wrong. You see, I invested my life raising my child, instilling morals and values in him, so that he makes a difference in this world. Be it my only contribution to society, I know I have done a very good job. He's not a little jerk who lets his pants sag, is disrespectful and thinks life owes him things.......... I didn't rely on the ""system"" to raise my child. And I have what I call ""the man hands"" to prove how hard I've worked. I've never had nice nails...but that's not what makes me, ""me"". I'd rather have real than fake.

Funny quote I read: 

""No matter how good they look, or how nice they act, someone, somewhere, is tired of their shit""

Good luck to everyone out there. As for me, I will stay single.
