Hello. I'm a 23 year old female who's interested in starting slowly. I would like to go get a drink or get local coffee and hold a great conversation. I'm in the process of getting my master's, have my own place, and car. I'm intrigued by intelligence and wittiness. I'm pretty big, but I'm very active and in the process of losing weight. I like to sing, go dance, or just stay home and cook. I'm not necessarily looking for romance, so if the appearance does not matter and you're willing to start a friendship that may develop into something, shoot me an email and tell me about yourself. Picture is greatly welcomed

Perhaps a coffee session at a nice local providence downtown bakery, or a brunch?

*please be no more than 30 years old
*please no kids
*please write something about yourself when you send an email not just ""hey babe""

Been a shitty week & we've all got needs. Someone gentle. Kind. Let's share a few drinks & some quiet conversation. Make me laugh. Soft passion. Intimacy without the unnecessary drama. Affection. A night between two adults. Let's be whatever we want for the night, without strings. Be over 6ft, 30-40 & a single white male, & be good with a short, single white plus sized plain jane. Face photo & stats in first email please, that's what I'm basing my decision on. My pic in return. I host, near North Smithfield.

Hello, I am am 34 years old from the Southern IL/ Western Ky area. Fist let me start by saying that I am a BBW in transition. I am currently a size 16 but I am losing weight due to having the gastric bypass surgery. I'm at this weird place in my life where I feel like im too small for some and still too big for others. I have long dark auburn hair (but I do change it up sometimes) Grey/blue eyes (that sometimes look green) and I am 5ft6.

I am completely single. I have no children, and have never been married. What I want more than anything is to change all of that! I would love to find a SWM in the age range of 28-40(ish), located LOCALLY (within 30-40 minutes) from me. I am seeking a LTR ONLY, possibly leading to marriage some day (No, I'm not interested in ""hooking up"" with you). 

I love a good sense of humor and witty intelligence above all else. Honesty, integrity and compassion are all equally important. Good personal hygiene is a must! (Sad that I have to explicitly state that). You don't have to go to church, but a belief in God is important. No alcohol or drug dependencies!
I come from a good country family. I was born and raised country and I love it! While I like doing things such as ATV riding, bonfires and muddin, I also enjoy things like going to a concert, comedy shows, Broadway shows etc. I don't really listen to country music (I'm more of a classic rock girl) but I'm not going to tease you if you do. My family are avid hunters and fishermen, so if you're one of those people who are in favor of taking everyone's guns- keep walking!

Physically, I a normally find myself attracted to dark hair and eyes, tall men, (well maintained) beards are good. I do like tattoos as long as they are below the neck. HOWEVER, I want to love your soul not your face! The only real request I have is someone who is average to a little extra weight built. Since I am trying so hard to change my lifestyle and eating habits I need someone who can support me with that and not drag me down with theirs. 

I know this is a lot to read so if you have made it through pat yourself on the back! Like I said in my title maybe I'm looking for the impossible, but you never know what you'll find unless you put yourself out there. If I sound interesting to you, message me! I will gladly exchange pic for pic after you send me one *smiles*. Please do NOT send me nude pictures or ask for any from me. To prove to me that you have actually taken the time to read this, type ""I read it!"" in the title of your response please. This is my second attempt here and 99% of the emails started with ""So what are you looking for?"" I really hope you're out there, and you're looking for me too

Maybe so, and maybe not! Thought I would give this a shot! 
I have been here before, without any real connection! 
But hey, I'm not a quitter when it comes to LOVE! 
I will always seek it out! 
I am in a place in my life where I have free time for someone special to me! 
I am a very loving, honest, likable person. I live drama free! And you should to! 
I want a man that knows who he is, confident, humorous, smart, strong morals.
Comfortable in his own skin! Normal. The boy next door! 
Want something more than a one-night stand! Not into that! I have so much to give to the right person. 
Wants to be with a easy going woman who loves to love. 
I like the great outdoors and inside to! 
Like to cook with my man, and do fun things! We will decide together what that is! 
You have to live in my town, and have a picture! The eyes are the windows to the soul! 
I won't respond otherwise. 
I will leave it as it is written, for now!

I'm looking for something between a new friend / +1 and my future ex-husband. Are you the man?!

SWF, 44, educated, accomplished, and traveled, 5' 1"", brown eyed, brunette cutie with no children. An artist doing what I love, very little separates work from play. I'd love to meet a charming fellow outside my circle of friends and colleagues to join me for concerts, films, lectures, exhibitions, and adventures like the hunt for the perfect Manhattan, donut or the best corned beef hash. There can be no appreciation of the sublime without an affinity for the absurd.

I make my own schedule and no two days are the same for me. I'm best suited for a chivalrous, ridiculously smart, genuinely witty, single man, around 35-50-ish, without children, probably self-employed, an entrepreneur, or a free lancer. It's a mindset and lifestyle that we both embrace even the risk / reward trade-offs. Like me, you have your own place. I have room in my life for a relationship though I have no set expectation or predetermined outcome in mind here. How's that sound?

That doesn't mean I am not human and don't deserve love and respect. I am hoping to find my partner for the rest of my life and this is just one avenue. I am also on okcupid and eharmony.

I'll make it simple: single wf looking for single (not married, separated, or otherwise partnered) wm. Please be over 5'9"", between the ages of 50 and 60,a non smoker, have grown or no kids, and have some interests in common. Some of the things I enjoy are sports, antiquing, being 'out', good food and wine, great conversations, road trips to nowhere, the beach, reading, etc. 
Let's start talking and see where it takes us! Tell me a bit about yourself - more than 'hi' or 'here's my number'! And avoid photos of your 'assets'......they are not a good introduction! 
To avoid the inevitable spam please include one of the teams playing in the 'big game' on 2/7!

I am a twenty-two year old nearly-college grad looking for a special someone to share a romantic valentine's day dinner with me. 

I am 5'5"", brunette, blue-eyed, love bad (good) puns, must love dogs & Fleetwood Mac. Honestly, I'm just a cool girl looking for some good food, great wine and even better conversation.

Write to me with a pic of yourself and your idea of a perfect Valentine's Day date. 

Hope to hear from you,

Great woman looking for a great guy. I'm down to earth, open minded, understanding, love to have fun and laugh. I have a great personality. I'm intelligent and can hold a conversation. I'm not looking for a one night stand just hoping to find someone I connect with and then can grow with. I am divorced with 2 kids so I am not looking for anymore. honest fun men over 38 and under 50 need apply and let's see if we connect. Thanks for reading and take care.

Hi there, so I'm looking for a relationship (so please be around my age and single)! 

I live in Mass but close enough that I enjoy adventuring around providence on the weekends. I would love to explore the Natural History Museum, go for a walk, maybe bookend the night with a Pawtucket Bruins game and a beer (or two) or maybe just awesome conversation at the Scurvy Dog?


If you're interested and looking to date a super rad BBW - then send a photo and a bit about how awesome you are!

Bonus points will be awarded to those who have tattoos / piercings.

Is there anyone out there looking for a long term relationship based on friendship first? Looking to date, have fun, establish a friendship and see where it goes. 

Not looking for FWB or a one night stand so if you're looking for that, please move on. 

Please respond with a picture so I know you are real and let me know what you like to do for fun. 

Hope to hear from you. TGIF

Dark-skin, full-body black woman...5'9...kind of/somewhat attractive...doesn't look too shabby in a dress or a man's shirt, light fragrance and a smile...long legs come in handy sometimes...funny, awkward, considerate and kind hearted.

Bonafied man, stands/tops over 5'9 inches of me, seasoned 40-50, steady not too intense, non smoker who leaves a lasting impression. X marks the spot. Uses/selects his words wisely and timely.

Who would like to exchange nouns, verbs and under rated adjectives...stroll through a small town that has character, chase the sun's rays, and who would indulge in breakfast at dinnertime. I appreciate an eclectic/semi nerdy vocab. Affinity for laugh lines, dimples, flecks of gray, a man's blazer, strong hands. Someone who's built as much/more for comfort than speed.

Once mutual interest/curiosity is expressed, your primary form of communication isn't via text. 

Clear visible no shades photo with dim/highlights about yourself gets a response as I do have a recent photo to exchange.

Weed out spam, etc...Put your AGE as the subject in your response.

Thanks
Lynn

Happy New Year, I wish for happiness and prosperity for all of us.

Little about myself, I'm very young at heart and young looking American Korean, who speaks English and Korean fluently. I aim to live an active life and try to live in the moment and make it meaningful. I try to learn something new everyday and do my best to think outside the box. I'm a bit of a foodie, love trying new things, checking out new places, love to cook as well, and currently looking for a dishwasher :-). I do enjoy feeding others and catching up with friends and family over food.
I'm looking for a male version of me, who is young at heart and open minded Asian male 41 - 51, ""my better half"". I'm hoping you're a happy go lucky kinda guy and just need a good partner to share the journey with. I don't have much of an expectation on CL, but you never know and it only takes one right person. I'm here and I believe my better half is out there, so my search continues. Hopefully you're happy with your job, have a good relationship with family and friends, and live an active life. I have a lot of different hobbies and hopefully we have something in common. Please be a nonsmoker, a social drinker, and someone who lives a balanced life.

Tell me a little about yourself, send pictures, a list of hobbies and pet peeves.

Kudo points if you own your own kayak, motorcycle, if you're a pilot or if you own a restaurant or if you're a chef that's looking to open a restaurant in the future.

I ride a Triumph Daytona 675r and have an orange kayak.
I play tennis and volleyball, but like playing a lot of different sports.
I am open to any activities.

Let's see where it takes us.
