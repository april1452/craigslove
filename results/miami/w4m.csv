I'm no queen,hence need no king(nor a slave).I'm not feminist,and you shouldn't be a misogynist.

Was born and raised in a political dynasty with strict family eduction,but definitely a mutineer.I grew up with a strong sense of justice and compassion.No tattoo,don't smoke,socially drink.Rational,precise,very good at numbers.Spontanenous but rarely go emotional.Read a lot,but not a book worm.Fond of all schools of art particularly that of the 18th and 19th centuries.

Clean,tidy,caring,fashionable,adventurous,post-modern spirit,active and innovative,well-organized,home-oriented,hard-working,excellent cook.Not a perfectionist,just being a real self.Animal lover although i'm allergic to all furry creatures(In addition to hairy men).Amateur F1 car racer,golf player.

Objectively speaking,i'm pretty good looking.Thin,but not skinny.5'8'' tall,51kg,healthy,single,no kids,achieved a model qualification after University graduation,and been an airline stewardess for a while.

I'm a forseer.Ambitious,self-driven independent business woman,looking for a mature,stable,honest guy with consistency and single-minded in love for long term relationship which could lead to marriage.You need to have a regular job,and financially secure.My ideal man should be good looking,smart,healthy both physically and mentally.Age:24-46.Single or divorced without kids.Disease/drama/EX gfs/wives FREE.Feel free to ask anything further,i will answer with complete honesty.

Please note that i'm here looking for a future husband only,not a sugar boy or dating partner.

I don't need slick praise or candlelight hymn,but a man who can fix a sofa leg when it's broken,or can cook for himself when i'm away.

Generally,a man who can solve problems and build a future together with me,not a romanticist or a theoretician.

I would rather spend most of the time with you on talking about economy and politics than clothes and perfume.

When i see problems occur,i go to solve them.Meaningless nonsense and complain doesn't make sense to me.

Patient but can't tolerate nagging people(Sticky is fine).

I'm a 3 heads and 6 legs competent woman and won't accept a man who can't match/challenge me both mentally and intellectually.

Scammers and snobbish/materialistic dudes should knock off.And if you never have the time to care about other people's feelings and needs,my suggestion is you should marry yourself.

If you're a typical selfish/egoistic/self-centered ignorant person,or looking for someone to take care of you financially/invest you personally you're just becoming a day dreamer.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

PS:I require a Skype video chat after several emails/photos exchanging,when it's time to check whether the one writing to me is true(vice versa for you).And if you fail to show up on cam,i'll stop replying and delete you.Too busy for perpetual text messages or email texting and all kinds of time wasters.

Please write your first e-mail in the self-introduction form.NO PICTURE NO REPLY.

Last but not least,VIRGO men are out of consideration.DON'T bother,save all the nice words for yourself.No preaching,no brainwash,don't scheme,you will never GAIN anything from me,go use others.

So here is some information about me. I could rattle off a lot of really great things about me, but I'm going to also toss in some bad. Because I'm looking for someone who will be genuinely interested in me and getting to know me. By no means am I just looking for some fling or to play or be played. 

I'm 30 years old. I'm tall, a little overweight, but I wear it well. I'm heavily tattooed and I have brown hair & brown eyes. I have a few piercings. I'm a mother to an awesome little boy. His father isn't in the picture, and doesn't appear to have plans to be around either. I'm a college student. I love to read, its my favorite thing to do. I'm also a Netflix junkie & I have been known to binge watch several seasons of a TV show if I become obsessed. I like to go out occasionally, but I am a home body. I also am extremely blunt and incredibly sarcastic, but I don't purposely try to hurt other peoples feelings. I have a huge heart & I care about everything, but I don't consider it a fault. I'm from Chicago & I've been here in Fort Lauderdale just over 1 year now. 

I'm looking for someone to date, be romantic with, possibly fall in love with, all that good stuff. I want to get married eventually. I don't want more kids. & at the very least, I would love to have some new friends.

I also have a job, I'm doing well for myself, I'm in school...but I still have a void that needs to be filled by a loving man. I want a man that has patience, is respectful, kind, thoughtful that wants to love and be loved. I consider myself a fair good looking young woman.

Also, a little about me and my interests. I enjoy dancing, live music, cooking, traveling and shopping at times. I'm a fan of warm weather and beaches. Sucker for Mexican beer and love a nice glass of wine. I have been known to go outdoors and ride four-wheelers with the guys. And I'm not afraid of getting dirty. However, keeping my hair and nails done is more important. Lol..I enjoy laughing and smiling. I have a witty and sarcastic personality and always cut up.

I'm looking to chat a bit and when I am home from work, maybe have dinner and hang out. For the right person....I'd settle down again.

I'm trying this again...ever hopeful am I that I'll find a Valentine and more...

Zany, adventurous, busy, funny woman seeks boyfriend. I'm pretty on bad days, but I clean up way better than that. I'm a mad yogini with an active practice and a barre lover. I box. I spin. I tried paddleboarding and didn't drown. I ran my first 5K in early October and the paramedics did not have to resuscitate me. Win! I fear my Olympic dreams now hinge upon Curling, because sliding a rock and sweeping ice don't seem to be contingent on age or fitness level. Hiking and camping can be fun but so are shopping and luxury travel. I love spa days. I cook. I read fiction. I laugh at politics. I have a job and a house and a car. I have a child and some pets. I travel for work and fun. I've been a season ticket holder for Philly sports for 22 years, but I never go to the games. I like movies and concerts. I try new things. I laugh a lot at a lot of things. I've recently decided that I might be willing to trade sexual favors for snow removal in the event of another storm.

I'm looking for someone laid back who's been beaten up by life and relationships and is still able to laugh. Of course you have baggage, and you can describe it and explain how you carry it. You're single, divorced or widowed and have been for a good while. Bonus points to men who are good dads and love kids! I am so, so, so not a rebound person. I'm not interested in anyone recently separated. You need time. I've had too much of it. You are not seeing a therapist. Three's a crowd! Also, you are NOT a therapist yourself. 

You have an education and a job and car and some interests of your own. You like animals and kids and doing stuff. Stuff should include binge-watching Netflix weekends and going out to do fun things. If you are someone who constantly needs to be doing something and hates staying put, I'm not for you. Alternately, if you're someone who doesn't want to do anything, ever, I'm not for you, either. You are able to explain the status of your preparedness for the impending zombie apocalypse as well as where you'd go if you could beam anywhere. You have a sense of humor.

You're passionate about some stuff, but you are not a zealot about anything. You listen more than you speak. You remember the good ol' days when having an opinion did not necessarily mean it was worth sharing, much less sharing as the penultimate truth to the exclusion of hearing others. You do not quote Fox News. Donald Trump is not your guy. You have a sense of social justice.

You do not have anger management issues. Your boss/ex has not suggested that you try AA. Or NA. Or AnyOtherA. You're not taking meds for psychosis or schizophrenia. You are not looking to reenact 50 Shades of Stupidity because it looked fun on the screen. You went to college. You don't say ""I'm looking for my soulmate but you wrote too much"" when you email. I've met those guys. We didn't get on so well. Literacy is super-sexy.

You are really reluctant to answer because this is CL. You are not a serial dater (or a serial killer, or really any kind of serial anything). If you are a perennial CL first responder, I'm probably not your girl.

If you smoke, you don't do it around me. Whatever recreational drugs you tried in your misspent youth are now great stories, and we won't have to stop on a street corner in Darby to pick more up if we ever go out. You have not been in a prison as a long-term guest of the county, state or federal government.

Friends first. If you're a nice person and overall good guy in your 40s or 50s, send me an email and then maybe we can text some and then talk and meet. I'm not in a hurry but I would like to actually meet in person at a point and see where things go in real life.

So ive come to my tried and true CL to find something extremely specific

I am a MBF looking to relocate to the miami area, that being said i have a 7 month old son, which as you can imagine makes working, let alone, moving a difficult task.

As for the married part, my husband sucks and i need to get away from him. Me and a friend will be visiting in February and my hope is to meet with a few guys (choices are lovely) and see what clicks.

A bit more about me:
Graduated from a decent university with a BA in Religion, Jersey native. 5'5 about 145lbs. I'm very open to different scenarios and dont necessarily have a ""type"". I love to cook and clean, no seriously. I am NOT looking to be anything close to a slave, im not desperate just in search of a better life for me and the babe. No ""drugs"" and certainly no disease. I can be your best match or your worst nightmare, it really depends majorly on how im treated. I would prefer to be a stay at home mother for as long as possible, or atleast until our boy turns 1. I enjoy the beach (for tanning mostly) and swimming, ofcourse the occasional puff puff pass is always appreciated.

Somethings im looking for:
A caring, gentle and extremely patient man that will hold my hand and hug me tightly. This man should LOVE kids (if things go well id like to have more) Please live alone!!! A car would be helpful, but i do have my own that i would consider to take down with me. I prefer a taller man, but im certainly not picky. Whatever race, whatever religion as long as youre open as well. No slackers or druggies, no old dirty men trying to lock me away in the basement.

Im throwing up a prayer and hoping this message reaches the right guy in time. Even if your arent sure about a longterm romantic relationship, perhaps we could just begin as good friends. Really just need a good, nice, hardworking individual thats willing to lend a helping hand. 

PLEASE note i will NOT send pictures until some real conversation is established, im serious about this and i hope you will be too.

I am just looking for a friend hoping for more but no pressure. I like movies, dinner, casino, and just hanging out whether going for a drive to orlando or just staying in and watch a movie and cuddle. I am boring all I do is go to work and stay home. Thats because I have no one to do things with. ""Popcorn for one please"" sound really sad to me. So if you looking for a friend to go eat with and play the slots with or just watch the latest movie with get at me. Im not offering sex but I still have the Sun number if you want to fuck something hot. 
If you are a cool guy down to earth and laidback looking for a friend and have same interest as me please reply changing the subject Sun so I know you read the ad and we go from there.

Hello,

I'm hoping to meet a guy on Craigslist that is 40-60 and fun to be with. I want to start off casual...perhaps get together for drinks, etc. first and see if we like each other. Other items to note, must be able to carry on a conversation. I would like to see how I'm speaking with so please send a pic with your email response. Responses without pictures will not be answered.

I am a short red-head, height-weight proportionate and lots of fun! :) When we meet I'll explain more of what I'm looking for.....which is more than I wish to put in an ad. Intrigued?

So respond and find out!

Hi, I'm not on here to play games. So, if that's what your about please move on to another ad. I actually want to meet someone, who's ready for I have to offer.

I am a positive thinker and somewhat a spiritual person. Both of these are what makes me different from most females. I like cooking, doing laundry, shopping (whether its for both clothes and food), sometimes cleaning and relaxing. I'm not the type of person who likes arguments but I like having healthy progressive conversations. I'm a down to earth person who ain't afraid of speaking my mind or admit when I am wrong. 

I like positive and ambitious persons.

What I look for in a guy.

Someone who is open, responsible, honest, kind, reliable, helpful, tall( 5' 10 or taller) and ambitious. Someone who knows that it takes two for any relationship to work successfully. 

If you think you can manage my needs and want to know more about me, you can email me and tell your thoughts on how a relationship should be and also you're needs from a potential companion.

Hoping to meet someone who is wanting a long term relationship with the possibility of marriage in the future. We need to make sure we have some things in common. I'm actually always open to meet people who have different interests than I do because it's always a great way to learn about/experience something new. Here's some info about me:

- I work a full-time at a professional job.
- The worst job I ever had was cleaning airplane food trays!
- My friends and family would consider my best attribute to be my sincerity.
- I had my first crush at age five on my cousin's cousin.
- My favorite subject in school growing up was journalism!
- If I had one wish for the world it would be: that we could all live and let live!
- My favorite movie is The Shawshank Redemption.
-I have brown hair, blue eyes, am 5'2"" and considered a BBW

I am looking for someone:

-Professional
-Personable
-Who will go to the movies and out to dinner with me!
-Who knows how to take care of himself (financially, mentally, and emotionally). I do it, so should you.
-Can enjoy the simple things in life and has an optimistic outlook.
-Knows how to be kind to people and appreciate what he has.
-Who has a sense of humor and can hold a conversation about anything!

In my free time I enjoy binge watching Netflix, crocheting, taking photos, and long walks along the river front. I love going to movies, listening to music, playing a board or card game and just hanging out with friends or family. There's not much I enjoy more than a good conversation and laugh with with someone special.

My ideal date would be something fun! Dinner, maybe a movie, a drive around town sight seeing and sharing our favorite spots is always a good way to get to know someone.

I'm looking to start a romance. Hopefully long term, maybe for the rest of our lives. Please be between the ages of 40 and 55 and willing to take the time needed to get to know someone.

Please reply with more than just a, ""hello."" My reply of, ""hey"" isn't going to get us very far. Tell me something that will make me want to reply to you first before anyone else! Put your favorite movie in the subject line so your message doesn't get sent directly to the SPAM folder!

1st let me say I'm a totally cool chic, college educated, have had some absolute amazing positions in my career that most only dream about. I've learned that a career isn't what makes a person special no matter what others tell you. 
I'm actually more humble and kind than I am arrogant and uncaring of others thoughts and feelings.

So here comes the difficult part and never in a million years did I ever think I'd be in a situation where I would be seeking something a bit unorthodox. 
Bare with me while I gather my thoughts and try to cautiously govern what I'm about to say...............
I'd like to meet an attractive man between the age of 29-37
You must be a Non Smoker
Have a solid job or career
Own your own vehicle
Be completely straight 
Fully believe in God (Christian) not atheist, agnostic or anything else that I might of forgotten to list, oh did I say and not into anything Satanic? Yikes
You Must be healthy and range from fit to average 
If you are Military affiliated that works for me since my background is Military. Military just seems to mesh better with other Military types.

If you like dogs that's cool since I'm thinking about getting one. 
I have a cool pad, my own vehicle and my own income. 
I'm average looking and I'm considered attractive average. I believe confidence and high self esteem go a long way and make a difference. 
I don't drink, do drugs and I'm 100% positive I am disease free so you be too.

I'm a chic that can clock anyone, female or male if need be. However brawls are not what I seek. I was raised with manners and proper etiquette has been instilled within me. 

In short something has come up where I need to have someone else with me for a bit to help make me feel secure, safe and protected while at home.
Oh and I'm going to install locks where there were none and I'm changing the others. Invasion of any kind whether it be home invasion, personal invasion or any other intrusions or acts that make a person not feel safe is pure evil, especially if it may not be a stranger. 
I'm very new to this area and haven't really met anyone yet. 
It would be nice if you know how to shoot and you wouldn't mind teaching me how to shoot. I prefer a rifle 1st before a handgun but that can be discussed. In the past I haven't had very good aim but I'm looking to improve. 

That is all I'm willing to share in reference to the circumstances I'm posting about on CL. 
I'm sitting here telling myself this is ridiculous but at this point what do I really have to lose? I definitely can sense a predator type whether they seem charming or not and my personal space and comfort zone has already been violated. 
My thoughts now are Freck it!!! I seek to have someone with me most nights until I get things sorted out. 
Also do understand I hate drama, I go out of my way to avoid drama and I do expect you to have very little drama. I'm only going to deal with the average normal % of drama that just comes with life. Otherwise stay out of my life. 
Yep, I'm not like most chics, in fact I think I'm a lot cooler than many of them. 
I'm good to those who are good to me. 
Others that I'm good to and I give them no name to place with a kind person who's helped them when in need, well that's between God and I.
So if you think you can hangout with me without too many questions asked and just enjoy one day at a time send me a response that has more than one sentence in it. 
Tell me about yourself and why I can have some initial trust in you and feel safe!?! Include a photo or I WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT RESPOND BACK!
Trust me when I say I'm highly intelligent and I'm fully aware how odd and nuts this post seems. Somethings are better not explained and that's where I stand on the subject at this time. If you are intelligent you'll have a good enough understanding on your own. 
Don't ask me my age just know I'm in my 30's, good to go!
Happy New Year!

Let's be real. Not porn star fantasy, dreams come true type crap, real life. I'm 29, blonde, curvy, intelligent, down to earth, compassionate and loving human being. 

Now you all want to bone me, right? I'm going to break that fantasy and give you a dash of reality. 

Yes, being 29 is great. I've figured myself out, know who I am and what I want from life. I have great friends, loving family, an all together great support system. Boy have I had to use them, it's been a hell of a few years. I've come out on top and people ask me how I've stayed somewhat positive and happy through it all, because the alternative sucks. So I come with some light baggage, but we all do. 

Moving on, I'm a student. Sounds great, shows I'm intelligent and hard working. That's true but the next few years are going to be crazy. There may be weeks where I can't do anything but study, go to class, drink too much coffee, and get a few hours of sleep if I'm lucky. Showering will be optional, my place will get messy, and all relationships will go on the back burner. Real life. 

Let's talk about my personality. I love it. I'm sarcastic, tell it like it is, laugh too loud, love to joke and be goofy and make people smile. I sometimes snort. My friends count on especially humorous nights. I'm strong willed and stubborn as hell. Fiercely loyal. Creative. I love to cook and take care of others. Hate cleaning. Love some crappy TV and reading. I dream of traveling. I love good wine, craft beer and sometimes a good scotch. Always wanting to learn something new. I get jealous of the hot chicks on the chive. I love museums and art. Love cats and dogs. Yes you can love both. I'm a strong, independent woman. That intimidates a lot of men. 

If you're still reading by now I'm impressed but we still have to talk about physical attractiveness. As if the above wasn't enough to swallow we still have to be physically attracted to each other. I'm fast approaching 30. I've lived life. I've stayed up too late, eaten that chocolate croissant from the French bakery, worked too hard, have had injuries and have the scars. I've always have had a great ass but it's starting to get a few dimples. Skin is not as tight as it was at 20. I say curvy but it's really a few extra pounds. When I reach my fitness goals, I won't be much smaller, I'll just have more muscle. Acne has taken root back in my life. As if being 29 and single wasn't enough. But I'm a dark blonde, great smile, green eyes, and still have many years left of a great ass to enjoy. 

On top of all that, what I'm looking for. I'm looking for my partner in life, a companion, an equal. I don't play games and loathe the dating scene of today. I would love for you to have your shit together, a good head on your shoulders, a great sense of humor and sense of compassion. A man who drives me to better myself and vice versa. A guy who is done with the crazy years and bullshit and is looking for the real thing. 

If any of that interests you, send me an email. Put your favorite place you like to travel in the title so I know you're real. Tell me about yourself and attach a picture.

I'm a positive, optimistic, fun, spontaneous person who loves to laugh, go out & see live music, theater, museums, walking, biking, flea markets...I love dining out & in (cooking too), funky bars, trivia, the beach, dancing, meeting people! One of my biggest interests is to travel more.






















I purged myself of all the pills and even some of the alcohol that I swallowed all over the floor and mostly down my shirt. She never told anyone of how she found me only held me tears running down her cheeks and whispering how much of a selfish bastard I am while petting my hair. I never felt so stupid and selfish in my life then that day I'm just glad it was her who found me and not Autumn. Here I was about to take myself out of this world and leave Kelly and more importantly my daughter Autumn alone in this world to deal with the pain of losing my wife and Autumns mother then add on the loss of her father. Ever since then the thought of suicide hasn't come to my mind much, but Kelly still keeps a close eye on me both at and off work. 

Kelly has a husband who doesn't like the fact she sometimes sleeps over on the nights where I have consistent nightmares of my wife's dying screams as she burned alive in the over turned car. I was yards away ejected from the car somehow only getting a broken leg and arm with a lot of cuts and bruises. Kelly didn't care though she still stayed by my side when ever I asked her and sometimes when I don't I'll always love her for that. 

The buzzing of my phone on my desk signaled me it's time to leave work again another day pasted by if only today was just any other day. I turned off my laptop and put some papers away before getting my coat and heading to the parking lot to meet Kelly after I punched out my shift. The sky was cloudy and looked like a storm was close so I went to stand by Kelly's car and waited for her where the air smelled fresh just like before a storm. She didn't take long I saw her across the parking lot letting her bright red hair out of her usual ponytail. ""Looks ugly outside don't it?"" She asked as we both got in her car. ""Inside here it looks beautiful."" I replied holding Kelly's hand and messaged the space between her fingers with my finger tips. 

Kelly blushed a little her pale lightly freckled skin turned a light red hue. ""Shut up, you snake charmer."" Kelly said playfully slapping my hand away. We often flirted like this to blow off steam nothing really was happening between us, I think. 

It was a bit of a ongoing joke really it started off with Kelly telling me she had a fight with her husband over her friendship with me one night a few weeks after my wife's death. The prick doesn't realize I known Kelly for half her life and even introduced them two together back in collage and if I wanted I could've fucked Kelly way before they even got together I probably still can. It started off with innocent complements at work, shared lunch breaks, and light touches after work cuddling on the couch watching American Idol before I sleep and Kelly takes off to go home usually that's as far as me and Kelly took it.

I'll start off by talking about myself. I'm Hispanic. I am 22 years old. I'm currently only working, no school. I love reading books, I usually have a book handy. I also enjoy playing video games in my free time and board games with friends and family. I do have a bit of a competitive side. I've always been a bit of a tomboy, if I don't have to dress up then I do prefer to be casual in a t-shirt and jeans. I like different kinds of music but genre wise I usually listen to rock, pop, alternative. 

And now for what I'm looking for. It might be a long shot but I am looking for someone to date and hopefully fall in love with. A man who I can joke around and laugh with. Who won't tease me too much when my favorite football team loses. Who understands that I'm an introvert and will sometimes prefer a night in than a night out. Who is kind and values family. I'm not too concerned with looks as much as I am with personality. Especially if you can make me laugh and have a good time. At the end of the day being happy is what it's about and if someone makes me happy I'd go above and beyond to also make them happy.

If your interested and read through all of that then thank you. Now the ball is in your court and I ask that you give a short ""About you""information and also answer this: Put your iPod (or any mp3) on shuffle and what are the first 5 songs :) 

Also I'm not going to send a picture if you don't send one.

I am looking for a long term relationship with a man who I feel passion, chemistry, a strong physical connection with. I have only found 1 guy in my life who I felt this way for and I am desperately craving it again. It's hard to find. It's not like being with some average person you settle for or someone with just a nice body and gorgeous smile you find hot. Its an intense connection emotionally and physically. I do believe in ""love at first sight.""

Here's the catch: I am shy, insecure, inexperienced, a little overweight and dependent. I want a man to take care of me, to boost my self esteem and compliment me regularly. To tell me and show me he wants me and not stop after a few months into the relationship and expect me to ""just know."" I need a man to help show me its ok to be me, ok to open up and let loose and not hide. Someone patient with me being inexperienced, someone non-judgmental, and someone who can motivate me to be better, to be who I want to be, to be who you want in a girl and to wow you. A guy to work out with me and be active with to push me out of my comfort zone. I can be fiesty and needy, and I need a real man who can handle it. This all seems like a lot, but I don't think its too much different than most relationship hurdles. I can be a great lover/partner to the right person.

I'd like a man who is strong, with good hygiene, has a stable income, a car, 27-40yrs old, drug and disease free, taller than 5' 7"" and preferably doesnt smoke cigarettes.

If this describes you and you think you can give me what I need, hit me up and we'll talk more. Please be honest and up front about what you're looking for and what you need, also be as detailed as possible about yourself. I am serious and dont want to waste too much time with pointless email tag. Must include a couple photos of yourself or no reply.
Thanks

Are there any drama free guys out there who just want to have a good time with an upbeat girl? Hmmm? We could go to a bar and have a couple of drinks while we talk about the bad dates lol. Should be interesting. I'm looking for friendship and more if we can keep it casual.

Hi Looking for decent (prefer blue collar) man for relationship or as friend. I really just need 1 good man who is like to me. I am pretty, nice, smart and love road trips. I workout enough to stay in shape. I'm a 60's hippie chick, with a little back damage from work and 420 helps a lot. I have fun and have a dark sense of humor. Life is short, not getting younger. Need new partner in crime(fun) Spiritual. Into paranormal. Not your average woman. I like to party, (responsibly of course). I'll meet you in daylight, in public. I also smoke, swear, and drink a little. I like to walk in the woods and go to flea markets. Love to cook. I like a man with longer hair Just my preference. I need a pic to respond. I'd be proud to display one, but literally CANT. Dont make me explain it, ask me what I look like, if you read these,instead of your phone grabbing them! Ages 44-58 about right. Looking for the one who will last. I want to listen to rock and roll all the time, unless were talking or watching a movie or doing something fun, even then, all is best with ROCK N ROLL MUSIC. Basically, a friend to go places with, when I want to go, but dont want to go alone. I'm not an escort, just looking for a boyfriend in my mid ages to go steady with!! Yeah.

I have a history in truck driving as a rider. I had a couple friends in the past that I rode with and I was in a serious relationship for a year with one. I have many friends on fb from many states, one retired, that have or are driving otr. I've been off the road a year and it's been that long since I've been in a relationship. I've been to every state and I rode fulltime 30 days to three months at a time, I've always felt that it was just like camping. I can cook on a truck and that definitely took some imagination and joining some groups for cooking otr but, it was definitely a great lifestyle most can't even think of living because it's not always easy and it is a big test on two people. I made a comment once that all couples looking to get married should have to spend at least a week or two in a semi otr and I'd bet 99% wouldn't be together afterwards.

I miss it like I miss breathing and I would like to find a man who is a trucker. I am not looking for a one time pleasure or anything of that sort. I have a good sense of humor and I always try to make the best out of every situation, I am a clean and somewhat quiet person but, I know what it means to compensate for the other in making time pass and interesting.
