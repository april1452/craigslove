I'm no queen,hence need no king(nor a slave).I'm not feminist,and you shouldn't be a misogynist.

Was born and raised in a political dynasty with strict family eduction,but definitely a mutineer.I grew up with a strong sense of justice and compassion.No tattoo,don't smoke,socially drink.Rational,precise,very good at numbers.Spontanenous but rarely go emotional.Read a lot,but not a book worm.Fond of all schools of art particularly that of the 18th and 19th centuries.

Clean,tidy,caring,fashionable,adventurous,post-modern spirit,active and innovative,well-organized,home-oriented,hard-working,excellent cook.Not a perfectionist,just being a real self.Animal lover although i'm allergic to all furry creatures(In addition to hairy men).Amateur F1 car racer,golf player.

Objectively speaking,i'm pretty good looking.Thin,but not skinny.5'8'' tall,51kg,healthy,single,no kids,achieved a model qualification after University graduation,and been an airline stewardess for a while.

I'm a forseer.Ambitious,self-driven independent business woman,looking for a mature,stable,honest guy with consistency and single-minded in love for long term relationship which could lead to marriage.You need to have a regular job,and financially secure.My ideal man should be good looking,smart,healthy both physically and mentally.Age:24-46.Single or divorced without kids.Disease/drama/EX gfs/wives FREE.Feel free to ask anything further,i will answer with complete honesty.

Please note that i'm here looking for a future husband only,not a sugar boy or dating partner.

I don't need slick praise or candlelight hymn,but a man who can fix a sofa leg when it's broken,or can cook for himself when i'm away.

Generally,a man who can solve problems and build a future together with me,not a romanticist or a theoretician.

I would rather spend most of the time with you on talking about economy and politics than clothes and perfume.

When i see problems occur,i go to solve them.Meaningless nonsense and complain doesn't make sense to me.

Patient but can't tolerate nagging people(Sticky is fine).

I'm a 3 heads and 6 legs competent woman and won't accept a man who can't match/challenge me both mentally and intellectually.

Scammers and snobbish/materialistic dudes should knock off.And if you never have the time to care about other people's feelings and needs,my suggestion is you should marry yourself.

If you're a typical selfish/egoistic/self-centered ignorant person,or looking for someone to take care of you financially/invest you personally you're just becoming a day dreamer.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

PS:I require a Skype video chat after several emails/photos exchanging,when it's time to check whether the one writing to me is true(vice versa for you).And if you fail to show up on cam,i'll stop replying and delete you.Too busy for perpetual text messages or email texting and all kinds of time wasters.

Please write your first e-mail in the self-introduction form.NO PICTURE NO REPLY.

Last but not least,VIRGO men are out of consideration.DON'T bother,save all the nice words for yourself.No preaching,no brainwash,don't scheme,you will never GAIN anything from me,go use others.

So here is some information about me. I could rattle off a lot of really great things about me, but I'm going to also toss in some bad. Because I'm looking for someone who will be genuinely interested in me and getting to know me. By no means am I just looking for some fling or to play or be played. 

I'm 30 years old. I'm tall, a little overweight, but I wear it well. I'm heavily tattooed and I have brown hair & brown eyes. I have a few piercings. I'm a mother to an awesome little boy. His father isn't in the picture, and doesn't appear to have plans to be around either. I'm a college student. I love to read, its my favorite thing to do. I'm also a Netflix junkie & I have been known to binge watch several seasons of a TV show if I become obsessed. I like to go out occasionally, but I am a home body. I also am extremely blunt and incredibly sarcastic, but I don't purposely try to hurt other peoples feelings. I have a huge heart & I care about everything, but I don't consider it a fault. I'm from Chicago & I've been here in Fort Lauderdale just over 1 year now. 

I'm looking for someone to date, be romantic with, possibly fall in love with, all that good stuff. I want to get married eventually. I don't want more kids. & at the very least, I would love to have some new friends.

Zany, adventurous, busy, funny woman seeks boyfriend. I'm pretty on bad days, but I clean up way better than that. I'm a mad yogini with an active practice and a barre lover. I box. I spin. I tried paddleboarding and didn't drown. I ran my first 5K in early October and the paramedics did not have to resuscitate me. Win! I fear my Olympic dreams now hinge upon Curling, because sliding a rock and sweeping ice don't seem to be contingent on age or fitness level. Hiking and camping can be fun but so are shopping and luxury travel. I love spa days. I cook. I read fiction. I laugh at politics. I have a job and a house and a car. I have a child and some pets. I travel for work and fun. I've been a season ticket holder for Philly sports for 22 years, but I never go to the games. I like movies and concerts. I try new things. I laugh a lot at a lot of things. I've recently decided that I might be willing to trade sexual favors for snow removal in the event of another storm.

I'm looking for someone laid back who's been beaten up by life and relationships and is still able to laugh. Of course you have baggage, and you can describe it and explain how you carry it. You're single, divorced or widowed and have been for a good while. Bonus points to men who are good dads and love kids! I am so, so, so not a rebound person. I'm not interested in anyone recently separated. You need time. I've had too much of it. You are not seeing a therapist. Three's a crowd! Also, you are NOT a therapist yourself. 

You have an education and a job and car and some interests of your own. You like animals and kids and doing stuff. Stuff should include binge-watching Netflix weekends and going out to do fun things. If you are someone who constantly needs to be doing something and hates staying put, I'm not for you. Alternately, if you're someone who doesn't want to do anything, ever, I'm not for you, either. You are able to explain the status of your preparedness for the impending zombie apocalypse as well as where you'd go if you could beam anywhere. You have a sense of humor.

You're passionate about some stuff, but you are not a zealot about anything. You listen more than you speak. You remember the good ol' days when having an opinion did not necessarily mean it was worth sharing, much less sharing as the penultimate truth to the exclusion of hearing others. You do not quote Fox News. Donald Trump is not your guy. You have a sense of social justice.

You do not have anger management issues. Your boss/ex has not suggested that you try AA. Or NA. Or AnyOtherA. You're not taking meds for psychosis or schizophrenia. You are not looking to reenact 50 Shades of Stupidity because it looked fun on the screen. You went to college. You don't say ""I'm looking for my soulmate but you wrote too much"" when you email. I've met those guys. We didn't get on so well. Literacy is super-sexy.

You are really reluctant to answer because this is CL. You are not a serial dater (or a serial killer, or really any kind of serial anything). If you are a perennial CL first responder, I'm probably not your girl.

If you smoke, you don't do it around me. Whatever recreational drugs you tried in your misspent youth are now great stories, and we won't have to stop on a street corner in Darby to pick more up if we ever go out. You have not been in a prison as a long-term guest of the county, state or federal government.

So ive come to my tried and true CL to find something extremely specific

I am a MBF looking to relocate to the miami area, that being said i have a 7 month old son, which as you can imagine makes working, let alone, moving a difficult task.

As for the married part, my husband sucks and i need to get away from him. Me and a friend will be visiting in February and my hope is to meet with a few guys (choices are lovely) and see what clicks.

A bit more about me:
Graduated from a decent university with a BA in Religion, Jersey native. 5'5 about 145lbs. I'm very open to different scenarios and dont necessarily have a ""type"". I love to cook and clean, no seriously. I am NOT looking to be anything close to a slave, im not desperate just in search of a better life for me and the babe. No ""drugs"" and certainly no disease. I can be your best match or your worst nightmare, it really depends majorly on how im treated. I would prefer to be a stay at home mother for as long as possible, or atleast until our boy turns 1. I enjoy the beach (for tanning mostly) and swimming, ofcourse the occasional puff puff pass is always appreciated.

Somethings im looking for:
A caring, gentle and extremely patient man that will hold my hand and hug me tightly. This man should LOVE kids (if things go well id like to have more) Please live alone!!! A car would be helpful, but i do have my own that i would consider to take down with me. I prefer a taller man, but im certainly not picky. Whatever race, whatever religion as long as youre open as well. No slackers or druggies, no old dirty men trying to lock me away in the basement.

Im throwing up a prayer and hoping this message reaches the right guy in time. Even if your arent sure about a longterm romantic relationship, perhaps we could just begin as good friends. Really just need a good, nice, hardworking individual thats willing to lend a helping hand. 

PLEASE note i will NOT send pictures until some real conversation is established, im serious about this and i hope you will be too.

The hottest thing on earth is the Sun......so with that being said im not the hottest thing on earth. So if you looking for that I will give you the Sun phone number you can netflix n chill with it. 
I am average girl next door
I am just looking for a friend hoping for more but no pressure. I like movies, dinner, casino, and just hanging out whether going for a drive to orlando or just staying in and watch a movie and cuddle. I am boring all I do is go to work and stay home. Thats because I have no one to do things with. ""Popcorn for one please"" sound really sad to me. So if you looking for a friend to go eat with and play the slots with or just watch the latest movie with get at me. Im not offering sex but I still have the Sun number if you want to fuck something hot. 
If you are a cool guy down to earth and laidback looking for a friend and have same interest as me please reply changing the subject Sun so I know you read the ad and we go from there.

Hi, I'm not on here to play games. So, if that's what your about please move on to another ad. I actually want to meet someone, who's ready for I have to offer.

I am a positive thinker and somewhat a spiritual person. Both of these are what makes me different from most females. I like cooking, doing laundry, shopping (whether its for both clothes and food), sometimes cleaning and relaxing. I'm not the type of person who likes arguments but I like having healthy progressive conversations. I'm a down to earth person who ain't afraid of speaking my mind or admit when I am wrong. 

I like positive and ambitious persons.

What I look for in a guy.

Someone who is open, responsible, honest, kind, reliable, helpful, tall( 5' 10 or taller) and ambitious. Someone who knows that it takes two for any relationship to work successfully. 

If you think you can manage my needs and want to know more about me, you can email me and tell your thoughts on how a relationship should be and also you're needs from a potential companion.

Hoping to meet someone who is wanting a long term relationship with the possibility of marriage in the future. We need to make sure we have some things in common. I'm actually always open to meet people who have different interests than I do because it's always a great way to learn about/experience something new. Here's some info about me:

- I work a full-time at a professional job.
- The worst job I ever had was cleaning airplane food trays!
- My friends and family would consider my best attribute to be my sincerity.
- I had my first crush at age five on my cousin's cousin.
- My favorite subject in school growing up was journalism!
- If I had one wish for the world it would be: that we could all live and let live!
- My favorite movie is The Shawshank Redemption.
-I have brown hair, blue eyes, am 5'2"" and considered a BBW

I am looking for someone:

-Professional
-Personable
-Who will go to the movies and out to dinner with me!
-Who knows how to take care of himself (financially, mentally, and emotionally). I do it, so should you.
-Can enjoy the simple things in life and has an optimistic outlook.
-Knows how to be kind to people and appreciate what he has.
-Who has a sense of humor and can hold a conversation about anything!

In my free time I enjoy binge watching Netflix, crocheting, taking photos, and long walks along the river front. I love going to movies, listening to music, playing a board or card game and just hanging out with friends or family. There's not much I enjoy more than a good conversation and laugh with with someone special.

My ideal date would be something fun! Dinner, maybe a movie, a drive around town sight seeing and sharing our favorite spots is always a good way to get to know someone.

I'm looking to start a romance. Hopefully long term, maybe for the rest of our lives. Please be between the ages of 40 and 55 and willing to take the time needed to get to know someone.

Please reply with more than just a, ""hello."" My reply of, ""hey"" isn't going to get us very far. Tell me something that will make me want to reply to you first before anyone else! Put your favorite movie in the subject line so your message doesn't get sent directly to the SPAM folder!

1st let me say I'm a totally cool chic, college educated, have had some absolute amazing positions in my career that most only dream about. I've learned that a career isn't what makes a person special no matter what others tell you. 
I'm actually more humble and kind than I am arrogant and uncaring of others thoughts and feelings.

So here comes the difficult part and never in a million years did I ever think I'd be in a situation where I would be seeking something a bit unorthodox. 
Bare with me while I gather my thoughts and try to cautiously govern what I'm about to say...............
I'd like to meet an attractive man between the age of 29-37
You must be a Non Smoker
Have a solid job or career
Own your own vehicle
Be completely straight 
Fully believe in God (Christian) not atheist, agnostic or anything else that I might of forgotten to list, oh did I say and not into anything Satanic? Yikes
You Must be healthy and range from fit to average 
If you are Military affiliated that works for me since my background is Military. Military just seems to mesh better with other Military types.

If you like dogs that's cool since I'm thinking about getting one. 
I have a cool pad, my own vehicle and my own income. 
I'm average looking and I'm considered attractive average. I believe confidence and high self esteem go a long way and make a difference. 
I don't drink, do drugs and I'm 100% positive I am disease free so you be too.

I'm a chic that can clock anyone, female or male if need be. However brawls are not what I seek. I was raised with manners and proper etiquette has been instilled within me. 

In short something has come up where I need to have someone else with me for a bit to help make me feel secure, safe and protected while at home.
Oh and I'm going to install locks where there were none and I'm changing the others. Invasion of any kind whether it be home invasion, personal invasion or any other intrusions or acts that make a person not feel safe is pure evil, especially if it may not be a stranger. 
I'm very new to this area and haven't really met anyone yet. 
It would be nice if you know how to shoot and you wouldn't mind teaching me how to shoot. I prefer a rifle 1st before a handgun but that can be discussed. In the past I haven't had very good aim but I'm looking to improve. 

That is all I'm willing to share in reference to the circumstances I'm posting about on CL. 
I'm sitting here telling myself this is ridiculous but at this point what do I really have to lose? I definitely can sense a predator type whether they seem charming or not and my personal space and comfort zone has already been violated. 
My thoughts now are Freck it!!! I seek to have someone with me most nights until I get things sorted out. 
Also do understand I hate drama, I go out of my way to avoid drama and I do expect you to have very little drama. I'm only going to deal with the average normal % of drama that just comes with life. Otherwise stay out of my life. 
Yep, I'm not like most chics, in fact I think I'm a lot cooler than many of them. 
I'm good to those who are good to me. 
Others that I'm good to and I give them no name to place with a kind person who's helped them when in need, well that's between God and I.
So if you think you can hangout with me without too many questions asked and just enjoy one day at a time send me a response that has more than one sentence in it. 
Tell me about yourself and why I can have some initial trust in you and feel safe!?! Include a photo or I WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT RESPOND BACK!
Trust me when I say I'm highly intelligent and I'm fully aware how odd and nuts this post seems. Somethings are better not explained and that's where I stand on the subject at this time. If you are intelligent you'll have a good enough understanding on your own. 
Don't ask me my age just know I'm in my 30's, good to go!
Happy New Year!

Let's be real. Not porn star fantasy, dreams come true type crap, real life. I'm 29, blonde, curvy, intelligent, down to earth, compassionate and loving human being. 

Now you all want to bone me, right? I'm going to break that fantasy and give you a dash of reality. 

Yes, being 29 is great. I've figured myself out, know who I am and what I want from life. I have great friends, loving family, an all together great support system. Boy have I had to use them, it's been a hell of a few years. I've come out on top and people ask me how I've stayed somewhat positive and happy through it all, because the alternative sucks. So I come with some light baggage, but we all do. 

Moving on, I'm a student. Sounds great, shows I'm intelligent and hard working. That's true but the next few years are going to be crazy. There may be weeks where I can't do anything but study, go to class, drink too much coffee, and get a few hours of sleep if I'm lucky. Showering will be optional, my place will get messy, and all relationships will go on the back burner. Real life. 

Let's talk about my personality. I love it. I'm sarcastic, tell it like it is, laugh too loud, love to joke and be goofy and make people smile. I sometimes snort. My friends count on especially humorous nights. I'm strong willed and stubborn as hell. Fiercely loyal. Creative. I love to cook and take care of others. Hate cleaning. Love some crappy TV and reading. I dream of traveling. I love good wine, craft beer and sometimes a good scotch. Always wanting to learn something new. I get jealous of the hot chicks on the chive. I love museums and art. Love cats and dogs. Yes you can love both. I'm a strong, independent woman. That intimidates a lot of men. 

If you're still reading by now I'm impressed but we still have to talk about physical attractiveness. As if the above wasn't enough to swallow we still have to be physically attracted to each other. I'm fast approaching 30. I've lived life. I've stayed up too late, eaten that chocolate croissant from the French bakery, worked too hard, have had injuries and have the scars. I've always have had a great ass but it's starting to get a few dimples. Skin is not as tight as it was at 20. I say curvy but it's really a few extra pounds. When I reach my fitness goals, I won't be much smaller, I'll just have more muscle. Acne has taken root back in my life. As if being 29 and single wasn't enough. But I'm a dark blonde, great smile, green eyes, and still have many years left of a great ass to enjoy. 

On top of all that, what I'm looking for. I'm looking for my partner in life, a companion, an equal. I don't play games and loathe the dating scene of today. I would love for you to have your shit together, a good head on your shoulders, a great sense of humor and sense of compassion. A man who drives me to better myself and vice versa. A guy who is done with the crazy years and bullshit and is looking for the real thing. 

If any of that interests you, send me an email. Put your favorite place you like to travel in the title so I know you're real. Tell me about yourself and attach a picture.

I'm a positive, optimistic, fun, spontaneous person who loves to laugh, go out & see live music, theater, museums, walking, biking, flea markets...I love dining out & in (cooking too), funky bars, trivia, the beach, dancing, meeting people! One of my biggest interests is to travel more.






















I purged myself of all the pills and even some of the alcohol that I swallowed all over the floor and mostly down my shirt. She never told anyone of how she found me only held me tears running down her cheeks and whispering how much of a selfish bastard I am while petting my hair. I never felt so stupid and selfish in my life then that day I'm just glad it was her who found me and not Autumn. Here I was about to take myself out of this world and leave Kelly and more importantly my daughter Autumn alone in this world to deal with the pain of losing my wife and Autumns mother then add on the loss of her father. Ever since then the thought of suicide hasn't come to my mind much, but Kelly still keeps a close eye on me both at and off work. 

Kelly has a husband who doesn't like the fact she sometimes sleeps over on the nights where I have consistent nightmares of my wife's dying screams as she burned alive in the over turned car. I was yards away ejected from the car somehow only getting a broken leg and arm with a lot of cuts and bruises. Kelly didn't care though she still stayed by my side when ever I asked her and sometimes when I don't I'll always love her for that. 

The buzzing of my phone on my desk signaled me it's time to leave work again another day pasted by if only today was just any other day. I turned off my laptop and put some papers away before getting my coat and heading to the parking lot to meet Kelly after I punched out my shift. The sky was cloudy and looked like a storm was close so I went to stand by Kelly's car and waited for her where the air smelled fresh just like before a storm. She didn't take long I saw her across the parking lot letting her bright red hair out of her usual ponytail. ""Looks ugly outside don't it?"" She asked as we both got in her car. ""Inside here it looks beautiful."" I replied holding Kelly's hand and messaged the space between her fingers with my finger tips. 

Kelly blushed a little her pale lightly freckled skin turned a light red hue. ""Shut up, you snake charmer."" Kelly said playfully slapping my hand away. We often flirted like this to blow off steam nothing really was happening between us, I think. 

It was a bit of a ongoing joke really it started off with Kelly telling me she had a fight with her husband over her friendship with me one night a few weeks after my wife's death. The prick doesn't realize I known Kelly for half her life and even introduced them two together back in collage and if I wanted I could've fucked Kelly way before they even got together I probably still can. It started off with innocent complements at work, shared lunch breaks, and light touches after work cuddling on the couch watching American Idol before I sleep and Kelly takes off to go home usually that's as far as me and Kelly took it.

Wouldn't be nice to have a woman by your side who is charming, gorgeous, and respectful? A lady who is beautiful inside a out? A woman who appreciates you for everything that you do for her?
Take a chance. Let's indulge life with a bottle of our choice and experience our dreams and goals, together.

I'm loyal honest and hard working . I'm currently working part-time as customer service supervisor and going to FIU my major is Psychology. I'm friendly sweet and funny . I like to cuddle and enjoy the little things in life. I would like to travel around the world. Like to sing while driving and dance while cleaning. I'm very compassionate of others and like to do volunteer work. Love any genre of music and concerts/opera/theater. I'm looking for someone I can become friends with and go to music festivals, concerts and any awesome events and hopefully turn into a relationship. Someone who is willing and not afraid to fall in love .Someone who will be happy and excited to create new adventures with me and who will show me off to the people that matter to him. A guy who values family and God in their life and has his priorities straight. A guy who is ambitious enough to know his goals and is working hard to accomplish them. No players I'm looking for something serious meaningful and real, no hook ups. I just want someone who wants to know the true meaning of unconditional love and is ready to settle down.It would be a super plus if you like EDM (Electronic Dance Music) and likes to rave ;) Plur life! 👍

I'll start off by talking about myself. I'm Hispanic. I am 22 years old. I'm currently only working, no school. I love reading books, I usually have a book handy. I also enjoy playing video games in my free time and board games with friends and family. I do have a bit of a competitive side. I've always been a bit of a tomboy, if I don't have to dress up then I do prefer to be casual in a t-shirt and jeans. I like different kinds of music but genre wise I usually listen to rock, pop, alternative. 

And now for what I'm looking for. It might be a long shot but I am looking for someone to date and hopefully fall in love with. A man who I can joke around and laugh with. Who won't tease me too much when my favorite football team loses. Who understands that I'm an introvert and will sometimes prefer a night in than a night out. Who is kind and values family. I'm not too concerned with looks as much as I am with personality. Especially if you can make me laugh and have a good time. At the end of the day being happy is what it's about and if someone makes me happy I'd go above and beyond to also make them happy.

If your interested and read through all of that then thank you. Now the ball is in your court and I ask that you give a short ""About you""information and also answer this: Put your iPod (or any mp3) on shuffle and what are the first 5 songs :) 

Also I'm not going to send a picture if you don't send one.

I am looking for a long term relationship with a man who I feel passion, chemistry, a strong physical connection with. I have only found 1 guy in my life who I felt this way for and I am desperately craving it again. It's hard to find. It's not like being with some average person you settle for or someone with just a nice body and gorgeous smile you find hot. Its an intense connection emotionally and physically. I do believe in ""love at first sight.""

Here's the catch: I am shy, insecure, inexperienced, a little overweight and dependent. I want a man to take care of me, to boost my self esteem and compliment me regularly. To tell me and show me he wants me and not stop after a few months into the relationship and expect me to ""just know."" I need a man to help show me its ok to be me, ok to open up and let loose and not hide. Someone patient with me being inexperienced, someone non-judgmental, and someone who can motivate me to be better, to be who I want to be, to be who you want in a girl and to wow you. A guy to work out with me and be active with to push me out of my comfort zone. I can be fiesty and needy, and I need a real man who can handle it. This all seems like a lot, but I don't think its too much different than most relationship hurdles. I can be a great lover/partner to the right person.

I'd like a man who is strong, with good hygiene, has a stable income, a car, 27-40yrs old, drug and disease free, taller than 5' 7"" and preferably doesnt smoke cigarettes.

If this describes you and you think you can give me what I need, hit me up and we'll talk more. Please be honest and up front about what you're looking for and what you need, also be as detailed as possible about yourself. I am serious and dont want to waste too much time with pointless email tag. Must include a couple photos of yourself or no reply.
Thanks

Hi Looking for decent (prefer blue collar) man for relationship or as friend. I really just need 1 good man who is like to me. I am pretty, nice, smart and love road trips. I workout enough to stay in shape. I'm a 60's hippie chick, with a little back damage from work and 420 helps a lot. I have fun and have a dark sense of humor. Life is short, not getting younger. Need new partner in crime(fun) Spiritual. Into paranormal. Not your average woman. I like to party, (responsibly of course). I'll meet you in daylight, in public. I also smoke, swear, and drink a little. I like to walk in the woods and go to flea markets. Love to cook. I like a man with longer hair Just my preference. I need a pic to respond. I'd be proud to display one, but literally CANT. Dont make me explain it, ask me what I look like, if you read these,instead of your phone grabbing them! Ages 44-58 about right. Looking for the one who will last. I want to listen to rock and roll all the time, unless were talking or watching a movie or doing something fun, even then, all is best with ROCK N ROLL MUSIC. Basically, a friend to go places with, when I want to go, but dont want to go alone. I'm not an escort, just looking for a boyfriend in my mid ages to go steady with!! Yeah.

I have a history in truck driving as a rider. I had a couple friends in the past that I rode with and I was in a serious relationship for a year with one. I have many friends on fb from many states, one retired, that have or are driving otr. I've been off the road a year and it's been that long since I've been in a relationship. I've been to every state and I rode fulltime 30 days to three months at a time, I've always felt that it was just like camping. I can cook on a truck and that definitely took some imagination and joining some groups for cooking otr but, it was definitely a great lifestyle most can't even think of living because it's not always easy and it is a big test on two people. I made a comment once that all couples looking to get married should have to spend at least a week or two in a semi otr and I'd bet 99% wouldn't be together afterwards.

I miss it like I miss breathing and I would like to find a man who is a trucker. I am not looking for a one time pleasure or anything of that sort. I have a good sense of humor and I always try to make the best out of every situation, I am a clean and somewhat quiet person but, I know what it means to compensate for the other in making time pass and interesting.

Hello there, gentlemen!

Let's keep this short and sweet. I'm a successful, family-oriented, cultured, educated, intelligent, and funny young lady. I appreciate people who are charismatic and have a great sense of humor (sarcasm is my third language, lol). I enjoy being intellectually stimulated before I even consider taking off my clothes. I'd like to meet a man who's in a point in their life where they can appreciate a gal like me and take her on an adventure where we get to know each other and have fun. I'm realistic about dating, I'm not gonna marry you tomorrow, I believe in getting comfortable with the person and building a foundation for the relationship before jumping into something so serious. I like a man who's confident, taller than me, witty, smart, has a gorgeous smile, and nice eyes. I'm not gonna lie, I am a bit of a sucker for light eyes and a man in uniform, but I don't really have a set type. I just want a man that won't play games and take my time for granted. 

If you're interested, drop me a line and we can take it from there. 

PS. I'm posting a vague picture of myself on purpose, lol. Also, I'd like a man between 30-40.

Well dressed and groomed are required. While I don't mind a man who can look good in street clothes, you must be comfortable gracing the world in a fine tailored suit! No exceptions considering I enjoy dressing up and looking great as well. While I am looking for someone who exerts confidence in his attire, I am also looking for someone with a spicy personality who can engage and keep up with my style.

Spontaneity is a must as well! Some of my best ideas come at the last minute so you must be on your toes for this. However, if you are a busy gentleman with a tight schedule, I am understanding and a patient woman; we can make this work either way.

My ideal date is one where we go to a sporting event where we can enjoy ourselves sitting in the VIP sky boxes or indulge on various selections of wine (I'm a red kind of woman). If you are a member of an exclusive wine club, you are already a step ahead of me.


Please know I am very appreciative of a man who knows what he wants and goes after it. That kind of genuine confidence is hard to find and it is quite the aphrodisiac when it crosses my path.



I will include a little background around myself: I am a aspiring young professional. I say aspiring because I feel as though my current work experiences has helped shape my drive to succeed in corporate America. I am open to advise on this since the man I am seeking is a mentor and a lover.

I grew up in a large and religious and traditional family. I was practically given my education by my parents until 16. I learned what standards, honest, and loyalty meant because of them. In my private life, I am reserved, so the people I let in I truly care about. I love people and treat everyone with respect (including the people who don't deserve it). I love to dress up, travel, shop, eat, cook, listen to music, go to play, go to sporting events, and dance! This goes without saying but I am open to most things. I try to take in from others as much as I can and apply it to what I want from life. In the end I make my own happiness but would like someone to share that with



I would prefer you to be older (40+). Do not let my age fool you, as I am a mature young woman who's personality is stimulated and enriched by a man with experience. I ask that if you do decide to email me you title your email ""Cultured"" include a photo of yourself, a description of the things you enjoy. I look forward to reading and responding to those who are serious about finding someone exceptional to spoil and care for.


Yes I am the women in the photos, I have no problem proving my identity through phone or Skype

I enjoy traveling so traveling to meet the right person is never a problem!

Hello future lover! I am a cute, sweet and fun woman in an open marriage looking for companionship in my home when my husband goes out of town. However, I'm not just looking for a ""boy toy"" or a hookup. I prefer someone I can actually be friends with and go out and have fun with on occasion, so we need to have some common interests and more than just a physical connection. Some of my interests include art (especially photography), music (particularly indie rock and chill/downtempo EDM), movies (comedies and indie flicks), books (memoirs and biographies), esoteric subject matter (astrology, Tarot, meditation), craft beer and good food.

I am in my mid-30s, petite with soft and ample curves (I'm not a BBW but I'm not HWP either), short hair and tattoos. I'm a highly sensual and romantic woman with a quirky side and a twisted sense of humor. 

I am looking for someone in their early to mid-20s with similar interests to me who is creative, soulful, genuine and respectful. Someone who has a good life going for them with big dreams and goals who is working hard to achieve them and therefore doesn't really have the time they know is needed to devote to a long-term relationship. I'd like to give you the girlfriend experience without the commitment. If you are a virgin or very sexually inexperienced, I welcome you to reach out to me. 

I realize I'm asking for the sun, moon and stars here but if I can find what I'm looking for then I think this could be something very special for both of us. If this post resonates with you, please send me a message letting me know a little about yourself and what in my ad stood out to you the most. Also, please include a nice pic (no dick pics, please!). I'm not superficial but I am a photographer and very visual so the right picture will tell me more than just what you look like. No pic, no reply. 

I hope to hear from you soon! xo

I'm no queen,hence need no king(nor a slave).I'm not feminist,and you shouldn't be a misogynist.

Was born and raised in a political dynasty with strict family eduction,but definitely a mutineer.I grew up with a strong sense of justice and compassion.No tattoo,don't smoke,socially drink.Rational,precise,very good at numbers.Spontanenous but rarely go emotional.Read a lot,but not a book worm.Fond of all schools of art particularly that of the 18th and 19th centuries.

Clean,tidy,caring,fashionable,adventurous,post-modern spirit,active and innovative,well-organized,home-oriented,hard-working,excellent cook.Not a perfectionist,just being a real self.Animal lover although i'm allergic to all furry creatures(In addition to hairy men).Amateur F1 car racer,golf player.

Objectively speaking,i'm pretty good looking.Thin,but not skinny.5'8'' tall,51kg,healthy,single,no kids,achieved a model qualification after University graduation,and been an airline stewardess for a while.

I'm a forseer.Ambitious,self-driven independent business woman,looking for a mature,stable,honest guy with consistency and single-minded in love for long term relationship which could lead to marriage.You need to have a regular job,and financially secure.My ideal man should be good looking,smart,healthy both physically and mentally.Age:24-46.Single or divorced without kids.Disease/drama/EX gfs/wives FREE.Feel free to ask anything further,i will answer with complete honesty.

Please note that i'm here looking for a future husband only,not a sugar boy or dating partner.

I don't need slick praise or candlelight hymn,but a man who can fix a sofa leg when it's broken,or can cook for himself when i'm away.

Generally,a man who can solve problems and build a future together with me,not a romanticist or a theoretician.

I would rather spend most of the time with you on talking about economy and politics than clothes and perfume.

When i see problems occur,i go to solve them.Meaningless nonsense and complain doesn't make sense to me.

Patient but can't tolerate nagging people(Sticky is fine).

I'm a 3 heads and 6 legs competent woman and won't accept a man who can't match/challenge me both mentally and intellectually.

Scammers and snobbish/materialistic dudes should knock off.And if you never have the time to care about other people's feelings and needs,my suggestion is you should marry yourself.

If you're a typical selfish/egoistic/self-centered ignorant person,or looking for someone to take care of you financially/invest you personally you're just becoming a day dreamer.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

PS:I require a Skype video chat after several emails/photos exchanging,when it's time to check whether the one writing to me is true(vice versa for you).And if you fail to show up on cam,i'll stop replying and delete you.Too busy for perpetual text messages or email texting and all kinds of time wasters.

Hi!
I want to share so much with you about me. 
I'm looking for a nice men who is dependable. Have a great sense of humor because I do -:)
Like the outdoors: biking,walking,go to to the beach . Just have a great time and be kind and patients. Also PLEASE!!!!!! Don't smoke or do DRUGS!!!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!
Established and have a great job. I work but I'll make sure we can see each other when the time is coming. I won't let my job effect my personal happiness or freedom.
Have your own transportation because I have mine. That way it's easier to get together.
If you don't leave on Miami Beach don't worry about it. We can work it out. Be nice if you don't leave very far from me.
I guess if the right person is reading my ad. The person got it and will understand me.
I was born and raised in Europe. I been traveled a lot all in my life from the very young age.
I have a blonde hair(colored) My son moved away last year and I found him gone far away I'm missed him and realized I'm somewhat lonely. Like we had Valentines day. Wasn't a best day of my life.
In the future more holidays will come and I don't want to be alone. 
My little family which reduced to my two brothers are not in Miami.
The older is in Vancouver Canada. The younger in Budapest(Hungary)
So Skype is helping but the hours difference between us not always working out.
So at the moment I'm telling you I have no Family in Miami.
Good friends moved away. The once stayed in Miami Spanish speaking and I can't talk to them like a friend to a friend without a translator. Not comfortable.
I left out my age.
I'm 57 years young. Looking 35(honestly)I like all the people and don't judge the age. I sent more picture of my life than I planned to. So this is an introduction about me. This way you can see a bit of my life style. And get to know me much better. Obviously I would like you to send at least one picture of you. The most recent.!!
156 pnds. wich will go back to 135-130. I had to lay on my back for almost 2 months.I got injured and I couldn't go to the GYM. Now I went back. And I go as often as possible.But I taking it easy because my injury happened while worked out. I hurt my back. Physical therapy helped.
So I stop here. And hopefully you will get back to me when ever you are ready.
M

So here is some information about me. I could rattle off a lot of really great things about me, but I'm going to also toss in some bad. Because I'm looking for someone who will be genuinely interested in me and getting to know me. By no means am I just looking for some fling or to play or be played. I do not want nude photos & if you're genuinely curious about me, please send a photo so I can see who I'm taking with. 

I'm 30 years old. I'm tall, a little overweight, but I wear it well. I'm heavily tattooed and I have brown hair & brown eyes. I have a few piercings. I'm a mother to an awesome little boy. His father isn't in the picture, and doesn't appear to have plans to be around. I'm a college student, lots of studying & late nights in my future. I love to read, its my favorite thing to do. I'm also a Netflix junkie & I have been known to binge watch several seasons of a TV show if I become obsessed. I like to go out occasionally, but I am a home body. I also am extremely blunt and incredibly sarcastic, but I don't purposely try to hurt other peoples feelings. I have a huge heart & I care about everything, but I don't consider it a fault. I'm very independent, but I also would like a partner who can see when I need to be taken care of. I'm from Chicago & I've been here in Fort Lauderdale just over 1 year now. I love to travel & spontaneous trips happen on occasion. 

I'm looking for someone to date, be romantic with, possibly fall in love with, all that good stuff. I want to get married eventually. I don't want more kids. & at the very least, I would love to have some new friends.

I'll start off by saying a little about myself. Hopefully it'll peak your interest.
I am 5'6, full figured, and I have long burgundy hair and light blue eyes that switch up according to my mood.
I have 13 tattoos.
My doctors have me on disability for the time being until we can get my migraines and anxiety under control. And in the mean time I plan on trying to get back into school. I'm considering going for Early Childhood Paraprofessional Technology, Accounting, and/or Business Management.
I live in the country on 5 acres that is joined to 5 more acres that my aunt just purchased from my brother. My mom lives with me. She could probably do fine on her own but I feel better about her safety knowing she's here.
I have 3 medium sized dogs and 5 cats. They're all spoiled rotten.

I'm sure there is more I could add about myself but that would take away from getting to know someone.

A little bit of what I'm looking for in a partner...
No offense but preferably under 40 years old. Someone who has their head screwed on right and who knows what they want in their life and are attempting to get there.
I like to be playful so I would hope that you would be/can be also. It doesn't matter to me if you have children or not, just as long as you're single. I have 2 handsome God sons. I love kiddos!
Please be able to handle sarcasm, it's my second language....my entire family are fairly sarcastic as well. All in good fun.
I would be lying if I said that physical appearance didn't matter but it somewhat does. I apologize for that. I'm typically attracted to taller men, the taller the better. A thin/slender build is nice.

If you do decide that you're interested please send a picture with your email and I'll return the favor.
In the subject line please put your age and zodiac sign. =)

What is the best man? The man who is loving and loved. Am I right? So, my preference is a person who is ready to give love and at the same time ready to receive it in return. I need a man of his word, who is ready to create a family and devote life to his wife and beloved one. His heart should be fully mine and he will have my heart in return. Of course I like men who are romantic and gentle. Moments of love, romantic surprises and tender kisses is what I need in my life. And what about you?

Here's the truth about where all the great, single girls in SoFlo are ... anywhere except on Craigs List. Why, because the Hookers, Pimps, Web Cam and Scammers have taken over Craigs List. They totally manipulate the ads. Any decent girl has her ad flagged typically in less than 30 mins. Why? Because now your choices just became very limited.

Sexy, cute, single local women are now using websites like Plenty of Fish, Match, Tinder ... where most of them have profile pics of potential dates. I would encourage you explore other websites for finding a potential date.

As a ""normal"", single woman, when I look on LTR, I do not want to see pics of naked people or hear about weird, sexual shit you're into. That's why they have the Casual Encounters section in Craigs List for weirdos like you to use. So please, use it!

It's so sad that Craigs List personal ads have come to this.

I'm no queen,hence need no king(nor a slave).I'm not feminist,and you shouldn't be a misogynist.

Was born and raised in a political dynasty with strict family eduction,but definitely a mutineer.I grew up with a strong sense of justice and compassion.No tattoo,don't smoke,socially drink.Rational,precise,very good at numbers.Spontanenous but rarely go emotional.Read a lot,but not a book worm.Fond of all schools of art particularly that of the 18th and 19th centuries.

Clean,tidy,caring,fashionable,adventurous,post-modern spirit,active and innovative,well-organized,home-oriented,hard-working,excellent cook.Not a perfectionist,just being a real self.Animal lover although i'm allergic to all furry creatures(In addition to hairy men).Amateur F1 car racer,golf player.

Objectively speaking,i'm pretty good looking.Thin,but not skinny.5'8'' tall,51kg,healthy,single,no kids,achieved a model qualification after University graduation,and been an airline stewardess for a while.

I'm a forseer.Ambitious,self-driven independent business woman,looking for a mature,stable,honest guy with consistency and single-minded in love for long term relationship which could lead to marriage.You need to have a regular job,and financially secure.My ideal man should be good looking,smart,healthy both physically and mentally.Age:24-46.Single or divorced without kids.Disease/drama/EX gfs/wives FREE.Feel free to ask anything further,i will answer with complete honesty.

Please note that i'm here looking for a future husband only,not a sugar boy or dating partner.

I don't need slick praise or candlelight hymn,but a man who can fix a sofa leg when it's broken,or can cook for himself when i'm away.

Generally,a man who can solve problems and build a future together with me,not a romanticist or a theoretician.

I would rather spend most of the time with you on talking about economy and politics than clothes and perfume.

When i see problems occur,i go to solve them.Meaningless nonsense and complain doesn't make sense to me.

Patient but can't tolerate nagging people(Sticky is fine).

I'm a 3 heads and 6 legs competent woman and won't accept a man who can't match/challenge me both mentally and intellectually.

Scammers and snobbish/materialistic dudes should knock off.And if you never have the time to care about other people's feelings and needs,my suggestion is you should marry yourself.

If you're a typical selfish/egoistic/self-centered ignorant person,or looking for someone to take care of you financially/invest you personally you're just becoming a day dreamer.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

PS:I require a Skype video chat after several emails/photos exchanging,when it's time to check whether the one writing to me is true(vice versa for you).And if you fail to show up on cam,i'll stop replying and delete you.Too busy for perpetual text messages or email texting and all kinds of time wasters.

Please write your first e-mail in the self-introduction form.No picture no reply.

A few posts recently got to me and I wanted to speak up. It doesn't seem worth responding directly as everyone seems to be someone else here. I have had some invigorating experiences just not quite sure with who. Not to sound negative because this is coming from an uplifting place. The original post was long and nicely thought out with a beautiful emotion that came with it. The post was about intimacy, my favorite subject lately. I believe you have to have had a special relationship to know what intimacy is but you don't have to have had one to want it. It is something to strive for I feel. It is something that I respect yet somehow desire to connect with when I see it live and in color. I want to be around it, I am fascinated by it. It must be different for everyone. It can capture your thoughts and define your fantasies when it's layered with history. To me it is two people in love or even one person that you know is in love or you want them to be. I crave the fairytale for others not necessarily for me because I am not ready for it again yet. I have major goals and am responsible for others, I cannot fall in love now but I am comforted by this love of yours. I seek to understand and just be held by its presence. It is the man standing up for his loved ones, keeping his eyes to himself, caring for others deeply and being polite to his friends and colleagues all while not making his partner feel that he/she has to have every woman's or man's attention. Noticing little things that people that have developed a life together do, feeds me fully. I have been blessed with multi course portions fed to me thankfully but I have also been disheartened by love with too much unbridled charisma and charm. I was included me in everything but sometimes I would have rather not see how he connected a little too adoringly to a few too many. It is a gift, but you have to use it intelligently and with special regard to your love. I turned it around and made it a challenge for me to be able to handle any and all of this because this was what my love seemed to want and need. Thankfully, I became numb to the flirtation but at the same time became numb to our connection. I still love him it is just different now. We can love endlessly so many, we just need to respect and understand how intimacy can atrophy when we don't obey the complexity nestled in the love layers of the brain. Intimacy we want in order to develop deep, lasting experiences that become eye contact, hand holding and kissing that when done right, leads to lifelong tears worthy love making. It all comes from, he loves me enough to control himself, to make me a priority with no question about it. No hoes are going to ruin that, you won't let them. That is lifelong, I'm so grateful when I see it.

Objectively speaking,i'm pretty good looking.Thin,but not skinny.5'8'' tall,51kg,healthy,single,no kids,achieved a model qualification after University graduation,and been an airline stewardess for a while.

I'm a forseer.Ambitious,self-driven independent business woman,looking for a mature,stable,honest guy with consistency and single-minded in love for long term relationship which could lead to marriage.You need to have a regular job,and financially secure.My ideal man should be good looking,smart,healthy both physically and mentally.Age:24-46.Single or divorced without kids.Disease/drama/EX gfs/wives FREE.Feel free to ask anything further,i will answer with complete honesty.

Please note that i'm here looking for a future husband only,not a sugar boy or dating partner.

I don't need slick praise or candlelight hymn,but a man who can fix a sofa leg when it's broken,or can cook for himself when i'm away.

Generally,a man who can solve problems and build a future together with me,not a romanticist or a theoretician.

I would rather spend most of the time with you on talking about economy and politics than clothes and perfume.

When i see problems occur,i go to solve them.Meaningless nonsense and complain doesn't make sense to me.

Patient but can't tolerate nagging people(Sticky is fine).

I'm a 3 heads and 6 legs competent woman and won't accept a man who can't match/challenge me both mentally and intellectually.

Scammers and snobbish/materialistic dudes should knock off.And if you never have the time to care about other people's feelings and needs,my suggestion is you should marry yourself.

If you're a typical selfish/egoistic/self-centered ignorant person,or looking for someone to take care of you financially/invest you personally you're just becoming a day dreamer.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

PS:I require a Skype video chat after several emails/photos exchanging,when it's time to check whether the one writing to me is true(vice versa for you).And if you fail to show up on cam,i'll stop replying and delete you.Too busy for perpetual text messages or email texting and all kinds of time wasters.

I'll start off by saying a little about myself. Hopefully it'll peak your interest.
I am 5'6, full figured, and I have long burgundy hair and light blue eyes that switch up according to my mood.
I have 13 tattoos.
My doctors have me on disability for the time being until we can get my migraines and anxiety under control. And in the mean time I plan on trying to get back into school. I'm considering going for Early Childhood Paraprofessional Technology, Accounting, and/or Business Management.
I live in the country on 5 acres that is joined to 5 more acres that my aunt just purchased from my brother. My mom lives with me. She could probably do fine on her own but I feel better about her safety knowing she's here.
I have 3 medium sized dogs and 5 cats. They're all spoiled rotten.

I'm sure there is more I could add about myself but that would take away from getting to know someone.

A little bit of what I'm looking for in a partner...
No offense but preferably under 40 years old. Someone who has their head screwed on right and who knows what they want in their life and are attempting to get there.
I like to be playful so I would hope that you would be/can be also. It doesn't matter to me if you have children or not, just as long as you're single. I have 2 handsome God sons. I love kiddos!
Please be able to handle sarcasm, it's my second language....my entire family are fairly sarcastic as well. All in good fun.
I would be lying if I said that physical appearance didn't matter but it somewhat does. I apologize for that. I'm typically attracted to taller men, the taller the better. A thin/slender build is nice.

I am intelligent, caring, sweet and respectful person with decent morals and good sense of humor. I am interested in things beyond our immediate surroundings yet appreciate simple things. I like to go out or stay in and relax, travel, go somewhere new to learn, be by the ocean, sea or lake, music, food, art, history, science, nature... It would be nice to be with somebody special doing anything or nothing at all and just enjoy each other's company. I'm always open to meet new people . Ultimately, I hope to find true love: I want a man who will love me and be together always and forever. Someone who has a good heart, intelligent, kind, honest, loyal, confident and calm. With wide horizons, some similar interests and same morals. 

I'm a very open-minded, caring, and a ""Compassionate"" individual with a good personality. Communication to me is extremely important, if you don't have it between one another you really don't have much at all. I'm a good listener and I'm very romantic if the chemistry is there. I wake up with a positive attitude to start the day... Things just seem to flow in a good direction and I LOVE IT. Let me reinstate that, ITS GREAT! Life is too short to focus on the little negatives. So you will find I can be quite complimentary. 
I like a man who is gentle, adventurous, bold, and creative. He takes care of himself and it shows, he knows what he wants and he ""Goes for it"". he's not afraid to show real feelings.

Last summer I posted a Craig's List ad seeking a ballroom dance partner & I was so overwhelmed by the number of responses I received, I simply chickened out - which is a shame, because I received some very nice notes from respondents. I guess you could say that online dating/dancing isn't really my thing. 

I've been taking ballroom dance lessons for about a year and really enjoy them. I'd like to continue them with a committed dance partner, so we can go out to Vincents for Disco & Latin night (I hear it's great!) or perhaps go swing dancing in Boston. 

I am in my 50's, and am 5'6"" with a few pounds to lose - but can still hold my own on the dance floor. My ideal partner would be a non-smoking single guy on the South Shore who is also in his 50's, 5'8"" or taller, loves to dance & has a good sense of humor.

Tell me a little about yourself. Include a photo (and I'll share mine). We could start with coffee, then if all goes well, broach the subject of dance lessons. From there, who knows - in a perfect world we'll hit it off & become the next Fred and Ginger. But I think I'm getting ahead of myself here. 

Dance lessons are held in Weymouth once a week & are $50/pp per lesson. After 10-12 lessons, we'll be ready to hit the dance floor together. 

What else would you like to know about me?
-I live to travel. Belize is my winter destination of choice & once I'm in that water, it's hard to get me out. 
-I have a lovable lug of a beagle that was probably deprived of too much oxygen at birth
-Great sense of humor - I tend to see the absurdity in everything, including writing this ad
-I love live music of all kinds - blues, disco, funk, jazz, opera, you name it
-Not religious; recovering Catholic
-Bleeding heart liberal 
-Not a smoker or heavy drinker/drug user (although weed is fine by me)
-Struggling beginner guitar player
-Online dating is really out of my comfort zone

I am in need of serious discipline. I need a REAL man, not a boy, to keep me in my place. I have been in prior relationships where I was held accountable for my behavior--whether good or bad. And when I misbehaved, I was pulled over his lap, he would pull down my panties and give me spankings which sometimes I didn't think I would survive. Yet, these spankings taught me to be a good girl. Currently, I am falling right back into bad behavior and I need a man, between 35 and 45 to give me spankings. In the beginning, it is likely I will need a spanking everytime I see you. I prefer to be over your knee because it is a very humbling experience and also, you shouldn't need any implements. A real man just needs his big hands to spank me...if interested, let me know.

My perfect man is perfectly imperfect. He will be a type A personality who is a bit of a risk taker, he may screw up, but he keeps on trying and when he succeeds, he succeeds big. Until then, he lives life to the fullest, and if I am lucky enough he will let me join him. He will sail the oceans, ride the open road, fly the skies, make love with passion and laugh with zest. 
Nowhere is dull as long as he is with me. He makes me feel alive, beautiful and proud. He is the most dashing of dashing in my eyes, some will hate him, others adore him, he breaks hearts but doesn't mean to. He has no idea much he is loved, or how painful it is when he betrays, but he will be mine, if only for a little while.

I CHOOSE NOT TO POST IN OHIO BEING THAT MY FOCUS IS RELOCATING TO FLORIDA. I'M SEEKING ONLY SERIOUS RESPONSES WITH A PIC. I WON'T RESPOND TO ANYONE SENDING A PIC OF THEIR GENITALIA....I'LL DELETE IT. Please write a couple of lines of introduction....one liner e-mails will be deleted. AGAIN, THIS IS A SERIOUS AD. I'd like to connect with someone in Florida.....hopefully to build a LTR. If This Ad Piques Your Interest, Take a Chance And Contact me. YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.

This is a unique aspiration , I'm sure . I would like to find a connection with an experienced Master who also follows a spirtual path of Yoga as I see this dynamic from a spiritual perspective . 

Particularly in reference to power exchange and the lessening of the ego , a real reciprocal gifting . Taking one another to higher spiritual planes through the practice of different techniques, subspace is just one example.

I am not seeking a relationship . I would really like to find an amazing human being with whom I can share trust and transparency and be completely naked before in the spiritual sense. No judgement , just pure bliss ,

Those who have become a Dom or Master since reading 50 shades , please do not respond . I have been in this lifestyle far longer than that and it's much more than sexual, the sexual is just a beautiful by - product of something much deeper. 

I'm setting my intentions to reach that wonderful human being that may read this.

I'm no queen,hence need no king(nor a slave).I'm not feminist,and you shouldn't be a misogynist.

Was born and raised in a political dynasty with strict family eduction,but definitely a mutineer.I grew up with a strong sense of justice and compassion.No tattoo,don't smoke,socially drink.Rational,precise,very good at numbers.Spontanenous but rarely go emotional.Read a lot,but not a book worm.Fond of all schools of art particularly that of the 18th and 19th centuries.

Clean,tidy,caring,fashionable,adventurous,post-modern spirit,active and innovative,well-organized,home-oriented,hard-working,excellent cook.Not a perfectionist,just being a real self.Animal lover although i'm allergic to all furry creatures(In addition to hairy men).Amateur F1 car racer,golf player.

Objectively speaking,i'm pretty good looking.Thin,but not skinny.5'8'' tall,51kg,healthy,single,no kids,achieved a model qualification after University graduation,and been an airline stewardess for a while.

I'm a forseer.Ambitious,self-driven independent business woman,looking for a mature,stable,honest guy with consistency and single-minded in love for long term relationship which could lead to marriage.You need to have a regular job,and financially secure.My ideal man should be good looking,smart,healthy both physically and mentally.Age:24-46.Single or divorced without kids.Disease/drama/EX gfs/wives FREE.Feel free to ask anything further,i will answer with complete honesty.

Please note that i'm here looking for a future husband only,not a sugar boy or dating partner.

I don't need slick praise or candlelight hymn,but a man who can fix a sofa leg when it's broken,or can cook for himself when i'm away.

Generally,a man who can solve problems and build a future together with me,not a romanticist or a theoretician.

I would rather spend most of the time with you on talking about economy and politics than clothes and perfume.

When i see problems occur,i go to solve them.Meaningless nonsense and complain doesn't make sense to me.

Patient but can't tolerate nagging people(Sticky is fine).

I'm a 3 heads and 6 legs competent woman and won't accept a man who can't match/challenge me both mentally and intellectually.

Scammers and snobbish/materialistic dudes should knock off.And if you never have the time to care about other people's feelings and needs,my suggestion is you should marry yourself.

If you're a typical selfish/egoistic/self-centered ignorant person,or looking for someone to take care of you financially/invest you personally you're just becoming a day dreamer.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

PS:I require a Skype video chat after several emails/photos exchanging,when it's time to check whether the one writing to me is true(vice versa for you).And if you fail to show up on cam,i'll stop replying and delete you.Too busy for perpetual text messages or email texting and all kinds of time wasters.

Please write your first e-mail in the self-introduction form.No picture no reply.

I'm white & I am active and seek someone similar. With that said, non-smokers is a MUST! No druggies! No Alcoholics! No ebony men please.

Hello CL,

I'm a single mom looking for a friend to hang out with, that has the potential to become more later on. 

First, let me tell you a little bit more about myself:

• I'm 22, but I've been told I'm very mature for my age. Unfortunately, I'm still undecided when it comes to knowing what I want out of a relationship. I DO know that I'm NOT looking for a fwb, a hook up, or anything that involves meaningless sex.
• I've only been in a couple relationships (serious or otherwise), due to the simple reason that I haven't been looking. 
• I'm not fat, but I'm not skinny either. I'm more pudgy than anything. There are times I diet and times I don't. Same thing with exercise. I don't consider myself ugly or beautiful. You can judge for yourself. (Pic4pic)
• I enjoy reading and writing original stories. I'm hoping to attend college soon so I can major in English and maybe get a degree in child care too.
• I sometimes watch popular tv shows (Doctor Who, Once Upon A Time, Criminal Minds, etc), as well as anime (Naruto, Attack on Titan, etc). Occasionally, I'll play video games too (Legend of Zelda, Kingdom Hearts, Mortal Combat, etc). Keyword: sometimes.

Now let me give you a list of preferences (because we all have them). I'm looking for someone:

• Between the ages of 22-29.
• Who has their own car and a job. (I do not have a place of my own because I'm helping my recently divorced mom take care of my younger siblings. So it'd be really nice if you had your own place so that we could have the option of hanging out somewhere private.)
• Mature, respectful, and patient. (No jerks please.)
• Not obese. (I'm not particularly picky, but I have my limits.)
• Light complected (not racist; just a preference.)
• Who is okay with me being a mom first. I have a 3 year old son that comes before everything else in my life. Even if we were to start a serious relationship, my son would always be first.

I think I've finished ranting. If you're interested, e-mail me a current picture and more about yourself. Don't be discouraged if I don't reply right away. My working and sleeping schedule can be a bit chaotic since I work the graveyard shift sometimes.

Please put your name and age as the subject line.

My perfect man is perfectly imperfect. He will be a type A personality who is a bit of a risk taker, he may screw up, but he keeps on trying and when he succeeds, he succeeds big. Until then, he lives life to the fullest, and if I am lucky enough he will take me with him. He will sail the oceans, ride the open road, fly the skies, make love with passion and laugh with zest. 
Nowhere is dull as long as he is with me. He makes me feel alive, beautiful and proud. We enjoy fine dining and finding small dives. We love a nice glass of red wine or martinis with friends. We eat healthy because we care about our bodies when we are staying in, I cook, we cuddle and enjoy each others company. When apart, we cant wait to see each other. He has a slender or athletic body and stands over 5'8. He is the most dashing of dashing in my eyes, some will hate him, others adore him, he breaks hearts but doesn't mean to. He has no idea much he is loved, or how painful it is when he betrays, but he will be mine, if only for a little while. 
I have many male friends (no not with benefits), I am a good catch, but tough fit. I am hoping to fall in love again.
I know POF is a long shot, but I remain hopeful. PS a sense of self pride is a must, good hygiene as well as clothing variety.

If you think you like me, let me know. I'm worth it. I am educated, openly affectionate, well traveled, versed, and fun,
I am petite (5' 112 lbs), brunette, playful, non smoker, light drinker, no drugs, healthy, and ready for new adventures with my love. a bit edgy, flirty and ready to meet the man of my dreams, is it you?

I'm a simple yet complex woman:
Hopeful romantic, yet very realistic that finding an honest gentleman here is nearly impossible. However, I know that miracles do exist. Low maintenance when it comes to material things; yet high maintenance when it comes to attention and affection. Mature, yet an 'I don't wanna grow up', young at heart being. God loving Christian, yet human and not an Angel. Reserved, yet open minded and free spirited.

Looking for a man who is looking for a real relationship (LIKE ME) and knows how to treat a woman like a lady. A man of good character and values, who is stable (emotionally and financially) please. A man of Christian faith. A marriage minded man who is truly attracted to a full-figured, heavy set, BBW. A man who does not mind that I smoke cigs (though I plan to quit). A man who does not drink to get drunk or heavily. A man that has self control and is not looking to jump into my panties -- ain't gonna happen. Don't waste your time or mine if you are looking for sex, FWB, NSA, sexting, online romance, or money!!!

You must: be over 40, over 5'8"" in height, live in Central, North, Northwest, or Northeast Broward County; or West Boca, West Delray Beach. Include a photo with your message if you chose to contact me.

I would respectfully request that should you choose to consider contacting me, please refrain from sending photos of your penis...it's not a turn on, and besides it shows you have no respect for yourself or me. If you're interested to know more then please respond with a message that tells me something about you and include a rent clear photo -- you see most of me (will include a facial photo when I reply).

P.S we can start as friends and see where it leads ( cool👍)

Scammers and snobbish/materialistic dudes should knock off.And if you never have the time to care about other people's feelings and needs,my suggestion is you should marry yourself.

If you're a typical selfish/egoistic/self-centered ignorant person,or looking for someone to take care of you financially/invest you personally you're just becoming a day dreamer.

Hello CL,

I'm a single mom looking for a friend to hang out with, that has the potential to become more later on. 

First, let me tell you a little bit more about myself:

• I'm 22, but I've been told I'm very mature for my age. Unfortunately, I'm still undecided when it comes to knowing what I want out of a relationship. I DO know that I'm NOT looking for a fwb, a hook up, or anything that involves meaningless sex.
• I've only been in a couple relationships (serious or otherwise), due to the simple reason that I haven't been looking. 
• I'm not fat, but I'm not skinny either. I'm more pudgy than anything. There are times I diet and times I don't. Same thing with exercise. I don't consider myself ugly or beautiful. You can judge for yourself. (Pic4pic)
• I enjoy reading and writing original stories. I'm hoping to attend college soon so I can major in English and maybe get a degree in child care too.
• I sometimes watch popular tv shows (Doctor Who, Once Upon A Time, Criminal Minds, etc), as well as anime (Naruto, Attack on Titan, etc). Occasionally, I'll play video games too (Legend of Zelda, Kingdom Hearts, Mortal Combat, etc). Keyword: sometimes.

Now let me give you a list of preferences (because we all have them). I'm looking for someone:

• Between the ages of 22-29.
• Who has their own car and a job. (I do not have a place of my own because I'm helping my recently divorced mom take care of my younger siblings. So it'd be really nice if you had your own place so that we could have the option of hanging out somewhere private.)
• Mature, respectful, and patient. (No jerks please.)
• Not obese. (I'm not particularly picky, but I have my limits.)
• Light complected (not racist; just a preference.)
• Who is okay with me being a mom first. I have a 3 year old son that comes before everything else in my life. Even if we were to start a serious relationship, my son would always be first.

I think I've finished ranting. If you're interested, e-mail me a current picture and more about yourself. Don't be discouraged if I don't reply right away. My working and sleeping schedule can be a bit chaotic since I work the graveyard shift sometimes.

Please put your name and age as the subject line.

I am in need of serious discipline. I need a REAL man, not a boy, to keep me in my place. I have been in prior relationships where I was held accountable for my behavior--whether good or bad. And when I misbehaved, I was pulled over his lap, he would pull down my panties and give me spankings which sometimes I didn't think I would survive. Yet, these spankings taught me to be a good girl. Currently, I am falling right back into bad behavior and I need a man, between 35 and 45 to give me spankings. In the beginning, it is likely I will need a spanking everytime I see you. I prefer to be over your knee because it is a very humbling experience and also, you shouldn't need any implements. A real man just needs his big hands to spank me...if interested, let me know.

That you wait anxiously for me to take you from of your normal stressful life, to a world of two simple replies: ""YES MISTRESS"" & ""THANK YOU MISTRESS"".

You desperately need me to exert my will over your body. 
• Tying you up and sitting on your face
• Pegging you repeatedly with various toys
• Making you rub my feet, paint my nails and massage my body
• Slapping you, biting you and pulling your hair
• Putting you in panties and watching you clean 
• Using my toys to teach you patience and endurance 
• Teasing you to test your sexual control 

And when I do these things, I will see adoration in your eyes because you love being owned by your mistress. You will worship me and remain chaste even knowing that I will never be faithful and on occasion may force you to watch and serve. 
If this is you then tell me why I should waste my precious session time on a worthless little bitch like you. And If I like what you have to say I might make your fantasy come true.

Rules for your reply:

OK i have been receiving a lot of emails and i cant keep up so i will try again with a more in-depth post on here as well as a brief description on the basic traits of what I'm looking for in a man.

I am a single mommy of 2 kids. I am a very passionate woman and very old school in my ways. I take pride in doing house work and providing a comfortable living for my children. I am very blunt and will not hold back which is my worst trait. I am also the type of woman that will protect a stranger without thinking about my own safety also my worst trait since it has gotten me injured more than once.. I am the kind of woman that will protect my family and treat my boyfriend/husband with care and respect. I may be short but i can handle myself and to be frank i am sick of being the Protector. 

I want a man that has respect for himself and others around him. one that has a strong will to try and not give up. I want a man that is willing to play a video game and doesn't get but hurt if i am one level or more higher in a game of any type. i want a man that will listen to my advice with trust even if its something about car problems.. every chick wants an honest and loyal man but to be straight with you most of them cannot handle those men but i can! 

In your reply type Blue 2 in the subject and tell me a little about yourself.

When responding please include a recent photo and something about yourself. I will respond if I see a possible match. 
My perfect man is perfectly imperfect. He will be Caucasian, over 55 and under 67. He will be a type A personality who is a bit of a risk taker, he may screw up, but he keeps on trying and when he succeeds, he succeeds big. Until then, he lives life to the fullest, and if I am lucky enough he will take me with him. He will sail the oceans, ride the open road, fly the skies, make love with passion and laugh with zest. 
Nowhere is dull as long as he is with me. He makes me feel alive, beautiful and proud. We enjoy fine dining and finding small dives. He doesn't smoke. We love a nice glass of red wine or martinis with friends. We eat healthy because we care about our bodies when we are staying in, I cook, we cuddle and enjoy each others company. He is well written and well versed. When apart, we cant wait to see each other. He has a slender or athletic body and stands over 5'8. He is the most dashing of dashing in my eyes, some will hate him, others adore him, he breaks hearts but doesn't mean to. He has no idea much he is loved, or how painful it is when he betrays, but he will be mine, if only for a little while. 
I have many male friends (no not with benefits), I am a good catch, but tough fit. I am hoping to fall in love again.
I know POF is a long shot, but I remain hopeful. PS a sense of self pride is a must, good hygiene as well as clothing variety.

If you think you like me, let me know. I'm worth it. I am educated, openly affectionate, well traveled, versed, and fun,
I am petite (5' 112 lbs), Caucasian, brunette, playful, non smoker, light drinker, no drugs, healthy, and ready for new adventures with my love. a bit edgy, flirty and ready to meet the man of my dreams, is it you?

I'm no queen,hence need no king(nor a slave).I'm not feminist,and you shouldn't be a misogynist.

Was born and raised in a political dynasty with strict family eduction,but definitely a mutineer.I grew up with a strong sense of justice and compassion.No tattoo,don't smoke,socially drink.Rational,precise,very good at numbers.Spontanenous but rarely go emotional.Read a lot,but not a book worm.Fond of all schools of art particularly that of the 18th and 19th centuries.

Clean,tidy,caring,fashionable,adventurous,post-modern spirit,active and innovative,well-organized,home-oriented,hard-working,excellent cook.Not a perfectionist,just being a real self.Animal lover although i'm allergic to all furry creatures(In addition to hairy men).Amateur F1 car racer,golf player.

Objectively speaking,i'm pretty good looking.Thin,but not skinny.5'8'' tall,51kg,healthy,single,no kids,achieved a model qualification after University graduation,and been an airline stewardess for a while.

I'm a forseer.Ambitious,self-driven independent business woman,looking for a mature,stable,honest guy with consistency and single-minded in love for long term relationship which could lead to marriage.You need to have a regular job,and financially secure.My ideal man should be good looking,smart,healthy both physically and mentally.Age:24-46.Single or divorced without kids.Disease/drama/EX gfs/wives FREE.Feel free to ask anything further,i will answer with complete honesty.

Please note that i'm here looking for a future husband only,not a sugar boy or dating partner.

I don't need slick praise or candlelight hymn,but a man who can fix a sofa leg when it's broken,or can cook for himself when i'm away.

Generally,a man who can solve problems and build a future together with me,not a romanticist or a theoretician.

I would rather spend most of the time with you on talking about economy and politics than clothes and perfume.

When i see problems occur,i go to solve them.Meaningless nonsense and complain doesn't make sense to me.

Patient but can't tolerate nagging people(Sticky is fine).

I'm a 3 heads and 6 legs competent woman and won't accept a man who can't match/challenge me both mentally and intellectually.

Scammers and snobbish/materialistic dudes should knock off.And if you never have the time to care about other people's feelings and needs,my suggestion is you should marry yourself.

If you're a typical selfish/egoistic/self-centered ignorant American,or looking for someone to take care of you financially/invest you personally you're just becoming a day dreamer.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

PS:I require a Skype video chat after several emails/photos exchanging,when it's time to check whether the one writing to me is true(vice versa for you).And if you fail to show up on cam,i'll stop replying and delete you.Too busy for perpetual text messages or email texting and all kinds of time wasters.

Please write your first e-mail in the self-introduction form.No picture no reply.

VIRGOS don't bother,no preaching,no brainwash,go scheme and USE others as you won't GAIN anything from me.Flag me down once for all,and if you are incapable of doing so,you'll see my post on the top each day.😂

So let me apologize for not getting here sooner but everything happens in its own time. I had some personal things to settle in my life to ensure our happiness. By now, you have learned to laugh a little more and smile a little brighter as have I. 

I'm now in my early 40's. I'm a SBF who is intelligent, classy, elegant and intelligent. I am somewhat timid but am blunt and candid which you will appreciate. I'm very outgoing and carry myself and conversations better than ever. I come from a varied (and large) Caribbean background and have been blessed with curves in ALL the right places. I've learned to cook outside my cultural norm and have become quite impressed with this feat. I work part time and am finishing up a RN program in June. 

I ran track and field all thru to high school so I keep myself fit and healthy and expect the same of you. I am learning Yoga and would also like to take tennis lessons. I love walking in my favorite 2 parks. I like watching sunrises from the beach and walks on the beach. I want to get back into casual bike riding (I don't own a bike now but I don't mind investing). I absolutely love the carnivals/fairs in Florida. I like working out and hanging out (time permitting). I also do a lot of volunteering activities. I enjoy the movies, occasional dinner dates, going to the mall and traveling (I've never been to the Keys or on a cruise *hint hint*). I don't mind staying home and watching movies but I refuse to be your couch potato buddy. I'm open minded and will try most anything once. 

Someone in the medical field would be ideal but not a deal breaker. DDF and non-smoker is an absolute must. You must be single, professional, spiritual, respectful, sensual, passionate, independent and secure. No baby mama drama will be permitted. 

I'm definitely more attracted to Middle Eastern/Mediterranean men but also not a deal breaker. I have an affinity for neatly trimmed, well kept facial hair and nice, straight natural teeth. You have to be healthy with GREAT hygiene and respect working out. 

Respond kindly by email and attach a pic if you expect a response. I you think we have similar interests, tell me about you and yours. Msgs with pics of private parts will immediately be deleted. We will do a casual ""meet and greet"" in a public place first and take it from there.

I need someone to bring me out of that first and foremost. Let's rent a yacht, travel, eat good, just have the time of our lives. I'm not looking to dig in your pockets, I can pay for myself if needed. I have no children or husband so I have a lot of free time outside of work. I just need the Miami experience.

I am a 28 year old bbw. I am 5'5"", blond medium length hair and green eyes. I am separated and in the beginning stages of my divorce. We have been separated for almost two years now and live in completely different states so there is no drama thankfully. I do not drive as of right now or work due to seizures. I am on disability and live with family temporarily. 

If you made it this far that means you are willing to give me a chance and don't judge a woman by her flaws. What I don't want is a man that messages me and within the first week or two wants naked pictures and wants to talk about sex. If this is what you want then please move on. 

I am a country girl, I have a big heart, I am dedicated, determined, lovable, have a sense of humor and I am caring. I obviously listen to country music along with classic rock, rock, and pop. I like horror, action, and comedy movies. I don't watch much tv but when I do it's either impractical jokers or chicago fire. I am a sports fanatic. My teams are Pittsburgh Steelers and Boston Red Sox. Other interests of mine include but are not limited to; car shows, festivals, fundraising bingos and basket auctions, festivals/fairs, craft shows, flea markets, mini golf and bowling. 

If you want toget to know me better please feel free to email me. I have kik as well (pottstown)

I'm a BBW that misses having a significant partner in my life. I miss kissing passionately, hugging, cuddling, texting just to say hi, talking about everything, talking about nothing, laughing --- in other words I miss having a boyfriend! 

I'm still hoping to find a man that wants a real relationship, and lives in reality not fantasy! I'm looking for someone I can build a LTR with. NOT a friend with benefits! Not a hook-up! I am looking to meet a man with whom I could develop a true romantic monogamous relationship. Please truly want a real relationship and HAVE THE TIME needed to invest in actually getting together, dating, talking and developing a relationship. Keep meeting men who say they're interested, but then have no time to do anything and barely talk! Communication and spending time together is the only way to really get to know someone!!!

I'm a Christian (not holier than thou - not an Angel, but love God), and want a man who also has a deep faith in the Lord. I'm down to earth, have good common sense, enjoy different activities (tell you later), am very young at heart, like animals and most people. I'm friendly, kind, and loyal. I expect to be treated like a lady!

I'm pretty, fair skinned, and very affectionate. I do smoke cigarettes. I rarely drink. DO NOT DO DRUGS OR HANG WITH ANYONE THAT DOES. Am not into club scene, or bar hopping. 

If you are a man who is genuinely seeking an actual relationship with a good woman send me a message and let's meet! You should be a Christian, at least 5'8"" or taller, single, and very REAL. Prefer you live nearby (Central/North Broward) or be willing to do most the driving! You must be age appropriate! At least 40 years of age!

PLEASE SEND A REPLY WITH YOUR CURRENT PHOTOS,YOUR STATS, WHAT YOUR LOOKING FOR. I gave details about me, so please tell me little about you! NO ONE LINERS PLEASE. WHEN I REPLY I WILL SENT MORE THAN ONE PHOTO -- if you send your pic first! PLEASE NO NUDE PHOTOS -- YOUR EMAIL WILL BE DELETED!

MAY YOU FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR!

I am many things but have never been a friend to a man. I see men in a more interesting way. As long as you are active, know how to arrange a date, and U N M A R R I E D, contact me. 

I like a man who dresses well, has great social skills, some fun, reads something, likes culture. I like to visit NYC to see a play or musical then visit a museum or two. If the thought of these things makes your skin crawl, do not bother. 

I have a normal life and an annoying thing called a job. 
Mid-40s to mid-50s.
Please, no photo. I want a decent message- not ""Hi.""
