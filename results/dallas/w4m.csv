Hey! 
So how should I start off? Well, first off I am very dominate and have a bad attitude. I am Hispanic and young. I like treating my male counter part badly and being spoiled. Basically, if you like being humiliated and worship one women let me know. 



By the way, that is me in my picture

Where to begin?

I like a good concert at Verizon or Bass Hall.
My favorite color is purple with pink a close second.
I'm the kind of person who uses a paper towel on my hand to open public bathroom doors.
Appreciate a good roll in the hay that lasts at least two hours minimum once a week.

Love to cook up a meal at home .. preferably at your place.
Enjoy a nice walk along the trails when its not too hot.
Fairly conservative in public but mildly uninhibited behind closed doors.
Love to lick on my boyfriend and then ride him for at least an hour.

Buy my gas at Shell because the yellow and red color scheme appeals to me.
A careful driver and try not to text in the car except maybe at stoplights but 
even then I keep an eye on it and don't miss the light when it turns green.
I consider sex to be a healthy normal activity and try to practice as much as possible.

Used to sew a lot but don't have the time for it anymore.
Like to garden and play in the dirt.
Enjoy talking on the phone late at night with a boyfriend to put me to sleep.
Cowgirl is my favorite followed by missionary legs up and of course, doggie.

So .. what about you?

If you are single, white, local, no taller than 6' and no shorter than 7"", drop me a line...

:)

Hi there, first off I am not a regular on Craigslist, but I am obviously looking in the wrong places for my ""Mr. Right"".
I am 23 years old, I work fulltime, my family is very important to me, and I am a Bigger Girl.
I do have goals in life, as we all should. I love baseball, and I am a die-hard CARDS fan. I do occasionally drink. I will make the most out of any situation.?
I am exhausted from meeting all the wrong men and tired of looking for the right ones. This will be my last shot before I honestly give up on love.?

What I am looking for:

Someone who has a great personality and sense of humor. I'm all about the laughter.?
Someone who has a job, because I have a hard enough time taking care of myself financially, I don't need that.
And we'll go from there.
Send a picture of yourself with your first reply.

Please, send me an E-mail.--> Put something witty in the subject line so I can get rid of the spam.
Thank you so much for your time. ??

Finding Love is like finding a New Job. There is an interview process and that determines whether or not if you want to move forward with them. Its hard sometimes to find that one person who will love you for who you are. Sometimes it feels like were playing Powerball and just praying that we get the numbers correct. Sometimes waiting around for Mr. Right to show up does not happen and years go by. So taking a chance and praying that I can meet a nice man is wishful.
For me I am a single mom to two kids. My kids mean the world to me. They do come first in my life. I am looking for a man that can I understand that. Family time is important. I also work full-time and enjoy my job. Im also a photographer on the side. I am ""Awake"" .In my free time I like going to the movies, karaoke, and going to the park. I also like to take road trips.
I am looking for a man who is understanding and caring. Traditional and a Hopeless Romantic. I am looking for a man who wants a relationship with possible marriage. Laughter, Good Communicator and Listener.
I do work full-time Monday - Friday and I will get back with you as soon as I can. I am looking for true love.
Please send me a Bio and a Picture. I will respond with a picture as well. I am a nice person with a good heart.

Welcome to my posting.. This may not be the best place to find a good man, but you never know, so here I try.....
I am a pretty, smart, sweet, petite in size, woman in search of the right man for me. I was born and raised in a rural area in Wisconsin and is where I still currently live. I am willing to consider relocating for love, (or you here) so distance could be just a temporary dilemma. I am fun, but yet I have good morals, and try to be kind to others. I am a hard worker, good cook, and keep a clean cozy home. I take good care of myself, and I am told I look much younger. I enjoy nature, animals, bonfires, fishing, (ice fishing) hunting, cooking, cuddling, cleaning, trucks, and Country and Christian music. I have the right stuff to offer, and I am an all around great catch. I have 2 grown kids, and now its time for me!
You should be first and for most a gentleman. You should be above 45 years old. You should have a good head on your shoulders, and have your life together. You can be ""clean cut"" or a ""bad boy"" I do not have a certain ""type"". I will know you are the one when that time comes. If interested please send a nice email explaining yourself, what you are looking for, and a photo we can exchange.

Hi all, 
Good evening! 

I am an Asian with 2 kids. I have been single over 2 years and been a widow over 5 years. I think I am ready to get back to the dating scenes. First of all, I need to tell you that I am not a skinny girl. I am a woman with some extra fat. Ah well, I used to be fit and I am going to start to lose weights. Second, I am not looking for a hook up or NSA. I am truly to find a good friend that we can go on more- a relationship. 

Here are some information of me. I am college graduated. I have my own things in order. I have stuffs what I need and want. I am NOT a gold digger that just looking for a place to live, blah blah blah. At the same time, I am not looking a gold digger too. I hope you have your own things on your shoulders too. This is very important. A man who can meet these conditions tells a lot how you treats your life already. 

And ideally, hope you are between 30-45. I know age is just a number. But sometimes age is important for some points too. 

Please include a pic with you and put your name and favorite sport team in subject. Then I will reply. Thanks for reading. Have a great one.

I am a SWF, 5'6, busty/curvy (size 12/14). I'm also an attractive woman who has confidence in herself and knows what she wants. For those of you who don't appreciate a gorgeous woman inside and out but put everything in perspective about a size, shape or weight then you know what you're attracted to and I'm not trying to convince you otherwise. We all have a ""type"" and physical attraction and intimacy is required in a long term fulfilling relationship. As to what I am looking for...a SWM, in his late 30's to early 40's, that lives in the north Texas area who wants to talk, date and ultimately have a relationship with. Just like everyone else I know what I'm attracted to, I like men who are taller than me. But more importantly I like a man who knows how to take charge, who has a great sense of humor and who's charm is effortless and endearing. Attraction is important, we all know this. Please respond and tell me about yourself, send a recent picture and we'll go from there. Thanks.

I'm so tired of being a good woman only to deal with men who only want to play games! Tired of being lonely at night! Tired of not having anyone to share my life with!

Lover.... and King!! 

I'm not looking for perfection or prince charming. I just want a man who knows how to be a man a treat a lady! Whose not into games, lies or deception.

Hey guys!! I'm kinda just writing this because I feel like my social life has hit a plateau. I don't feel like I'm meeting worth while guys when I go out (If that makes sense). Things just always kind of fizzle out before anything starts.So I thought I'd try CL for some texting buddies to see where things go...

Annnywaayss enough about that! I'm 22 and a full time student. I love music, CONCERTS, reading, movies and hanging out with fun people. I like to think that that I'm bubbly, energetic, and pretty fluent in sarcasm. I have a big family and they're my world. :D

That's me in an incredibly boring nutshell and if you've made it this far I guess you're wondering what I'm looking for in you. I think really I'm just looking for a man that knows how to hold a conversation, who's witty and a great sense of humor wouldn't hurt either.;) I'm really looking for someone 22-32 ish years old.

I'm definitely not looking for sex, so if that's what you're looking for, I apologize you've read this far. I'm really awkwardly bad at these kinds of things, but I hope I made a good first impression on someone! I'm just gonna leave this here because I have no idea what else to say lol

P.S. Put your favorite band as the header to rule out bots...Please! :)

Hi, there. I'm looking for something a little different, maybe. First of all, let me say that I am in a relationship and have been for a few months with a man who I also live with. He's a good man. That being said, I'm pretty sure he isn't the man for me but I'm going to stay with him unless you just happen to be my soul mate. The reason he isn't the man for me is because he's simple. I'm quite the opposite of simple, although a lot of times I wish I could just be as simple as most. I'm a deep thinker, who has a touch of social anxiety and a deep yearning for this fairy tale love, or intimacy if you will, that I picture in my head. This man I'm with barely touches me and maybe wants to make love to me once a week if I'm lucky. I need more than that. I want to feel wanted and be touched everywhere, constantly, in any way. I want to be looked at like I'm the best thing in the world. I want to sexually be taken and feel owned by a strong, bull headed, man who can't seem to get enough of me. I want to be made love to and fucked at the same time, by someone I have a connection with on a soul mate type level. If you think you can be this man for me, you'll have to be willing to come pick me up at a late, discreet hour, whenever we get the hunger for each other, and bring me back before day light. If we get that far, we can start figuring out other ways to see each other. You're also under the age of 40 and above the age of 23. I'd love to connect with another deep thinker. Someone who has a need to stay up late and talk about nothing and everything. I'd prefer you be 420 friendly. I consider myself shy at first, but funny, odd and quick witted once I'm warmed up to someone. My hobbies include, fishing, riding motorcycles, learning, listening, music and long walks through cemeteries. Serious inquiries only please. No pic gets you no reply. Intrigue me with your words. I'm waiting.

First off let me say that I don't need a man. I want to share my life with a man. I am not just looking for sex, so if that is all you are looking for, keep looking. I am an honest, independent and open-minded woman. I have my life together, so you should also. I am looking for someone to grow old with. I do not want to get married or have kids, however, if you have kids that is okay. 

I like to read, sing, dance, listen to music, watch movies/television, debate current event issues and cook.

If you are interested in anything I said above and are between the ages of 35-55 then I hope to hear from you. Please send me an e-mail telling me your age, location and what you are looking for. Tell me a little bit about yourself. Will trade pic for pic.

Im not looking for a sugar daddy or someone to take care of me although, I'm not interested in someone that lives in his mother's basement, you must have a job and a home of your own. It shows responsibility. If your my age and you're not responsible than you probably couldn't handle a responsible relationship. I am looking for my best friend and someone that wants to be their partners best friend in life, someone to laugh with, have fun with and eventually share a life together. I do have children so you must like kids and you must be ready for a future with a women. I'm only looking for someone that's ready to settle down. Honestly, I just want a damn good man. Is that to much to ask for? Lol .. If you will send a short bio of yourself and a picouple that would help get this convo started and Ifor I like what I read,you may even get my number. I'm not wanting to text and email forever, I would like to meet up and get to know eachother. Fyi, it was pouring down rain yesterday, so that you know I'm real.

Hi, 

I can't believe I am looking for a nice guy on Craigslist, but I find that real people read these things and I thought I would see if you were reading this today. 

I am told I am attractive, I am a Big Beautiful Woman( BBW ), I am a very active woman, busy with work, friends, grand kids, but I am willing to make the time to get to know you.and see if we have a connection. I really want to share my life with someone. Even though I am busy, I get lonely and I am tired of spending free time all by myself . 

So are you ""spontaneous"" ? How about coffee? Walk in the park, or walk on the beach, watch a movie, listen to some music, take a drive up the Central Coast, watch the sun set or star gaze? Of course not in one day. But I think you get what I am saying. =)

If I am a lady that you would like to meet, please feel free to contact me.

Please put in the subject line where your from and your age. (like Santa Maria 55), this way I will know you are real. I will not even look at any other emails. 

Again I am NOT looking for a one night stand, or if you are going through family drama I am not interested either, also one more thing I having nothing against different places,but I am not wanting a long distance relationship. If any of this is you then please move along and do not contact me. 

I look forward to talking to you soon. Have a wonderful day!

Wanting to spend time with someone who can eventually become a special friend. Would like to find someone who has similar likes but also are into their own thing. I like different, unique, easy going, classic rock but all kinds of music, all types of art, psychic stuff and rocks. Whether simply hanging out or doing a few things over the weekend and deciding the last minute is very cool as well. Must cook/grill because I really do not or let's say I need to take a few classes. Must be self sufficient as I do not want to take care of you financially if that makes sense. A big plus, you know how to play a guitar, teach playing a guitar, drink occasionally, have a great sense of humor, have a secure job, landscape, cook, not complain to much about life in general...nag...bitch, nor be married and just be overall happy. Also, someone in their 40s - 50s or 60s. Noticed the landscaping..hint..hint.

We ask how each others day is going. We talk/text during the day. We take up for each other. One gets hurt the other feels the pain. We take care of family. I have no children but will welcome yours into our home. We save for a raining day. We take vacations together. We have our time with our individual friends, but we stay loyal to each other. We only have eyes for each other. We never hurt each other on purpose. We strive to be each others best friend. In marriage, divorce is not an option. We work it out. We mow our yard. We pay our bills. We hug often and hold hands in the movies. We hold hands walking. We kiss and are intimate often. We work or jobs and come home to each other. We believe in chivalry. What would you like to add?

A little of my personality, a good heart (its been beat up a bit) no children. One spoilt dog. Home and car owner. Sweet, classy, intelligent, professional, strive to live a life of excellence. If you've ever listened to Joel Olsten you'll know what that means. Likes, drives to nowhere. dining out, movies, flea markets, craft fair, concerts in the park, boating, the Florida beach, travel, 

If you can see yourself in this life. If you have old fashioned values and know how to court a woman. I would love to hear from you. A picture is not needed at this time. Just a really good spark of interest that this is the life you desire also. I like men with meat on thier bones. I really like heavy guys.

Dear Love,
I wanted to write you a short note. Just to let you know I was thinking about you. I hope your having a great time, but I wanted to let you know that I'm missing you. Missing the way only you can make me laugh with your silliness. And the way you snuggle up with me to watch a little late night tv, because neither of us could sleep. I miss singing in the car with you, on one of our last minute road trips. I just miss everything about you. Even the things I dont like so much. I still miss them because its a part of you and who you are. 
But since I haven't heard from you, I was wondering if you missed me too? After the Walking Dead premier I didn't have anyone to talk with about it. The only person I thought about was you. I hope you saw it, because if you did it would be something we did at the same time. And that would make me feel a little better, knowing that we watched something together, kinda. I know I'm not perfect, but I honestly hope your happy and wish you all the best.
If your feeling lonely, you can always talk to me, I'm a good listener, remember. Ok, well bye. I hope to hear from you soon, but if not take care.

Always,
Me 💋 💘

I am relatively new to the area and haven't made many friends that I have a lot in common with since I have moved here. I love being outside, going fishing, going shooting, 4-wheeling, going to country music concerts, going to the lake, camping and most of all just hanging out with good people. I am very easy going and can basically have a good time no matter where I go or what I do. I guess I need to tell you that I am a bigger girl since it seems to be very important to most people on here. I don't necessarily see myself that way so it doesn't keep me from doing much of anything. I just need some new people to get out of the house with and get active again. If you are interested, attach a picture of yourself and tell me a little about yourself. I'm not interested in anyone who is married, NSA, or any druggies.

Hey I finish watching another romantic Nicholas Sparks movie, 'The Best of Me', I realize two things; 1) I'd rather watch 'Your Neighbor is a Paycho' or even 'AMillion Ways to Die'. 2) I should not trust Nicholas Sparks on a lonely Valentine Eve. 

I mean seriously, this guy really must be a woman. Right? Who comes up with these scripts. It can't be a man... Can it?!? Anyway, enough of that mans romantic ramblings..

I briefly read through the 'men for woman' ads and thought I'd vomit. G spots, spankings, stockings, feet fetishes, use my sperm to have a baby, I just want to smell your hair, etc, lots of creepy stuff, etc,... Seriously people, I can't even imagine what goes through your head at night. Eeeek!

Look. I'm a normal 41 (newly 41) year old woman who seeks to have intelligent conversation with a normal professional male. If you want all that above stuff, make sure you know your lady well, or she's gonna walk.... Hell, if she's smart, she's gonna run, and run fast! 

Im already skittish about this whole CL thing. So, don't scare a newby off. I'm looking for a SWM with a JOB, established. Sweet, honest, knows how to treat a lady. No criminal record. Let me reiterate the SINGLE part in case you missed it. 

A little background on myself. I'm a mother, a wife (I took that job seriously. However, he didnt and I'm not going to be the damsel in distress.) I'm not looking for a man to take care of me or my kids. I'm looking for
Someone who can share good common life goals, good morals, offer friendly advice, make me laugh till I cry. Someone who can smile when their having a bad day, and is cabable of still making me smile. Someone who helps that little old lady change her tire along side the road. Someone who can look at me first thing in the morning, all flaws ablaze and still, truthfully, tell me I'm beautiful. Someone who is not afraid to show their feelings and someone who is not juggling 4 girls to see who puts out first. 

If this sounds like you and your between the ages of 35-45. Try me. Give me great conversation and help me find balance.

I don't like laziness and am a hard worker myself. I can be laid back or the opposite. I enjoy good conversation, laughing, and stimulating verbal communication. I know it's not easy taking a chance - again, but I am worth it once I am hooked.

I have travelled a lot domestically and internationally.I believe in spiritual growth and commitment, while not being over the top. I consider myself to be very patriotic and still feel pride of country rise up in me, when I hear the national anthem.Moving forward in life is what matters to me, and is what really counts with me. Kissing is a passion.......I am passionate in so many aspects of my life, looking for my equal. Ultimate goal for everyone is to take a chance and connect with someone, whether it is for a short time or hopefully, on a long term basis. 

Seeking someone who wants to ""complement"" my life as I wish to do the same for them. Strong in their Christian faith as I, but do enjoy having fun. Would like to continue life's journey with my soul-mate experiencing the exciting journey that fate has in store for us, enjoying learning about each other and exploring old and new places together. Enjoy have fun as well as quiet times, it is about quality time with someone special.

Hi! 

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my ad! I guess I am just feeling really lonely lately and hoping to find someone that might want to connect and see what happens. Not into fwb or similar situations sorry, I want a relationship and a fun one at that! I like to have fun and try new things, love to travel (although don't get to as much as I would like), meet new people, etc. 

I am 5'7 (taller for a female), white, brown eyes and long brown hair. I like to get dolled up for an evening out but love to stay in and watch some good tv as well. I love learning and still strive to as often as possible, even if its just watching documentaries. I am overweight and a ""chunk"" as some would call it, trying to be healthier but I don't let it get me down and I hope it doesn't bother you either! 

I am very open to the guy I am looking for - hopefully has a job, car and place to stay. I am not into drugs and hope he isn't either. I tend to find people who are a little larger to be attractive to me, but I really am so open. I would prefer to find a lasting relationship so I would prefer someone who is closer to my age *27 years young* and happens to be white (but again open to everyone). 

I hope to meet you soon and start a great relationship, otherwise, I'll keep my head up and keep hoping that our paths will cross soon. 

Happy thursday everyone!

If you only knew how often you cross my mind, consuming my thoughts. I miss you even though I've never had you. Throughout my life I have been lucky enough to experience love and I have also learnt what it feels like to go without. The dull ache from loneliness courses through my body. The tears have spilt out of my eyes landing on my pillow because sometimes it's too much to take. I know exactly how much I have to give to you. Craving so desperately your gentle embrace, just tight enough that I won't slip away but light enough to give me the room I need to breath. Wanting to drink you in and escape into you. I often sit alone at my table eating the food I've prepared looking at your empty spot, wishing for your companionship. Those easy going conversations and comfortable silences. Have I had you, only for you to slip away? Are you searching for me right now? 
I've looked for you time and time again always coming up short. Where will we find each other? Online? Will we see each other somewhere and recognize a safe place in one another's eyes? Oh my sweet, dear friend, my lover come to me. Let my words awaken you. I wait for you as patiently as I can possibly bear.

Hello! First things first, I'm poly. If you don't know what that is or that notion offends you...this ad isn't for you. Also just to state up front, I'm not seeking a couple or to join a triad. 

I'm a 35 year old female searching for a guy who is looking for a casual dating relationship that has the ability to turn into something more on down the road. I do currently have a secondary partner that I'm very pleased with, but I'm searching for someone that, at some point, can fill a primary role in my life. 

So this is me. I'm looking for a guy in close proximity to the HEB area and under the age of 50 with little to no drama that has space in his life to hang out with a great casual woman.

I'm a kinky gal, searching for a kinky guy with an open mind. I am a feminine, hedonistic geek with a propensity for assertive and intelligent companions. And when I say geek, I mean I am nice broad spectrum type of geek. I watch the History Channel almost as often as I watch FOX (as in Bones not O'Reilly). I love the outdoors. I camp frequently and sometimes in less than ideal situations (and I enjoy it). I like Buffy and Firefly. In my spare time, I play video games. New gadgets make me weak in the knees. I enjoy traveling and do so frequently both with work and on my own. I read a great deal (and more than what some would consider to be healthy) with varied interests. I love small ""hole in the wall"" restaurants, ethnic foods, and interactive dining. I find geeks incredibly sexy no matter what flavor of geek they might be. Mainly because to be a geek means you are passionate about something, and passion is never a bad thing.

I am a curvy 5'4"" and 190 pounds. I am incredibly happy with my body, and you should be as well. I am a brunette with curly hair.

Hopefully all of this gives you a good understanding of just what it is I am looking for, and hopefully it is appealing to you as well. I strive to be open and honest so I welcome any questions anyone may have. Please respond with a photo and I will do the same. Thanks for reading.

Hi, 

I am a really sweet and caring girl just looking for my new best friend. I am envious of those couples that seem to really enjoy being with each other and hoping one day to find the same. I am a hopeless romantic - I listen to all the most romantic songs and imagine my prince charming coming to dance with me to them. 

Corny I know, but a girl can dream. I am have various interests, some of which actually coincide with mainstream ""masculine"" hobbies -- ie video gaming, watching the cowboys (they were rough without romo this year), hiking, etc. I love to try new things as well, and enjoy finding new people to do things with. 

I hate meeting people with expectations, just some great friends that possibly develops into more would be great. I mean it can take a little while for anyone to open up, and being rushed or forced never really works out anyway. 

I am 27 years old, white, brown eyes and hair, and overweight. Yes, its true. I have two cats that I adore and hope that you love animals as well. 

I am open to chatting and seeing where it goes from there, let me know of some interests and hobbies you enjoy. I hope to meet some nice people! Please be *somewhat* close to my age and drug free. Some ambition in life would be great too, just someone who knows what they want and how to get there.

My goal is to meet an older gentleman. He must be kind in all aspects. He must be willing to take a risk. Most importantly I'm looking for a gentleman who can treat me like a woman deserves to be treated.

Hello If you only knew how often you cross my mind, consuming my thoughts. I miss you even though I've never had you. Throughout my life I have been lucky enough to experience love and I have also learnt what it feels like to go without. The dull ache from loneliness courses through my body. The tears have spilt out of my eyes landing on my pillow because sometimes it's too much to take. I know exactly how much I have to give to you. 
Craving so desperately your gentle embrace, just tight enough that I won't slip away but light enough to give me the room I need to breath. Wanting to drink you in and escape into you. 
I often sit alone at my table eating the food I've prepared looking at your empty spot, wishing for your companionship. Those easy going conversations and comfortable silences. Have I had you, only for you to slip away? Are you searching for me right now? 
I've looked for you time and time again always coming up short. Where will we find each other? Online? Will we see each other somewhere and recognize a safe place in one another's eyes? Oh my sweet, dear friend, my lover come to me. Let my words awaken you. I wait for you as patiently as I can possibly bear.

I am looking for a long term relationship with a man who I feel passion, chemistry, a strong physical connection with.
I have only found 1 guy in my life who I felt this way for and I am desperately craving it again. It's hard to find. 
It's not like being with some average person you settle for or someone with just a nice body and gorgeous smile you find hot. 
Its an intense connection emotionally and physically. I do believe in ""love at first sight.""
Here's the catch: I am shy, insecure, inexperienced, a little overweight and dependent. 
I want a man to take care of me, to boost my self esteem and compliment me regularly. 
To tell me and show me he wants me and not stop after a few months into the relationship and expect me to ""just know."" 
I need a man to help show me its ok to be me, ok to open up and let loose and not hide. Someone patient with me being inexperienced, someone non-judgmental,
and someone who can motivate me to be better, to be who I want to be, to be who you want in a girl and to wow you.
A guy to work out with me and be active with to push me out of my comfort zone.
I can be fiesty and needy, and I need a real man who can handle it. 
This all seems like a lot, but I don't think its too much different than most relationship hurdles.
I can be a great lover/partner to the right person.I'd like a man who is strong, with good hygiene, has a stable income, a car, 
27-40yrs old, drug and disease free, taller than 5' 7"" and preferably doesnt smoke cigarettes.
If this describes you and you think you can give me what I need, hit me up and we'll talk more.
Please be honest and up front about what you're looking for and what you need, also be as detailed as possible about yourself. 
I am serious and dont want to waste too much time with pointless email tag. Must include a couple photos of yourself or no reply.
Thanks

1st let me say I'm a totally cool chic, college educated, have had some absolute amazing positions in my career that most only dream about. I've learned that a career isn't what makes a person special no matter what others tell you. 
I'm actually more humble and kind than I am arrogant and uncaring of others thoughts and feelings.

So here comes the difficult part and never in a million years did I ever think I'd be in a situation where I would be seeking something a bit unorthodox. 
Bare with me while I gather my thoughts and try to cautiously govern what I'm about to say...............
I'd like to meet an attractive man between the age of 29-37
You must be a Non Smoker
Have a solid job or career
Own your own vehicle
Be completely straight 
Fully believe in God (Christian) not atheist, agnostic or anything else that I might of forgotten to list, oh did I say and not into anything Satanic? Yikes
You Must be healthy and range from fit to average 
If you are Military affiliated that works for me since my background is Military. Military just seems to mesh better with other Military types.

If you like dogs that's cool since I'm thinking about getting one. 
I have a cool pad, my own vehicle and my own income. 
I'm average looking and I'm considered attractive average. I believe confidence and high self esteem go a long way and make a difference. 
I don't drink, do drugs and I'm 100% positive I am disease free so you be too.

I'm a chic that can clock anyone, female or male if need be. However brawls are not what I seek. I was raised with manners and proper etiquette has been instilled within me. 

In short something has come up where I need to have someone else with me for a bit to help make me feel secure, safe and protected while at home.
Oh and I'm going to install locks where there were none and I'm changing the others. Invasion of any kind whether it be home invasion, personal invasion or any other intrusions or acts that make a person not feel safe is pure evil, especially if it may not be a stranger. 
I'm very new to this area and haven't really met anyone yet. 
It would be nice if you know how to shoot and you wouldn't mind teaching me how to shoot. I prefer a rifle 1st before a handgun but that can be discussed. In the past I haven't had very good aim but I'm looking to improve. 

That is all I'm willing to share in reference to the circumstances I'm posting about on CL. 
I'm sitting here telling myself this is ridiculous but at this point what do I really have to lose? I definitely can sense a predator type whether they seem charming or not and my personal space and comfort zone has already been violated. 
My thoughts now are Freck it!!! I seek to have someone with me most nights until I get things sorted out. 
Also do understand I hate drama, I go out of my way to avoid drama and I do expect you to have very little drama. I'm only going to deal with the average normal % of drama that just comes with life. Otherwise stay out of my life. 
Yep, I'm not like most chics, in fact I think I'm a lot cooler than many of them. 
I'm good to those who are good to me. 
Others that I'm good to and I give them no name to place with a kind person who's helped them when in need, well that's between God and I.
So if you think you can hangout with me without too many questions asked and just enjoy one day at a time send me a response that has more than one sentence in it. 
Tell me about yourself and why I can have some initial trust in you and feel safe!?! Include a photo or I WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT RESPOND BACK!
Trust me when I say I'm highly intelligent and I'm fully aware how odd and nuts this post seems. Somethings are better not explained and that's where I stand on the subject at this time. If you are intelligent you'll have a good enough understanding on your own. 
Don't ask me my age just know I'm in my 30's, good to go!
Happy New Year!

My life is very full at the moment, but there is still something missing. I have 2 amazing children, a good job, a house, and my own car. I want for very little, but the lack of a man in my life is becoming an issue. I am a strong, independent woman, and I don't ""need"" a man in my life - I want to make that very clear. I want a man to share my already amazing life with. A man with integrity, who is kind, honest, respectful, considerate, and in control of his life. A man that will treat me like a queen, but understands I am not a damsel in distress. I want to find a man that will love me unconditionally and allow me to do the same. I want to settle down and create a new life with the man of my dreams. Craigslist may not be the perfect place for that, but until they create a Build-A-Man store, this is where I'm at. 

What I need from you is very simple, you MUST be single-I can't stress this enough!- I will not date a married man, so don't even try. You should have a steady job, transportation, and be ready to settle down with the right woman. I am looking for a serious relationship, not a fling. I don't mind if you have children, but I don't want any more of my own. I will be more than happy to blend our two families into a loving home. 

I live west of Benbrook. If this sounds appealing to you, please send me an email, and let's see if we hit it off.

This is probably the third time I've tried to find something meaningful, but no such luck. I'm a full time student at UNT and I also work full time, which means I'm an extremely busy girl. I'm hoping to find someone as ambitious as I am and that can give me a much needed push when necessary. I love to sing, read, and sit on the porch to enjoy a nice cold beer. I'm much more of a homebody than anything else, but I do love going out occasionally.

I don't care much about appearance and I definitely don't care about race. Age doesn't really matter, but I am 22. I care a lot more about personality, intellect, and ambition. If you think that we can make a meaningful connection, respond with a picture and little bit about yourself. Of course, I'll also send a picture. Put your favorite NFL team in the subject line. 

I hope to hear from you :)

If you are looking to fulfill some weird ass fantasy...dont waste your time. If you are gonna contact me to just keep me busy with a bunch of bs questions then disappear...dont waste your time. I am not stupid but some guys sure think i am. Life is too short for playing the crazy games. Now that has been said....i am looking for something real. I know it doesnt happen over night and dont expect it to, i am really tired of being that third wheel or doing things by myself. 

Im a career girl and at times it gets crazy. But i also know i need to find time to live my life outside of work. Im low maintenance, low drama, love to laugh and have fun. My interests are all over the place. Outdoors to indoors. More country tgan anything but enjoy city stuff too. Social drinker, non smoker. I'm 5'5"", a BBW (size 16) and very healthy. 

You...have your crap together. My biggest preference is a little younger than myself. So please....if you are in your 20s please dont reply. I promise i will delete it. Jyst tell me the basics about yourself and a pic. I am not a pic collector so no worries there.

I'm very real. Its cold today and the Patriots will be playing Kansas City here in a bit.

Why is dating so hard? It's supposed to be fun and exciting but lately it's been awful. I can't seem to find the right guy. Here is what I'm looking for

- educated
- funny/sarcastic 
- hard workings 
- likes to travel and has stamps in his passport from other countries than Canada or Mexico
- family oriented 
- health lifestyle
- wants kids some day
- non smoker
- passionate 
- understanding
- honest
- loyal

I wouldn't ask someone to be something that I am not. I am all those things listed above. I'm 35 single white female with no kids and a great job. I'm average looking and average in size. I work out five says a week work permitting. 

If interested please send a picture along with short summary on how you meet my criteria. 

Stay warm

Hello, I'm a 30 year old black female, with 1 kid. I'm looking for something more than just friendship but I'm not in a rush for anything. I am brand new to this Craigslist personal thing so bare with me lol. I have a homebody, that don't do too much of the clubbing scenes. Don't get me wrong I like to have fun, just not the type that feels the need to be in the clubs every weekend. I am a live band spoken words type of get out. I love to cook, read, watch movies, listen to music, dine, travel and I loooove sports. I am looking for something and someone that doesn't mind coming together as one and having the finer things in life. No that doesn't mean money and big house with 10 cars, I am not looking to build with someone that is about to be content one woman and making the best of it. I am about to move to the Atl area again in the next month, and will love to kick off something before I come to stay. I don't smoke and I rarely drink. I don't mind if you just don't be an alcoholic lol, not looking for someone crazy or a stalker either..... feel free to message me if you are interested your pic gets mine. Race is not an issue, I've never dated outside of my race but I'm open to it. NO CATFISHING PLS LOL
*****UPDATE*** 
IF YOU DONT HAVE A PICTURE OR REAL CONVERSATION PLEASE BYPASS ME. I'm new to CL Personals but I'm not desperate nor am I dumb. If you cant send a picture through email but have to get my number to send me one....and have no real conversation BYPASS ME. I'm not fixing to waste my time or argue with grown men about something as simple as a picture or a detail about you. I would like to get somewhat of a feel of who I am chatting with. Its always one that spoils it for everyone so with that being said respect my wishes, we swap pictures regardless of looks and we got to have real conversation through a few emails before I send you my number. That way no one time is wasted....ITS ALWAYS ONE. lol What a way to go trying this personals thing out.

It's funny, because all these new-fangled apps and websites keep cropping up, like Tinder and Zoosk and whatever else, but rather than making things easier, I think they've actually made things worse. People's attention spans are down to nothing. No one wants to get to know each other, they just want to fuck. Why bother nurturing anything with potential when there's something new and shiny a swipe away?

I suppose I'm an old fashioned girl in that I'm just looking for someone sweet, down to earth and funny. Someone I can have good conversations with, someone with a good head on their shoulders. Someone who is up for cuddling and adventures, staying in, going out, and fun - both in AND out of the bedroom. You know, like a normal relationship, where you spend time together, talk, get to know each other....

Maybe CL is the wrong place to look, too. Who knows? But it's worth a shot. I need a good, normal, sane man who is maybe equally disillusioned by how available ""dating"" is nowadays.

If you are between 25 and 40, have your shit together, are feeling lonely and want something more than just a hookup...then here's what you'll get in me. A sarcastic, sassy, energetic, cute and smart woman. Chubby, 27, a gamer, a geek, an intellectual, who enjoys movies, video games, cooking, being outside, live music, reading and a whole lot more. Sexy and sensual, caring, passionate, loyal, a chatterbox, a coffee addict and looking for the right guy (in all the wrong places).

Send me a message with ""Old School Love"" in the title and let me know about you! Maybe we can catch a spark that'll turn into something bigger. Your picture gets mine :)

I'm not entirely sure how to word this. I wanted to be married. I want stability. I want commitment.

I'm currently in college but I feel a bit lost. Something just doesn't feel right. Like this isn't the path I'm supposed to following. Over the holidays, I've been spending a lot of time getting my house in order and I've fucking love it. Cleaning, cooking, running errands. Just keeping the house together. Then I thought about it and maybe I'm supposed to be a housewife. 

I'm looking for someone who wants I guess to date to marry. Someone who'll support me in whatever I decide to do. Someone who'll mentor me and care for me. 

I want kids. Somewhere down the line. If you have kids already that's fine too. 

I want the romance and the passion. The dates and thrill of keeping you waiting while I get ready. I know this is a bit scatterbrained but I'm just writing it as it's coming to me.

That I just randomly threw up with some old bailing wire, burning trash, and watching the kids play at the big nice houses behind our old trailer house (because that's all I can afford after we left my abusive husband a few months back), thinking about how much I miss (and feel my kids deserve) the times where we had a nice home, a trampoline, and were able to afford trash service. After all, I served him like a King. I miss those times too. Every day my kids beg me to homeschool them, but I can't because I have to find another job (since I lost mine 2 weeks before Christmas), just so I can afford to feed them. Just reminiscing over all the good times, but learning to be content in ALL circumstances. One thing that they have at the 2 homes behind me that I NEVER had, was a husband out there playing with his kids, while the wife socialized with friends before jumping in to join. As I sit here, cold and lonely, burning trash, I am reminded this isn't forever. Perhaps when I learn to be completely content and joyous in ALL situations, perhaps then, HE will deliver us from this mess. 

Don`t really have a point in posting; just needed to vent. Perhaps someone out there has been there, and has some words of encouragement, cause I'm going to need them lol. =/

I know that I can easily expect several e-mails letting me know what I'm looking for is not on CL, but I like to hit all my bases. I'm looking to find someone I can build a connection with, build a friendship with, and hopefully a meaningful adult relationship with. I'm at a point in my life where I can honestly say I have what I need. I have a good job, good friends, supportive family, and a mind that has served me well so far. The thing about love and relationships is that you can't set up goals the way you would for anything else. While it would be nice to end up in a LTR, possibly leading to marriage and children, it's nothing that I can force. If I don't care who the person is, I can, as you can, get married within six month. I see it happen everyday. I however, am possibly like you, waiting for a connection, a cosmic connection if you will. I haven't stopped thinking that there's someone out there I can get to know so well I can feel him. A relationship where when we walk in the room everyone says to themselves, ""I wish I had that."" A connection so strong that we can communicate from across the room without even speaking. A bond where I can intuitively tell something is wrong with the other. Don't get me wrong, I know that this type of relationship and intimacy, emotional, physical, intellectual, and spiritual, takes time...but we can't work toward it if we don't know each other. I could conclude with the cliche personals ad info, job, likes, dislikes, hobbies, kids, pets, etc., but I won't. I can't imagine that if you're looking for the same thing I am, that we don't have something in common we can build a relationship on.

I'm looking for my lover, my best friend, my copilot for the rest of my life. Someone who appreciates the smaller things in life, because they really do matter. Someone who likes to have fun and joke around. Someone who won't get mad if I start a small food fight while we're baking - I mean, isn't cleaning each other up part of the fun, as well?

I need someone that doesn't mind showing affection and giving verbal affirmations that we are still connected and doing good.

That being said, I'm not just looking for sex.

I don't have a specific type, per se. Here's a list of qualities that I prefer over others:

• Affectionate
• Sensitive
• Healthy sex drive haha

Hi there
My name is Lola and I'm 35 ,I'm laid back, I love the outdoor, I like to meet new people, I'm good looking, fun to be with and I'm honest.
If i'm outdoors i'm a Happy girl, Free spirit, love to be by the water , lakes rivers beaches, camping, walks ,cinema, Bonfires all summer long,music just about all kinds of music. I like shopping and love precious stones and jewelries. I like to travel and I travel a lot cause of my work and it's fun
A good morning for me is opening up my eyes and seeing my other half with a smile ... I'm very ambitious and I want a man that is hard working. I got a small scale business I want to make a big one together with my soul mate, it's a long held dream I got to make me a complete and successful woman together with my soul mate. I'm positive and believe in hard work together as a partner to be in love and also be better persons we want to be. There is no limit to success hard work pays.
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough. I believe dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. I like to meet with a man that is successful, independent, laid back, knows how to treat a woman like a queen and also wants to make his woman a better woman not just want sex.

I'll admit it, I'm weird. Not creepy weird. I'm not typical for.I got my life together at a young age. (No kids, no marriage)

I don't want a fuck buddy, I don't want someone trying to marry me before.

And who people think ""my type"" is..isn't. 
Opposite to the fullest. I like to cook, I like to read. I love my job, I love advancing myself. 
And the most attractive person I've ever dated was my opposite. I'm white, blonde, ""bbw"", nerdy, regular gym goer, a few tattoos. 
He was mixed. Asian and black.
It wasn't a matter of fat/skinny, black/white. 
Mentally we were on the same level. He could play madden while I read, then we would yell at each other because we hated each other's teams. 

I mean maybe of the people who read this might understand, but probably not. Just because someone LOOKS a certain way, doesn't mean you won't chill or vibe on the same level. Like this dude that's the reason for this post. He was handsome. Looked comfy as hell. He looked relaxed. I wanted his mindset. What music do you listen to? I wanna play with your dreads. But there just simply isn't a chance in hell I would ever say anything. Because I wouldn't be his ""type"".

I.e; you never know who you're looking at.

Hello guys... Happy Rainy & Cold Saturday afternoon. Sitting at work right now, thinking how nice it would be to have someone yummy to snuggle up to with a movie after work.... but then remembered, i dont have anyone! I AM NOT looking for someone for tonight...just saying, in general...thats what i miss and am seeking... a special someone in my life. I am a genuine, educated, passionately crazy woman, with a great career in the medical field. I am down to earth, very active outdoors, loyal & trusting to a fault. Looking for a one in a million man!...probably not the best place to look, but hell why not?!? I am definitely wanting something that leads to long term, but you cant rush things like that. Im generally attracted to white / light skinned men. Tattoos are super sexy, not from head to toe, and not a requirement by any means. Please send me a pic. I cannot post here due to my job but will send back pictures on my first reply, if i have gotten one from you. Not into games, drama or bs. If you are married please dont respond to me. Put that energy into your wife and see how much happier your marriage can be. Hope to hear from you soon! -XO

Nice looking BF here. Dark skin, abundant curves.

I'm looking for something long term. If you have to mention the word ""discrete"" more than once, chances are you're too paranoid for me. Lol nobody's trying to break up families here and that should go without saying.

I am attached for now, so yes...restrictions apply.

Looking for a man who knows how to read. You prove it by avoiding some of the pitfalls mentioned below.

a.) You're not afraid to get close
b.) You're not looking for a hook up or booty call chick. If you're just looking to get your junk wet, please don't waste time for either of us.

c.) You understand mutual attraction is a factor. I'm not perfect and not looking for Brad Pitt but I'm not into really small (under 5'8-9) or really heavy men. I'm curvy with hips/thighs/decent bust (no, not huge geez lol)...so I don't want to feel like I could take a guy out with one punch either lol. 

No I don't ""mind"" white guys..I like y'all just fine, but I'm not an experiment or something for you to check off your bucket list. 

I am not meeting you tonight. If you're asking, that tells me a lot about you and why you're on CL. Keep it moving, pal.

If you're 25- 40, cute lol
decent looking, attractive, handsome or anything remotely fitting those descriptions, drop a line. I'm pretty darn cute and clean up nice so don't worry too much *wink*

I don't answer one line or non informative messages. If you send me ""What's up?"", you'll never find out. If you just ask ""Got any pics?"" same thing..I am telling you a LOT about me and what I'm looking for just in this ad so, if you respond, it'd be helpful not to ask questions already answered HERE. Same goes for men who send jackass messages, then once I respond accordingly you say ""Oh, but I didn't really think you were real."". Really?

If you send a pic of your dick you're clearly pathetic. I've seen them before and I can promise you, yours won't stand out...its just a dick. Keep it for your personal collection.

Pics get pics so please don't ask without sending first and I will happily supply.

Oh and if you think I'm a bitch just for being detailed about what I want and don't want? Its cool, just don't waste my time or yours by bothering to tell me.

Here it goes.. I've tried this before with out much luck but I'm thinking I'll try again and see what happens. You never know right?

There seems to be a plethora of men and women looking for sex and random hookups on here. I however am NOT one of them. Been there done that had my fun and I'm interested in more. 

Just a quick bit about me. I'm 34, long dark hair, blue eyes, 5'4 and around 230 so yes I'm a big woman. I guess some classify as a ( bbw ) but whatever.. I'm not trying to hide it or cover it up. I am comfortable in my own skin... I am silly, shy, kind, stubborn, and very passionate. I have some tattoos all tasteful and professionally done. I'm an only parent of one kiddo. I've got a great job, car, place of my own and I'm very self sufficient. I'm also very all natural in every way . While I am a big woman I do take care of myself, exercise , eat well, I've lost quite a bit of weight over the last few years and will continue to do so. Its a way of life now. I don't put chemicals on or in my body. I also don't shave I guess that's important to know. Oh! and I am non religious. 

I'm looking for a guy who is around my age, who I have things in common with. To me looks aren't everything but having chemistry is. I kinda have a thing for hairy natural guys but really I'm open to seeing what's out there. I feel like it goes with out saying but just to be safe it would be great if you are employed, have some form of transportation, not necessarily a car, and live on your own, or at least not with your parents. :) oh and single! That's important! 

Look... I'm not some picky, fancy, drama seeking chick. I have a quiet, simple, happy life. I go with the flow of things and try to be the best person and parent I can in any situation. I'm just looking for that person who gets me and respects me and who is looking for the same. If that's you... say hello and tell me a bit about you. We've really got nothing to lose. 

I do have pictures but I'd prefer to not post them online. 

Thanks for reading... hope to talk to you soon.

Good afternoon,
I recently moved here, and I am seeking a nice friend. I am very attractive, sexy and fun. I am outgoing and love sports.
I enjoy fine dining, traveling and shopping. I have been single for over a year now, and ready to date.
I have a three day weekend, so looking for someone to go out with. Let's chat a bit; perhaps meet later. I plan on going out to watch the game this evening.
You must be over 40 and attach a recent photo, to get my response. No three word sentence, and I am not into games. Don't waste my time!

We both have tats and I have piercings and we both smoke hookah and cigars. He is a U.S. Marine and is 29 I am 25 a stay at home mom, home maker, and currently in college. I am hoping to find people that can get along and be friends with my husband as I am with him most of the time but I am also looking for personal friends that I may be able to hang out with on the days that he can not be with me such as duty or deployment. I want to make it very clear I am deeply in love with my man I am in no way or fashion looking to cheat or add another to our alone time. We enjoy just about anything and everything and have a wide variety of interests. I of course love country he is mostly into classic rock. We love horror movies and cartoons. We have our own place in Fallbrook and often have BBQs and Bible studies. Hit me up if you are interested.

I am a 67 yr. old, extremely well-kept full-figured widow looking for a friend first that has the potential of turning into a lasting committed relationship. I have a great personality & love life. I am genuine, simple, caring, honest, trustworthy, loyal, friendly, romantic, family orientated person with a heart of gold, always putting others first before myself. I am self-sufficient, own my house & car & would expect the same from you. I have extremely high old-fashioned morals, so if you're looking for a one night stand, please move on. I'm not the one for you. I cannot deal with cheating, lies, drama or drinking in excess. 
I like walking on the beach or piers, holding hands & talking about things we both enjoy. Enjoy coffee. yard sales, thrift shops, TV/movies, breakfast/lunch/dinner, BBQ/swimming in my pool, internet cafe's, traveling, people watching, fishing, or etc. or just hanging out at home with that special person. Enjoy classic country or 50's music. Love seeing nature at it's finest...sunrises, sunsets, thunderstorms, or watching the stars at night. My only fault is smoking an occasional cigarette & have difficulty walking long distances, at times.
You must be white, not married, family-orientated & only drink occasionally, not in excess. Honesty faithfulness & communication are a must. Not into playing games. Please contact me if you would like to know more about me. Tell me a little about yourself such as age, widowed/divorced, have children, general location of where you live & where were you born & raised. Pictures can be exchanged later, as I do not post pictures on craigslist. I prefer to talk directly on the phone vs. endless emails. I would certainly love to find a great companion/special friend to share great times & our future with. At our age, life is too short to be alone. My favorite song is ""When You Wish Upon A Star"". Let's see if fate can bring us together.

Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a car. 

Experience is a wonderful thing. It enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again. 

Don't worry about what people think, they don't do it very often. 

If you look like your passport picture, you probably need the trip. 

No man has ever been shot while doing the dishes. 

Opportunities always look bigger going than coming. 

Eat well, stay fit, die anyway..... (But taking care of yourself makes the journey so much more rewarding.) 

If you are reading this, you may be closer to the end than you are to your beginning, so make the most of what's left. 

If any of this resonates with you, please introduce yourself. I won't bite, unless of course, you want me to.... 

I'm the real deal: Cute, bright, energetic, accomplished, generous, ""been there, done that""....desirous of a worthy counterpart with whom to share my feminine charms and eclectic circles of friends. 

My soul mate loves to play as intensely as he loves his work. Enjoys helping around the house, (loves tools) and providing for his lover, and is not a snob. Intelligence is hot; but a sense of humor is vital. So are compassion, tolerance, generosity of spirit. and open-mindedness. 

I'm not interested in a passive person or hanging out with negativity. I'm a live-wire and hope to encounter and woo a man with an optimistic attitude, who is passionate and enjoys self-expression. We don't always need to agree. ""Vive la difference!"" Just be willing to share your views in an articulate way and be willing to consider a situation from another perspective. 

I want meet a man who truly enjoys the emotional and physical aspects of a relationship. I've already raised my children, who are successful, contributing members of society. This is not about merging assets and security. This is about happiness and finding a comfy fit. Will you raise your hand?

I want someone to start over with. Someone who, like me, is scarred but not bitter, hurting yet still hopeful. I do not believe that you will fix me, complete me, or fill the holes in my life. I do not believe I can fix you, complete you, or fill the holes in yours. We can't rescue each other. 

I cannot give a laundry list of traits I am looking for, because I have come to believe that relationships are not about what your partner can do for you, but about what you and your partner can build together. I don't need your money, I don't want reflected status from you, and I am not assessing your suitability as a father (edited to add: I do not want children, but have an open heart if you have some). I do want you to be my lover, my confidante, my fiercest supporter, and a very close friend. I want to be those things for you in return.

I want to build a safe, warm relationship with you, filled with honesty, but with plenty of space to fail. With intimacy and closeness, but with the solemn promise to be the guardians of one another's solitude. I want to build a loving community around ourselves, and to create a space for constant self-improvement and learning. 

We can be partners in crime, and really good quiet-time companions. Let's skip down the street, try something new, have a deep conversation, and take a nap together -- preferably in the same day.

I have a big, open heart, a willing laugh, and a thirsty brain. I am curious to know everything about you, and quirks are way more interesting to me than perfection. I want to know where you have been before you met me, and I want to walk in the same direction together going forward. Take my hand, and we'll figure it out together.

Here is what you get with me:
1. Home cooked meals couple times a week.
2. Active girlfriend who is up for any activity from swimming to golf. Currently work has been getting in the way of my activity level, need to change that.
3. Here is a bad habit to be fair.. I am a bad sleeper, but hoping finding a sleep partner may change that bad habit.
4. Travel partner. I have lots of flexibility in my schedule. Last year I had some good trips, need to plan this year.
5. I like spicy foods. Can you handle your spice ?
6. Big fan of SF. You must be too.
7. Non smoker, would be great it you loved wine.
8. I eat meat and seafood. No picky eaters.
9. Looking for a real connection.
Surprised that is ridiculously hard to find.
10. 41 and looking for similar aged guy.

I am not looking for a hook up or a f**k buddy. I am a very intelligent woman with a great career and my own house. I am not looking for a man's money. I am looking for someone who I can share interests with, spend time with and hopefully become a long term relationship. 

I work in IT so it would be good if the man is a techy, but not essential. I am liberal so it is probably best if the man isn't a raging Trump supporter though I am open to political debates, as I enjoy them - I am very knowledgeable about politics and love to talk politics and current affairs.

I am looking for someone who is good with children (I have two), good with animals (we have two dogs plus a lot of animals), someone with a good heart who cares about the less fortunate, as I do. Someone who likes to go out for meals (I love all kinds of food - esp thai, chinese, italian, indian). Who likes to go for a drink occasionally.. who won't mind that I like to go karaoke and dancing (he can come too if he likes!!). Someone who likes to go for walk - up Kennesaw Mountain, down by the Chattahoochee river, perhaps go fishing with the kids.. Maybe go to Six Flags or White Water with the kids (or the zoo, stone mountain etc.).

I like to read and am very well read but my partner does not have to be. 

If my partner liked to do DIY projects around the house that would be good too - I am trying and failing to do all my DIY projects right now!!

I really fall for men taller than 5ft 9 with dark hair and olive skin (esp Italian) but the chemistry can be there with other guys too - that is just a preference..

If any of this has struck a chord with you please contact me.

By the way my divorce should go through this week, so technically I am not quite divorced, but we have been living separate lives for 4 and a half years.

It is part of human nature, a part of life that everyone is not going to like everything. Whether it is another person, a certain brand of clothing, food, etc... Everything isn't for everybody. It takes some of us a little longer to become mature enough to realize like that and how to handle it and expressing it.

I am a 34 year old African American woman who is full-figured with defined curves. Not only do I consider myself a classy, tasteful woman, I am also very sweet and pretty easy-going. So you will find yourself comfortable with me immediately and captivated by my intelligence on a variety of subjects.

I enjoy being around those that are very optimistic, and love being with gentlemen that have as big of a heart as I do. Not only should this gentleman have a very big heart but they should also be established, educated and confident. And be willing to take pressure of making heavy choices off of my shoulders and explore the finer things in life. Who wants to do any of that alone?

So.... How do we continue the conversation?

Hello there...I am an African American, 5'10"", very attractive, dynamic, entertaining, professional singer, who is anointed, open minded, progressive, and I love and have a passion for cooking! I am hoping I meet a man that loves what I consider to be ""real old school"" food. That means pig feet, greens, neckbones, chitterlings with hog mawls with home made chow-chow (can you handle this?). It gives me joy to serve my food to someone who loves it and shows me that he does! I enjoy going out to eat also. Would like to meet a great guy to spend quality time with and hopefully develop a lasting relationship. I am gifted in sales, singing and design. Excited and uplifted about the future. Love to travel, go dancing, antiques, aquariums, swap meets, bed and breakfast, culture, the arts, singing gospel and jazz, community service, and ministering to and with my man. I believe that your home should be your place of refuge and serenity. In my spot, you will find water features, soft music, aromatherapy, sweet vibes and sensations. It is a place where you long to be, not that you want to be away from. I have many God given gifts and am awaiting the man who can recognize and be supportive of them. I enjoy a gentleman and welcome chivalry!

You have been through some tough times in your life and prevailed over it all. It has only made you stronger and wiser. Inside, there is a void that can only be filled by having a faithful, secure, passionate and loving partner. You want someone special in your life who can appreciate you. You also know how to handle business and place God first. Chivalry is alive in my life and I am a lady that wants a gentleman. I still believe in courting.

Not looking for males but one real man with character. Do not need the one like today ""will you f___me"". I do believe after 17 days of my last post he is the one that flagged my ad after I responded ""how rude"". No not looking for sex. Looking for someone to eventually love and be loved back by. So do not need to be asked anything sexual because that is what I am NOT about right now. Been a widow for 7 years and not met anyone yet that I have wanted to have a relationship with. I am 57 so probably need for just my age and older to reply. So please those of you that are only looking for superficial people leave this person out of your games.

I am highly attracted to androgynous people, regardless of their sex. I am looking to meet some androgynous people in the area, as I have not had much luck meeting people since I moved here. I am a 33 year old masculine female (I hate that I have to describe myself that way and it does not mean that I am incredibly muscular) that does not follow social norms and does not have expectations of how people should be. I want to meet people that are beautiful on the inside, as I am sapiosexual as well. I have a quick wit and a great sense of humor. My interests include, pro football, reading, play sports, video games, biking, hiking, playing with my dogs, attending concerts/arts/events, museums, and just sitting outside talking. Emotional intelligence is of the utmost importance to me, as I am highly intelligent both emotionally and intellectually. I hate small talk and thrive on deep conversations or just sitting listening to/feeling music. As far as my physical appearance is concerned, I am mixed ethnicity with mocha skin, 5'7, broad build and stocky. I have short hair with an undercut, think similar to Ruby Rose. Btw she is my biggest celebrity crush.

If you are looking to meet someone different from the others you have met before I would love to talk to you. Please be aged 28-43.

I'm open to couples. I get along with other submissive females best, but we can talk about it if she's a switch or dominant.

I'm not new to the lifestyle, but I try to treat a relationship like it's my first in that I don't expect it to be like a past relationship. I don't have favorite activities. New things are fun. This is something that is more than sexual for me. I'd like to have other things that we enjoy doing together. 

I have blue/ gray eyes and blond hair. I'm 5' 3"" and am at the smaller end of the bbw category. I am in the middle of getting to a healthy size. Please, be supportive of this or at least indifferent to it. I have some body art.

Will someone ride in on a white horse and save me from my life? I've always been strong and didn't think I needed saving, but in this regard, I was wrong. 

I decided to post this here because 99% of the guys in the platonic section are just looking for a quick lay. I'm hoping I might find men of substance here instead.

I'll be happy to explain at a later date. I don't plan to leave my husband, and I would never ask anyone to leave their situation either.

So, I'm basically looking for a relationship. I know I'm married, and that's hard and probably weird, but i think it could work out. I know I'm not the only one dissatisfied with my marriage, so why can't I find someone who wants an emotional relationship? I would like to start as friends, but it's my hope that something deeper can come from it. If this sounds like something you might be interested in, I'd love to hear from you. 

I'm in the 25-35 range, Bbw, brown hair, green eyes, and glasses. I try my best to always be kind, caring, and compassionate. My life is really tough, so I have a lot of empathy for others. I love to laugh and be silly, so I prefer if you do too. I don't have many preferences, I just want to see who and what's out there.

I hope I'm not posting in the wrong section or whatever but basically I'm tired of not having a guy to hangout with. I'm single and i would prefer you be single because cheating is not wassup. We would go on dates, talk , chill and have good sex lol. A little about me . I'm AA. 180lbs so nooo I'm not skinny or whatver. I drink. Smoke sometimes. Few tattoos and piercings. Pretty laid back person. I can and pics if you do. I'd prefer a Mexican or Black man just because i usually don't have that much in common with others....put FWB in the subject line And let's see where it goes

Hi. I'm looking for a fun guy between the ages of 45-55 to become friends with first and see where it goes. Some of my interests are Concerts,Camping,Bbqing, Lake George.. If interested please send a picture. NOT looking for a hook-up.

So here we go -- Giving this a try because I think all of the profiles on dating sites are probably fake or everywhere but here in Texas. Looking for a local nice guy. 

This is craigslist so not picture is posted but I have plenty to share -- send me several of you and some stories about you. 

Widowed / Single independent 32you lady living in Dallas -- Great Shape Fit Lady -- Blond Hair. Looking for a fun guy to hang out with having a hard time figuring out the dating scene over the past year -- more country than I am city. Very active coach my son's football and baseball teams -- runner / on tennis league so very active. Enjoy bike riding around. I am highly educated and a great career. 

Enjoy country western dancing and would like to find a partner for that again.

So the drama stuff -- Widowed four years ago my husband was taken away from us in Iraq in 2012 -- I have a nine year old son that is the focus of my life. I am from Arkansas but enjoy Texas. Not really so much looking for right now for a boyfriend or husband. Not looking for ""hook ups"". I am not looking for pity or handouts. I have gone through all the stages of grief and moving on with life. My husband wouldn't expect me to sit around and hide from society. 

Any motor heads out there? I enjoy boats, quads, nascar and stuff -- Have a non-working 2009 Honda Quad that has been sitting for a few years would like to get it going so I can teach my son how to ride, it leaks oil and I have a few seals and parts that are in a box back before my husband deployed overseas. Took it to a honda dealership but they wanted over two grand to fix it which is crazy as I think we only paid like five for it new. Maybe someone would fix it for exchange of Chicken Fried steak and mash dinner followed by apple pie? Any mechanic type guys? (:

Send me a couple pics and tell me about yourself and we can go from there. It has to be more than the words ""what's up"" -- sending pics of yourself means more than just a headshot -- normal life pics

Have any date ideas? Maybe hang out -- Not huge into going to an expensive restaurant would rather go to an event or bum around.

You must have a job and be self-sufficient. I am not looking for a boyfriend at this stage just a nice guy to be a companion right now. I am not looking to take care of a guy -- no couch surfers. Age range -- 28 to 48. . .

No married guys, no divorcing guys or other guys with drama in their lives. You should live here in Dallas. No drunks, No Drug, No Cigarettes, No Cigars, No 420 / Pot -- I am not a bar / club person. 

You must like dogs as I have a very pushy yellow lab.

When I say pictures that does not equal a private parts picture of your man toy - I am not a girl that requires a minimum size equipment on a guy so don't worry about showing it off.

so this is something different I'm trying...

I've made one other post about the type of guy I'm looking for and a little about me, but the conversation fades after a week or two. so I'm thinking let's just chat as if we just met at a random location. 
I figure start with a baseline of friendship and if we get along from there then anything after should be easy, right?
I'm real and to prove you're real put the place you'd like to meet in the subject line. :-)

I am very active, sweet, smart ass and just a fun girl to be around! I am very upbeat and always smiling.. 

I'm looking for someone who is like me, that knows what it is to crave contact with another person. The hug that lasts forever the kiss that lingers on your lips. The instant smile when a text or phone call comes across your phone. I am attached in name only and I long to feel these things again. 

I am attractive and in shape and have it all together I want you to be the same. I want to spend my free time with one person who can have me on cloud 9 BUT also awaken the devil in me.

Might sound cheesy but I'm looking for a relationship and I want that whole cheesy dating thing. I'm 32 and I feel pretty old because it seems like everyone wants a one night stand. I'm not looking for a one night stand or fwb. I'm just out of a long term relationship (going through a divorce) but I'd like to start dating. I'm not looking to get married or anything crazy like that anytime soon but do want to get married again, eventually. 

I'm white, 5'9"", curvy and working on getting fit. I'm normally attracted to guys that are taller than I am and who are skinny. But I have dated guys that don't match that description. Intelligence is a big turn on for me. Lovingly correct my grammar and I'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. ;) (I might be exaggerating a bit but try it out and we'll see.)

It gives me joy to serve my food to someone who loves it and shows me that he does! I enjoy going out to eat also. Would like to meet a great guy to spend quality time with and hopefully develop a lasting relationship. I am gifted in sales, singing and design. Excited and uplifted about the future. Love to travel, go dancing, antiques, aquariums, swap meets, bed and breakfast, culture, the arts, singing gospel and jazz, community service, and ministering to and with my man. I believe that your home should be your place of refuge and serenity. In my spot, you will find water features, soft music, aromatherapy, sweet vibes and sensations. It is a place where you long to be, not that you want to be away from. I have many God given gifts and am awaiting the man who can recognize and be supportive of them. I enjoy a gentleman and welcome chivalry!

You have been through some tough times in your life and prevailed over it all. It has only made you stronger and wiser. Inside, there is a void that can only be filled by having a faithful, secure, passionate and loving partner. You want someone special in your life who can appreciate you. You also know how to handle business and place God first. Chivalry is alive in my life and I am a lady that wants a gentleman. I still believe in courting. Thank you and looking forward to hearing from you...

Please have your crap together, I do. I'm independent. Many interests and very open to trying new things. I'm a bbw (size 16). If you have an issue with that don't reply. I don't need or want your negative comments. Please be real and serious as I am. Open to where this may lead. Please respond with a bit about yourself and a pic. I'm not a pic collector. I'm really tired of talking to guys that say they are serious and then disappear when I mention meeting. Not into forever emails and texts. Extremely tired of the BS.

I also do live in Corsicana, so I'm assuming whatever I find will be long distance. Because of that, we will be phone buddies before anything else.

My Husband and I have recently decided to split. I have been out of practice with the whole dating scene for 6 years now. So bare with me if I'm kind of rusty. 

I am not a small woman but I don't feel as if I am a full BBW. I am on the smaller BBW size, if that makes sense. I am working on finding myself and finding what I enjoy to do. I like to play sports, soccer, softball. I like to go fishing, not really into hunting but it doesn't bother me if you go. I will be honest and say that I have a hard time trusting people, everyone of my last relationships (including my husband) had cheated on me. 

I am hoping to find someone who can prove to me that I can trust you and you wont break my trust. I prefer you to be around 5' 10 or taller. Muscles and tattoos have always been a turn on for me., but its not a deal breaker. I just want to find someone I can have fun with, someone who isn't all about themselves. I should also add that I am looking for someone between the ages of 27-35 

I do have kids so you must be OK with that. 

If you've made it this far and think that we may hit it off please feel free to email me. Please put your favorite sport in the subject line and send a picture, no penis pictures.

I'm not sure why my post got deleted, but I'm reposting. Yesterday was Super Tuesday and I voted in the primary!

First and foremost, I am a BBW/SSBBW, so if that isn't your thing, please move along!
I am looking to date and I am open to the possibility of something serious. I'm not looking to rush into anything, but I'm not looking for just sex. I'm not looking for FWB or a fuck buddy. That isn't what I'm into. Please don't waste my time or yours.

I'm 22, almost 23. I have red hair and tattoos. I'm a college grad with a career in finance. I'm looking for someone educated and close to my age.
I have a car and place of my own. I live in Arlington near UTA.
I like stand up comedy, going to concerts and movies, going to happy hour with friends.
I love football. GO PACK GO! If you're a football fan, you get extra points.
Extra points also go to those with beards and tattoos.

I am looking for someone close to my age. I won't reply to anyone over 36.

Please send a photo when you reply and put a little about you in the e-mail. No pic = no reply.

I am highly attracted to androgynous people, regardless of their sex. I am looking to meet some androgynous people in the area, as I have not had much luck meeting people since I moved here. I am a 33 year old masculine female (I hate that I have to describe myself that way and it does not mean that I am incredibly muscular) that does not follow social norms and does not have expectations of how people should be. I want to meet people that are beautiful on the inside, as I am sapiosexual as well. I have a quick wit and a great sense of humor. My interests include, pro football, reading, play sports, video games, biking, hiking, playing with my dogs, attending concerts/arts/events, museums, and just sitting outside talking. Emotional intelligence is of the utmost importance to me, as I am highly intelligent both emotionally and intellectually. I hate small talk and thrive on deep conversations or just sitting listening to/feeling music. As far as my physical appearance is concerned, I am mixed ethnicity with mocha skin, 5'7, broad build and stocky. I have short hair with an undercut, think similar to Ruby Rose. Btw she is my biggest celebrity crush.

If you are looking to meet someone different from the others you have met before I would love to talk to you. Please be aged 28-43.

Hi! 
This is a total shot in the dark, but if I don't try, I'll never know. 
Don't mistake me for crazy, I'm just tired of wasting time. I'm really a sweet, open minded person. & yes, this is going to be a long read, sorry lol.

I'm looking for someone, who has the want to get married and have children. Whether it's next year or in 5 years. You can have children, I have one. I absolutely love kids. I want someone who understands fully what marriage entails, and respects it 100%. Who understands that if we ever went left, we could be friends until we got back right. I want one marriage, and although I can't fight a divorce, and I won't, I don't believe in it at all. Intimacy is also so important to me, it's not just about sex, and I need someone who understands what real intimacy is.

Anyways, before I keep rambling about marriage and kids and scare you off, I am totally fine with meeting and seeing where things go, that's usually how this goes ;) I just don't want to date someone who doesn't desire those things. 


IF YOU CAN TAKE SARCASM AND THROW IT BACK, call me lol.

Anyways, 
Hi! My name is Kate. I'm a single mom, I work at Boeing in Seattle (I am currently in the process of buying a home in Texas) I use to live next to SAFB, in Wichita falls. I'm currently going to school to get an MBA. (Masters of business of administration) I just sold my business. I am not fat or chubby, I work out 5 times a week, but I'm definitely curvy after having a child lol. My dad is my best friend, he raised me basically all alone. I do have tattoos (nothing distasteful) , they all have meaning to me. And I have a few hidden piercings. I have blonde hair and blue eyes. I don't believe in what Christianity has become, but I was baptized Christian & I do believe in God, whether you do or not, is not a big deal to me. Im not the kind of person to force my opinions on people, and i like people for who they are, I would never try to change anyone I come across. However, I love hearing people's opinions, educating and being educated on different things. I love to conversate, but I also like quiet nights too. I have a 3 year old, the sweetest person you will ever meet, she is a total tomboy cowgirl lol. She is apart of everything I do, and I raise her mostly alone. Her dad sees her sometimes but probably won't be seeing her much after we move. &No! There is absolutely no drama there. We are respectful to each other and the situations we are in. We have been separated for 3 years now. I love to be active! I also like some lazy days. I wear blue jeans and tshirts often, but I love getting dolled up :) I love Camping, four wheeling, hiking, working out. I'm an avid figure skater, for the last 13 years. I love HOCKEY! I love going to races, I have traveled to several different states and events to watch them. I literally have 50+ racing sweatshirts lol. I love sports, football & baseball are my favorite. I love music, I listen to it all, i sing, so I'll be the girlfriend who constantly breaks out in song lol. I literally listen to everything from Hank Williams Jr., Tim McGraw (hiring him to sing at my wedding for sure lol) Johnny Cash, Five finger death punch, Big smo, hinder, Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, Bon Jovi, Etta James lol. I need someone who isn't afraid to be silly and open with me. You must be able to dance with me, even though I don't know how lol. You must burst out singing with me in the truck lol. I am extremely attracted to older men ( mid 30's especially lol) but as long as you have your life together, and are mentally stable, I don't care how old you are. Anyways, if I haven't lost you yet, I want to get to know you, so I'll stop talking about me. :) I'll send pictures after your response. Please be able to skype or FaceTime with me sometime! I am 100% real, and will even fly down to see you before I make the move, if it's serious enough.

I posted this before as ""Curvy and Herpes, what more could you want?"" but it seemed to invite people to ridicule my situation, so I tries something different in the title. (then it got flagged. If I'm not your thing that's cool, but I'm real and those std sites are not used much ) Same post though as it is still true:

Let's just cut to the chase: Herpes is either a big deal to you, or not.
So if you have educated yourself, you know that it is difficult to pass (2-4% chance from woman to man) but I just need to you be cool with it or have it yourself. I've had it a couple years but never had an outbreak, so it isn't on my radar until I have to have the ""talk"" with someone and it is just not something I want to have to keep doing. Getting it out in the open is much easier. Okay, on to things that actually matter to those of you who got this far. . .
I'm 50 years old, divorced with grown children. I am looking for love /connection /LTR, BUT we all know that starts with friendship. Age range.. Probably above 35.. I've dated most races(I'm white) and really it's all about being similar enough to relate and different enough to be interesting. I love my life and I'm looking for a connection. While I have my act together, I find I am always learning and growing and finding new things I want to try or learn about. Not daily, but I'm an open-minded person. I don't smoke, but I am cool with 420. Also, I am a curvy girl, so if you really only like slim, petite or athletic, you probably should move on.
OK.. your turn.
If you really need a picture of me right away, send yours. If you just ask me for a picture, I'm going to think you never read to the end of my post and are just a con man (yes, that is what we women run into). Please do tell me a little bit about yourself when you reply.

Hey there!

So usually I wouldn't even think to post on craigslist, unless I wanted some kind of excitement in my life so I figured why not? We only live once right? 

A little bit about me: I'm a chubby, pretty Hispanic young woman who enjoys professional wrestling and The Walking Dead. I'm fairly intelligent about some subjects (like animals OMFG who doesn't love animals?) and others not so much (politics are interesting but they do bore me). I currently do work, but I'm at a point in my life I want to make a career out of the place I'm working at and not simply just work there just to work there, so I am looking for other jobs at the moment as well. I was born and raised in good old Texas, and pretty much have the kind, friendly Texan attitude everyone is installed with. I'm shy when you first get to know me, but after I get comfortable I can be wild, random and pretty outgoing. :) I like just about every type of music out there, but my all time favorites have to be Bon Jovi and Def Leppard. Classic rock is the bomb case closed! 

I am a straight edge Christian, but don't let the title fool you. I'm not going to thump the Bible over your head or try to ""save"" you, nor am I going to judge you because you prefer to drink and smoke weed or do drugs. Personally, I could really care less who people believe in or what they do, because ultimately what you do in life is...well your business. I have friends who aren't Christians, who drink, who smoke, who've done some hardcore shit, and even though I can give an opinion I still respect everyone's decision to do what they want. The only things I ask is that you give me the same respect, and don't pressure me to do anything. I don't mind people drinking in front of me or even casually smoking a cigar or cigarette, but smoking weed or doing drugs in front of me is something I won't tolerate. 

Now that you have some kind of sense about me, let me explain my situation: Currently I am in a relationship, but there's something missing. My boyfriend is less affectionate and less caring than he originally was with me, and we are struggling. We both don't want to break up with each other, but there's a lot of clashing between us. I came down to the fact I NEED a distraction. Someone to sweep me off my feet, and just accept me for me. Be there for me not only physically, but mentally and emotionally. 

Do I want a side relationship? Yes. Do I want a side boyfriend on the down low? Yes. That is the kind of distraction I need, and possibly it may even help me rekindle my relationship now. Honestly, I'm looking for, in lack of better words, a best guy friend. Somebody I can laugh with, hang out with, go to for advice, snuggle with, make out with, and maybe even have sex with. I do want some kind of connection, not a ""lets fuck and leave"" situation. I would like to be spoiled every now and then by this best guy friend, but let's be clear I'm not looking for a sugar daddy.

I'm interested in men older than me (I am 22, 23 in April), and as long as you're good looking and/or fairly interesting I have no age limit. I will admit I'm very attracted to white men who are taller than me (I'm 5'2"") and have either an athletic or stocky built (but generally body type doesn't matter to me as long as you're healthy and carry yourself well). 

If you've made it this far and seem pretty interested definitely send me an email! Let's get to know each other and see where it goes! Put you're favorite animal in the subject line so I can weed out the spam. PLEASE INCLUDE A PIC IN YOUR REPLY. And I will send one back in return. I'm real, Wrestlemania 32 is coming to Dallas and no robot can say that :P

So life sucks. I'm getting a divorce. Truth is I love being married and only being with one man but the one I chose is NO Bueno. 
What I would love to find.
A skinny white guy with blue eyes that listens to all types of music. Tattoos are ok. If you are crazy and emotional I am cool with it. Because I struggle with being emotional. I'm mistaken for being cold. I'm just reserved and a quiet person. 
I'm 36 but look younger. I'm Hispanic and white. Please send a picture. Not interested in private parts guys. I'm not going to go out with you because u have a giant peepee. Besides I can do more with average. Lmao...ps I don't do drugs and never have. I don't care for weed but don't see it as a drug either.

I realize this is in the relationship section. But before we can become bedroom partners we must meet and become friends. A meeting for me so that I can see who you are. That will tell me a lot. I don't want to do endless emails with out meeting first. Loneliness isn't fun and I've been doing it for a long while. My goal with this add is to find that special someone that wants to enjoy life and likes adventure. I am a widowed senior lady living in Roundup. The walls don't do conversation very well and the 3 cats and 2 dogs have their own language that I don't understand very well. LOL I am a clean lady and keep a clean house minus a little dog and cat hair. LOL I love to be outdoors weather permitting, fishing and hunting, yard work what ever needs attention. I also enjoy the indoors with that very special someone, cuddling, laughing, general conversation. Laughter makes for a fun day. There is no alcohol or drugs in my home and smoking is done on the porch. I own my home and 2 vehicles. They aren't much but they are mine. I am looking into selling out and moving to a warmer climate because I'm tired of fighting the cold and snow alone. It will take someone very special to change my mind. Are you that someone? If so you will need to convince me. 
In your response please put your age and a recent picture. Put Fun in the subject line so I can find it when it goes to my spam folder. No picture no reply. An informative reply will get my attention. No 1 liners. I will send a picture back. Thank you for reading this and have a wonderful day.

Hello fellas. 

I am a 29 y/o woman looking to meet that special man. I'm originally from the Inland Empire, and have been living in LA for about 4 years now. 

About me. I'm in school. My major is Administration of Justice. I love love discussing America's CJ System with those who also find it interesting and have a great respect for law enforcement. 
I'm a very outgoing, bubbly gal. I love to make people laugh and i'm a prankster, so if we ever meet, consider yourself warned. 
I like to stay active. Power walking and yoga are my first love in terms of physical activity. I'm a big kid at heart so I like going to places like Sky Zone. It's so much fun. I'm a foodie, so I like going to restaurants. Absolutely no fast food. Yuck. 
Hmm. I don't wanna give too much away. 

I like men who are respectful, has a good sense of humor. Romantic, a man of faith. I like men my age. Tall and in shape. 

So, if you like my post, let's chat and get to know each other. 
Please reply with age and pic.

As the title states I am an African American lady interested in dating interracially. I have before so if you haven't and you're just curious or looking to experiment this isn't the ad for you. Read whole ad before you reply,please. 

Basics you need to know about me. I am new to the area, I am looking for something serious, I am 20, I am a BBW, I have a corny sense of humor, I don't drive and I have no children. I am very smart and not ghetto at all. 

I do have a thing for beards, muscles,tattoos, nice hair, tall guys, and guys who are thin to thick build(not bigger than me). I do prefer you to be 21-35. If you are older than 25 ask yourself if you're appealing to a 20 year old who knows what she wants before you reply. I absolutely love smart men! That's the best characteristic you could have besides a good sense of humor and good heart. I am southern so I do still believe in chivalry. I guess I'm old at heart lol 

I am still growing as a person so I have a wide variety of interests. Please be close to Denton. I'm not looking for a email relationship, I want to go on actual dates and get to know you. I'm also not looking for hookups,Fwb, or a Netflix and chill type of situation. So Don't ask.

If you're interested send a picture and tell me a little about you.

My Husband and I have recently decided to split. I have been out of practice with the whole dating scene for 6 years now. So bare with me if I'm kind of rusty. 

I am not a small woman but I don't feel as if I am a full BBW. I am on the smaller BBW size, if that makes sense. I am working on finding myself and finding what I enjoy to do. I like to play sports, soccer, softball. I like to go fishing, not really into hunting but it doesn't bother me if you go. I will be honest and say that I have a hard time trusting people, everyone of my last relationships (including my husband) had cheated on me. 

I am hoping to find someone who can prove to me that I can trust you and you wont break my trust. I prefer you to be around 5' 10 or taller. Muscles and tattoos have always been a turn on for me., but its not a deal breaker. I just want to find someone I can have fun with, someone who isn't all about themselves. I should also add that I am looking for someone between the ages of 27-35 

I do have kids so you must be OK with that. 

If you've made it this far and think that we may hit it off please feel free to email me. Please put your favorite sport in the subject line and send a picture, no penis pictures.

I'm a single white female in search of a man to get to know and start a relationship. I'm 37, 5'6, busty/curvy attractive woman with a great sense of humor, intelligent and passionate. I enjoy spending time outdoors, shooting, back roads, bonfires and beer. So yes, I am very much a country girl but I get all dolled up too. I'm also a huge music lover, all genres. I like to cook and read, spend time with family and friends and ultimately that special someone. I do have a son so I want a man that understands that and if we get to the point I want him to be a good role model to my son. I'm a very affectionate and sensual woman so chemistry is very important. Age wise I'd prefer someone close to my age or older, 45-46 being the limit. I want someone that shares common interests and enjoys our time together. I am attracted to tall men with tattoos. And I love big arms. I really prefer alpha men. Chemistries and intimacy plays a large part in this. So, please reply with a little about yourself and what your looking for and where you live please. Also, send a picture and I will send mine to see if we're both interested. Thanks.

I have really bad scars from an accident I had as a child. **The photo is a picture of an ex model turned burnsurvivor named Turia Pitt. ** I read about her story and how her relationship was able to pull through the trauma of her accident. Although it's a bit of a reach for me, I am hopeful that despite the absence of the right guy, its possible for me too. 

So coupled with the outcome of my injury and growing up in a conservative household, I consider myself a bit of a late bloomer. The scars on my face are my biggest regret because as you can imagine people's stares aren't always kind. So in anticipation of eye contact, I tend to look away. Trust me, I'm working on it and it's getting better with time. 

My personality is adaptable. In many instances like work and school, I'm a social butterfly and a relatively confident person. But when it comes to social environments where I'm meeting people who aren't familiar with me and especially where dating or flirting happens, I tend to flounder and not know what to do... While this seems like a venting session, I'd like to hope there's someone who's out there who can relate and or want to get to know me, despite the obvious challenges I'm getting over.

I have made some strides in the dating area, I guess. The other day I met someone I was chatting with from tinder and it went fine. We met once after a few days and then another time after a few weeks of talking. I just don't think it's going anywhere because subtle things indicated that he didn't respect me or my time... I'll leave it at that. But for some reason a few days after the second meet up we just stopped checking in. Despite that upset, I did learn through that experience that in spite of feeling singled out and unlovable; I realized how many, if not all people sometimes feel that way. 

Simply put by a bar buddy I met at the Continental Dinner while waiting forty-five minutes for my date to arrive (oops, I said I wouldn't get into that), the buddy said we all have scars and experience trauma. Its just that some of your scars show on the outside. As simple and obvious as that may seem, it meant the world to me to feel that even for a second, I wasn't as different as my appearance and interactions lead me to sometimes feel and believe. Needless to say, I'm working on myself but am certainly not a push over (so you preying wolf, stay away!) 

If you're interested in getting to know someone like myself and maybe hangout, shoot me a message by telling me about yourself and attach a picture of yourself. Here's some of the things I hope you're like:

Friendly, Respectful
Single, No kids, Never married
Educated, Employed, Ambitious
27-35 age **
5'9 height or taller *
Stylish/Well groomed

More About Me----> I'll send you my picture once you send yours. I'm an African American educated female, 5'10, slim build, dark toned skin, and I have a great smile. I know it may seem like I'm asking for a lot but hey why limit your hearts desire. Prayers up. :) Thats it for now...

I had posted before, but I didn't find the one I was looking for. Some guys don't know how to read or understood what I'm saying. I put down what I didn't want and, gosh, most of the replies were from guys who didn't even understand my post. 

First, I want to find a friend. Get to know him thru emails before we exchange numbers. Then if we think (if I think basically) we are what we are looking for we should meet. I'm looking for a guy that understand me. I want to have a long term relationship. But, it takes time. I'm not one to jump into a relation within weeks of knowing a person. I had only been with one other guy, and he wasn't the one for me. He and I have a daughter together and I just love that little girl more than anything. I'm a single mom I want my next relationship to be my last. I don't want to go from guy guy to guy. I'm a simple, humble, and a great person. I just want my guy to appreciate me and accept me as I am flaws and all.

My dream guy (can't say perfect lol noone is perfect )
Is a good looking, funny, and outgoing. Taller than 5'6 (I'm 5'5) romantic, with a good sense of humor. Disease and drama free. Smoking is gross I don't smoke or drink. You can be a occasional drinker I don't mind. I don't have much family here, but the one I do have I'm greatful for. I'm close to them. I eventually want to get marry and have at least 2 more kids. Hopefully, before I'm 30 if not is OK, I can dream lol. I'm a simple girl I prefer going for a walk to the park or beach. Or watch a movie or read abook. I know how to cooki enjoy eating homede food then going out to eat. I like going out once in awhile thought. If, you are interested in knowing more, of want to be friends send me a messege.

Please do not send me your numbers I'm not calling/texting. If I'm interested I will exchange numbers until then email for a few days. 

I'm not looking for one night stand. Please,dobt ask Ms if I need money, a sugar daddy,or disgusting stuff like that. I'm sure there are other posts Luke that. 

I'm a real person, a real woman. Don't waste my time or yours asking if I'm real. I'll prove it. If, you take a chance to email me is because I might had caught your attention, so please grab mine. Don't just say hi, hello, hey. Introduce yourself tell me about you. And my picture doesn't get yours. Send me yours then I'll send mine.

Now, on with my ad. I'm a 31yo AA, small BBW that is on the verge of just giving up on relationships. All I ask for is an understanding man(preference is Caucasian, open to those that are serious though) that only wants ONE woman in their life. I'm easy to get alone with and love a variety of indoor and outdoor things. I'm very affectionate, passionate, family oreinted and yes, I can cook. I don't mind if you have a kid or two, I myself have none. Open to the possibility of having one though. I won't put more than this out there. If I peak your interest a little or you want to ask me even more about me, send me an email. 

If I'm feeling your response or think you're legit enough...I'll leave you my number after first two emails.....not all that into endless emails.

Finding Love is like finding a New Job. There is an interview process and that determines whether or not if you want to move forward with them. Its hard sometimes to find that one person who will love you for who you are. Sometimes it feels like were playing Powerball and just praying that we get the numbers correct. Sometimes waiting around for Mr. Right to show up does not happen and years go by. So taking a chance and praying that I can meet a nice man is wishful.
For me I am a single mom to two kids. My kids mean the world to me. They do come first in my life. I am looking for a man that can I understand that. Family time is important. I also work full-time and enjoy my job. Im also a photographer on the side. I am ""Awake"" .In my free time I like going to the movies, karaoke, and going to the park.

It is part of human nature, a part of life that everyone is not going to like everything. Whether it is another person, a certain brand of clothing, food, etc... Everything isn't for everybody. It takes some of us a little longer to become mature enough to realize like that and how to handle it and expressing it.

I am a 34 year old African American woman who is full-figured with defined curves. Not only do I consider myself a classy, tasteful woman, I am also very sweet and pretty easy-going. So you will find yourself comfortable with me immediately and captivated by my intelligence on a variety of subjects.

I enjoy being around those that are very optimistic, and love being with gentlemen that have as big of a heart as I do. Not only should this gentleman have a very big heart but they should also be established, educated and confident. And be willing to take pressure of making heavy choices off of my shoulders and explore the finer things in life. Who wants to do any of that alone?

I'm not sure why my posts keep getting flagged. I am real! Thursday is St. Patrick's Day.

I am looking for a man who can show this BBW some love! Where are all my BBW lovers out there? I can't seem to find one lately!

I am looking for someone to date and see if it turns into more. I'm not really into a FWB situation, I'm more of a dating/relationship/one man kinda woman/hopeless romantic. Lol. :P

About me: I am 22. I'll be 23 next month. I have a business degree from UTA. I have my own car and my own place. I'm looking for someone with the same. I have (faux) red hair and tattoos. I love football. I'm a Packers fan. :)

I would prefer someone close to my age, maybe just a tad older, but 40 is definitely my cut off. I'd like an educated man who has his shit together. Race isn't a huge issue. Tattoos/beards are a major plus!

Please reply with your favorite movie in the subject line so I can weed out spam. Tell me how old you are and send a pic. I look forward to hearing from you!

I am a single mom with a few young kids and have been looking for a room mate live in situation, and I would like to do this some what quickly. I am pregnant. The problem is that i need someone who appreciates kids. We can mostly stay back in the room if it is best for u, i am very clean. I can provide for food for me and my kids. I am a good cook and am sane lol. I can keep up with the house work, make dinner and watch kids or older ones also, in exchange for rent and a few toiletries. I dont smoke, or drink, and no drugs. The kids are fairly quiet and go to bed early. I am 32 white, pregnant, and have put on some extra weight in the last three or four months. The relationship aspect is sort of conditional that we sort of hit it off so to speak. I also request physical discretion around my kids. I am looking for something long term if it works out and hopefully it does. I love the outdoors, camping, gardening, and have a goal to get myself self sustaining and able to live off the grid with in ten years lol, for a bit of background on me. Dont send me nasty pics plz. I have been staying with a friend of mine who said there simply is not enough space in his house for us, and also I find him quite intolerant for young kids which is y i said that I need someone who appreciates them.

Is anyone out here really serious? Anyone really looking for a real relationship? Yes I know where I am, but I refuse to think everyone is crazy or trying to stalk or hurt someone...although some of yall are a tadbit off. :)

I have my own everything, so I'm not out trying to get a dinner or movie, but looking for a genuine person. 

Please be gainfully employed, have your own place, and vehicle. I do like to talk and if you don't, then I'm not for you.

About me. I'm 5'5 curvy, but working on changing that. I'm 47, like going to different festivals, traveling, and just trying new things. 

I'm open to all races and even all sizes (to a certain extent), but please TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. I love a man that smells good and cares about his appearance at ALL times. You must be affectionate. If showing affection is a problem for you...I'm not your person. Also the youngest I care to go is 44. 

If you are just looking for sex, keep it moving. That's not even at the top of my list right now until I know you. 

If you are not real....please don't waste my time. I am no where close to being desperate, but I would like to find that ONE!

I also understand some may not like me, and vice versa...it's life. 

If you are serious...please send a picture and put ""SERIOUS"" and your age in the subject line. No picture and I promise I will NOT respond. Yes I will ask you your race, height, what do you do for living...I'm not shallow, but I'm not trying to waste my time nor yours.

I go to school 4 days a week but generally have the afternoon free from around noon till 2 or 4 depends on the day. I own two dogs who i do treat like they are my babies. I am not a small girl but I am dieting and working out 3 days a week to lose weight but it is a work in progress. I am the only girl so i do come off a spoiled or tomboyish. It is what it is. I enjoy museums, trying new restaurants, hiking, parks, mini golf, batting cages, live bands. Not into drinking all night because well I don't drink or smoke. I don't care if you drink but would prefer to not have a smoker. I love my friends and family and can be loyal to a fault, but once crossed your done. 

YOU: preferably taller then me - I'm 5'8. Intelligent. Some who likes to be out and about. I don't mind a night in but if I have a weekend day off I want to be out even if it is rainy. I also would like an active guy because I am starting to become more active. Not to marathon standards and I don't want to be but I wouldn't mind bike rides or long walks. I don't have a race preference but I haven't had the best of luck with Black males or country boys. at this point I want someone who won't lie to me everyday and not expect me or even become angry when I call him on it. Also they need to be looking for a future in 37 so yes I want kids and a future with one person.

Hi there! I have tried this before and well it didn't work or I wouldn't be trying again. I am looking for a FWB. Though you must be real of course you must be serious. 

So when replying place your name and eye color please.

I am into young 21- 30 guys. A bit older is not a problem. Just have a young view and well I'm into innocent looking and breakable. I don't mind a bit extra weight as I am thick.

You know I enjoy being spun around the dance floor and are man enough to take me dancing. As much as we enjoy spending time together we also enjoy our time apart as its nice to have experiences to talk about outside of us.

We keep missing each other so let's make plans to meet up so we can start our journey together. Perhaps meet over a nice glass of wine or a night out on the dance floor. I am a traditionalist and believe in letting the man take the lead.

Please have your shit together, be good looking, active / in good enough shape to keep up and looking for something long term. Im 30, educated, employed, fun, independent good girl next door but crazy in the bedroom, love being in love and all that comes with.

Hi there! I have tried this before and well it didn't work or I wouldn't be trying again. I am looking for a FWB. Though you must be real of course you must be serious. 

So when replying place your name and eye color please.

I am into young 21- 30 guys. A bit older is not a problem. Just have a young view and well I'm into innocent looking and breakable. I don't mind a bit extra weight as I am thick. Though a sweet sexy slim fit guy is what I seek with a touch of emo hipster look. Again, I'm not trying to be picking, just know what makes me hot.
You must want to want to chat. And not just about Sex, sex is great but if I wanted to just fuck I'd hit the bar.

I have recently been hurt and want a FWB that wants to give me attention and not afraid to message just to say they are thinking about me.

I like to hang out and have drinks while dancing. 

Again, when replying name and hair color. Include a pic or no reply. To receive a pic you must send one.

34 years old. 176lbs curvy, at the moment purplist hair, brown eyes. Very fun 

You must know how to kiss with passion..

Seriously guys? This is not just for sex. No need to send your dic pics ...

I think I'm just realizing that my circle is pretty small, and perhaps I should expand it. For the most part I'm pretty satisfied with my life, but obviously something is lacking or I wouldn't be scoping out cl ads. I've got kids(17 and 5), some massive home improvement projects, and what I hope will grow into a small business. I manage to stay pretty busy with a flexible schedule. I take nothing for granted in my life and celebrate even the smallest of victories. You should have seen me after my living room was painted!

I've let these things distract me from putting myself out there to meet someone. I miss flirting and getting ""thinking of you"" text messages. I miss quality hugs and being touched by someone over 5yo.. I really do want a friend more than a relationship. Hell, I don't assume I'm anyone's type. Ohh there it is--the insecurity and fear of rejection. I'm a cancer so I default to nurturing. I don't want to ""mommy"" a grown man, at the same time I'm all about bringing soup when someone is sick. 

Maybe we'll click enough to take it beyone email. What do you have to lose?

Thanks for clicking! Before you get into my post, I am currently located in San Antonio. Why am I posting in Dallas? Because I hear that Dallas has the best single men. Did I hear right? I am looking for an honest, funny, and single guy and I believe there are a lot of good ones out there, I just need to find one. I love the idea of a road trip and exploring a new city so why not throw it all into one!

I am a single white female looking for a single male for adventures and hopefully more. I am hoping to settle down and have a family (but not after the third date.) It would just be good to share the same aspirations for the future. I would prefer ages 33 -- 38ish. I am 33, college educated, drug and disease free, and sane. I have never been married and have no kids.

I am traditional in the sense that I am more focused on making my family happy than climbing the corporate ladder (not saying there is anything wrong with the corporate ladder or that you can't do both!) however I am employed and do have goals. I also have a soft spot for a take charge man as I tend to have a more submissive personality. I was raised with Christian values and hope to share those qualities. 

I drink socially but do not smoke. I enjoy camping, the beach, road trips, reading, music, and movies. I go to the gym and I am attempting to learn how to cook beyond boiling eggs and other basics. At one point I was on a kickball league and I might start that up again. I do enjoy attending sporting events.

If any of this intrigues you, I would love to hear back.

I have really bad scars from an accident I had as a child. **The photo is a picture of an ex model turned burnsurvivor named Turia Pitt. ** I read about her story and how her relationship was able to pull through the trauma of her accident. Although it's a bit of a reach for me, I am hopeful that despite the absence of the right guy, its possible for me too. 

So coupled with the outcome of my injury and growing up in a conservative household, I consider myself a bit of a late bloomer. The scars on my face are my biggest regret because as you can imagine people's stares aren't always kind. So in anticipation of eye contact, I tend to look away. Trust me, I'm working on it and it's getting better with time. 

My personality is adaptable. In many instances like work and school, I'm a social butterfly and a relatively confident person. But when it comes to social environments where I'm meeting people who aren't familiar with me and especially where dating or flirting happens, I tend to flounder and not know what to do... While this seems like a venting session, I'd like to hope there's someone who's out there who can relate and or want to get to know me, despite the obvious challenges I'm getting over.

I have made some strides in the dating area, I guess. The other day I met someone I was chatting with from tinder and it went fine. We met once after a few days and then another time after a few weeks of talking. I just don't think it's going anywhere because subtle things indicated that he didn't respect me or my time... I'll leave it at that. But for some reason a few days after the second meet up we just stopped checking in. Despite that upset, I did learn through that experience that in spite of feeling singled out and unlovable; I realized how many, if not all people sometimes feel that way. 

Simply put by a bar buddy I met at the Continental Dinner while waiting forty-five minutes for my date to arrive (oops, I said I wouldn't get into that), the buddy said we all have scars and experience trauma. Its just that some of your scars show on the outside. As simple and obvious as that may seem, it meant the world to me to feel that even for a second, I wasn't as different as my appearance and interactions lead me to sometimes feel and believe. Needless to say, I'm working on myself but am certainly not a push over (so you preying wolf, stay away!) 

If you're interested in getting to know someone like myself and maybe hangout, shoot me a message by telling me about yourself and attach a picture of yourself. Here's some of the things I hope you're like:

Friendly, Respectful
Single, No kids, Never married
Educated, Employed, Ambitious

5'9 height or taller *

I had posted before, but I didn't find the one I was looking for. Some guys don't know how to read or understood what I'm saying. I put down what I didn't want and, gosh, most of the replies were from guys who didn't even understand my post. 

First, I want to find a friend. Get to know him thru emails before we exchange numbers. Then if we think (if I think basically) we are what we are looking for we should meet. I'm looking for a guy that understand me. I want to have a long term relationship. But, it takes time. I'm not one to jump into a relation within weeks of knowing a person. I had only been with one other guy, and he wasn't the one for me. He and I have a daughter together and I just love that little girl more than anything. I'm a single mom I want my next relationship to be my last. I don't want to go from guy guy to guy. I'm a simple, humble, and a great person. I just want my guy to appreciate me and accept me as I am flaws and all.

My dream guy (can't say perfect lol noone is perfect )
Is a good looking, funny, and outgoing. Taller than 5'6 (I'm 5'5) romantic, with a good sense of humor. Disease and drama free. Smoking is gross I don't smoke or drink. You can be a occasional drinker I don't mind. I don't have much family here, but the one I do have I'm greatful for. I'm close to them. I eventually want to get marry and have at least 2 more kids. Hopefully, before I'm 30 if not is OK, I can dream lol. I'm a simple girl I prefer going for a walk to the park or beach. Or watch a movie or read abook. I know how to cooki enjoy eating homede food then going out to eat. I like going out once in awhile thought. If, you are interested in knowing more, of want to be friends send me a messege.

Please do not send me your numbers I'm not calling/texting. If I'm interested I will exchange numbers until then email for a few days. 

I'm not looking for one night stand. Please,dobt ask Ms if I need money, a sugar daddy,or disgusting stuff like that. I'm sure there are other posts Luke that. 

I'm a real person, a real woman. Don't waste my time or yours asking if I'm real. I'll prove it. If, you take a chance to email me is because I might had caught your attention, so please grab mine. Don't just say hi, hello, hey. Introduce yourself tell me about you. And my picture doesn't get yours. Send me yours then I'll send mine.

Finding Love is like finding a New Job. There is an interview process and that determines whether or not if you want to move forward with them. Its hard sometimes to find that one person who will love you for who you are. Sometimes it feels like were playing Powerball and just praying that we get the numbers correct. Sometimes waiting around for Mr. Right to show up does not happen and years go by. So taking a chance and praying that I can meet a nice man is wishful.
For me I am a single mom to two kids. My kids mean the world to me. They do come first in my life. I am looking for a man that can I understand that. Family time is important. I also work full-time and enjoy my job. Im also a photographer on the side. I am ""Awake"" .In my free time I like going to the movies, karaoke, and going to the park.

It is part of human nature, a part of life that everyone is not going to like everything. Whether it is another person, a certain brand of clothing, food, etc... Everything isn't for everybody. It takes some of us a little longer to become mature enough to realize like that and how to handle it and expressing it.

I am a 34 year old African American woman who is full-figured with defined curves. Not only do I consider myself a classy, tasteful woman, I am also very sweet and pretty easy-going. So you will find yourself comfortable with me immediately and captivated by my intelligence on a variety of subjects.

I enjoy being around those that are very optimistic, and love being with gentlemen that have as big of a heart as I do. Not only should this gentleman have a very big heart but they should also be established, educated and confident. And be willing to take pressure of making heavy choices off of my shoulders and explore the finer things in life. Who wants to do any of that alone?

I'm not sure why my posts keep getting flagged. I am real! Thursday is St. Patrick's Day.

I am looking for a man who can show this BBW some love! Where are all my BBW lovers out there? I can't seem to find one lately!

I am looking for someone to date and see if it turns into more. I'm not really into a FWB situation, I'm more of a dating/relationship/one man kinda woman/hopeless romantic. Lol. :P

About me: I am 22. I'll be 23 next month. I have a business degree from UTA. I have my own car and my own place. I'm looking for someone with the same. I have (faux) red hair and tattoos. I love football. I'm a Packers fan. :)

I would prefer someone close to my age, maybe just a tad older, but 40 is definitely my cut off. I'd like an educated man who has his shit together. Race isn't a huge issue. Tattoos/beards are a major plus!

Please reply with your favorite movie in the subject line so I can weed out spam. Tell me how old you are and send a pic. I look forward to hearing from you!

I am a single mom with a few young kids and have been looking for a room mate live in situation, and I would like to do this some what quickly. I am pregnant. The problem is that i need someone who appreciates kids. We can mostly stay back in the room if it is best for u, i am very clean. I can provide for food for me and my kids. I am a good cook and am sane lol. I can keep up with the house work, make dinner and watch kids or older ones also, in exchange for rent and a few toiletries. I dont smoke, or drink, and no drugs. The kids are fairly quiet and go to bed early. I am 32 white, pregnant, and have put on some extra weight in the last three or four months. The relationship aspect is sort of conditional that we sort of hit it off so to speak. I also request physical discretion around my kids. I am looking for something long term if it works out and hopefully it does. I love the outdoors, camping, gardening, and have a goal to get myself self sustaining and able to live off the grid with in ten years lol, for a bit of background on me. Dont send me nasty pics plz. I have been staying with a friend of mine who said there simply is not enough space in his house for us, and also I find him quite intolerant for young kids which is y i said that I need someone who appreciates them.

Ok well this worked for my brother maybe it will work for me. It was a failure once before but that is on him for lying. 
ME: 37 yr old , white woman from Arlington. I work as a baker so I get up early (around 3AM) 4 - 5 days a week so I got to be 4-5 days a week around 730 or 8pm. I go to school 4 days a week but generally have the afternoon free from around noon till 2 or 4 depends on the day. I own two dogs who i do treat like they are my babies. I am not a small girl but I am dieting and working out 3 days a week to lose weight but it is a work in progress. I am the only girl so i do come off a spoiled or tomboyish. It is what it is. I enjoy museums, trying new restaurants, hiking, parks, mini golf, batting cages, live bands. Not into drinking all night because well I don't drink or smoke. I don't care if you drink but would prefer to not have a smoker. I love my friends and family and can be loyal to a fault, but once crossed your done. 

YOU: preferably taller then me - I'm 5'8. Intelligent. Some who likes to be out and about. I don't mind a night in but if I have a weekend day off I want to be out even if it is rainy. I also would like an active guy because I am starting to become more active. Not to marathon standards and I don't want to be but I wouldn't mind bike rides or long walks. I don't have a race preference but I haven't had the best of luck with Black males or country boys. at this point I want someone who won't lie to me everyday and not expect me or even become angry when I call him on it. Also they need to be looking for a future in 37 so yes I want kids and a future with one person.

Weekday evenings are sometimes spent at the dog park or walking her along the Trinity ... would be nice if our dogs got along ... writing .. reading .. surfing the net .. laying back and watching the clouds turn colors.

Days are filled with errands, appointments, taking care of my body and soul, making a living, making a life .. I have a beautiful new bicycle but have never taken her out for a spin .. maybe we could go riding together .. the garden gets lots of attention this time of year .. planting and playing in the dirt.

I often wonder if I was born in thr wrong generation... Things are no longer made with quality or built to last, and that goes for people too. Women have learned to settle and men have learned to accept it. 

I come to Craigslist because, as an attractive young women, I still have difficulty with dating. Men don't approach me. And if they do, they ask for my Snapchat or Kik, not my number. They ask When I would like to come over, not plan a date. Because all those things are now ""privilages."" A man no longer has patience to court a woman, so he goes for another woman and wonders why she lacks the quality he expects.

I'm past the fwb only thing but I'm not going to drag anyone to Vegas to get married either. I'm not looking to play any games. I would love to meet one great guy to connect with. I even like watching some sports, lol. My age preference is 35 to about 40. Please add your first name in the subject line and tell me a little about yourself in your reply. Thank you for reading.

Ok so here it goes... I am a single 31 year old woman, very attractive. I have a wonderful life with a great career, just looking for someone to share it with. Not looking for a hook up partner. Though also not looking to rush into things.

Ideally I would love to meet someone who I really enjoy conversing with and being around, then go from there. Just a natural progression. I am a very down to earth and low maintenance person. I love the outdoors, reading, playing golf and riding my road bike.

Hey there!

So usually I wouldn't even think to post on craigslist, unless I wanted some kind of excitement in my life so I figured why not? We only live once right? 

A little bit about me: I'm a chubby, pretty Hispanic young woman who enjoys professional wrestling and The Walking Dead. I'm fairly intelligent about some subjects (like animals OMFG who doesn't love animals?) and others not so much (politics are interesting but they do bore me). I currently do work, but I'm at a point in my life I want to make a career out of the place I'm working at and not simply just work there just to work there, so I am looking for other jobs at the moment as well. I was born and raised in good old Texas, and pretty much have the kind, friendly Texan attitude everyone is installed with. I'm shy when you first get to know me, but after I get comfortable I can be wild, random and pretty outgoing. :) I like just about every type of music out there, but my all time favorites have to be Bon Jovi and Def Leppard. Classic rock is the bomb case closed! 

I am a straight edge Christian, but don't let the title fool you. I'm not going to thump the Bible over your head or try to ""save"" you, nor am I going to judge you because you prefer to drink and smoke weed or do drugs. Personally, I could really care less who people believe in or what they do, because ultimately what you do in life is...well your business. I have friends who aren't Christians, who drink, who smoke, who've done some hardcore shit, and even though I can give an opinion I still respect everyone's decision to do what they want. The only things I ask is that you give me the same respect, and don't pressure me to do anything. I don't mind people drinking in front of me or even casually smoking a cigar or cigarette, but smoking weed or doing drugs in front of me is something I won't tolerate. 

Now that you have some kind of sense about me, let me explain my situation: Currently I am in a relationship, but there's something missing. My boyfriend is less affectionate and less caring than he originally was with me, and we are struggling. We both don't want to break up with each other, but there's a lot of clashing between us. I came down to the fact I NEED a distraction. Someone to sweep me off my feet, and just accept me for me. Be there for me not only physically, but mentally and emotionally. 

Do I want a side relationship? Yes. Do I want a side boyfriend on the down low? Yes. That is the kind of distraction I need, and possibly it may even help me rekindle my relationship now. Honestly, I'm looking for, in lack of better words, a best guy friend. Somebody I can laugh with, hang out with, go to for advice, snuggle with, make out with, and maybe even have sex with. I do want some kind of connection, not a ""lets fuck and leave"" situation. I would like to be spoiled every now and then by this best guy friend, but let's be clear I'm not looking for a sugar daddy.

I'm interested in men older than me (I am 22, 23 in April), and as long as you're good looking and/or fairly interesting I have no age limit. I will admit I'm very attracted to white men who are taller than me (I'm 5'2"") and have either an athletic or stocky built (but generally body type doesn't matter to me as long as you're healthy and carry yourself well). 

If you've made it this far and seem pretty interested definitely send me an email! Let's get to know each other and see where it goes! Put you're favorite animal in the subject line so I can weed out the spam. PLEASE INCLUDE A PIC IN YOUR REPLY. And I will send one back in return. I'm real, Wrestlemania 32 is coming to Dallas and no robot can say that :P

I realize this is in the relationship section. But before we can become bedroom partners we must meet and become friends. A meeting for me so that I can see who you are. That will tell me a lot. I don't want to do endless emails with out meeting first. Loneliness isn't fun and I've been doing it for a long while. My goal with this add is to find that special someone that wants to enjoy life and likes adventure. I am a widowed senior lady living in Roundup. The walls don't do conversation very well and the 3 cats and 2 dogs have their own language that I don't understand very well. LOL I am a clean lady and keep a clean house minus a little dog and cat hair. LOL I love to be outdoors weather permitting, fishing and hunting, yard work what ever needs attention. I also enjoy the indoors with that very special someone, cuddling, laughing, general conversation. Laughter makes for a fun day. There is no alcohol or drugs in my home and smoking is done on the porch. I own my home and 2 vehicles. They aren't much but they are mine. I am looking into selling out and moving to a warmer climate because I'm tired of fighting the cold and snow alone. It will take someone very special to change my mind. Are you that someone? If so you will need to convince me. 
In your response please put your age and a recent picture. Put Fun in the subject line so I can find it when it goes to my spam folder. No picture no reply. An informative reply will get my attention. No 1 liners. I will send a picture back. Thank you for reading this and have a wonderful day.

Hello fellas. 

I am a 29 y/o woman looking to meet that special man. I'm originally from the Inland Empire, and have been living in LA for about 4 years now. 

About me. I'm in school. My major is Administration of Justice. I love love discussing America's CJ System with those who also find it interesting and have a great respect for law enforcement. 
I'm a very outgoing, bubbly gal. I love to make people laugh and i'm a prankster, so if we ever meet, consider yourself warned. 
I like to stay active. Power walking and yoga are my first love in terms of physical activity. I'm a big kid at heart so I like going to places like Sky Zone. It's so much fun. I'm a foodie, so I like going to restaurants. Absolutely no fast food. Yuck. 
Hmm. I don't wanna give too much away. 

I like men who are respectful, has a good sense of humor. Romantic, a man of faith. I like men my age. Tall and in shape. 

So, if you like my post, let's chat and get to know each other. 
Please reply with age and pic.

Basics you need to know about me. I am new to the area, I am looking for something serious, I am 20, I am a BBW, I have a corny sense of humor, I don't drive and I have no children. I am very smart and not ghetto at all. 

I do have a thing for beards, muscles,tattoos, nice hair, tall guys, and guys who are thin to thick build(not bigger than me). I do prefer you to be 21-35. If you are older than 25 ask yourself if you're appealing to a 20 year old who knows what she wants before you reply. I absolutely love smart men! That's the best characteristic you could have besides a good sense of humor and good heart. I am southern so I do still believe in chivalry. I guess I'm old at heart lol 

I am still growing as a person so I have a wide variety of interests. Please be close to Denton. I'm not looking for a email relationship, I want to go on actual dates and get to know you. I'm also not looking for hookups,Fwb, or a Netflix and chill type of situation. So Don't ask.

If you're interested send a picture and tell me a little about you.

Let's go out on the town today or stay in and enjoy each other... I want someone to wake up next to and sip tea smiling from ear to ear...My curiosity has driven me thus far... I want to date a white man that is fit and healthy because I value someone who works out and eats clean. I am thick maybe even some would consider me a bbw (but who looks amazing thick and is in a sports illustrated cover this year?) I am mixed race Jamaican and Hawaiian I love bright eyes and blonde hair (but hey who can be picky here?). I also don't mind anyone with a/uno/one kid because I have one as well and value Great parenting. Heck that means more activities! I consider myself a catch I'm attractive, fit (hwp), I have a career, a car (paid off), my own place, no debt, I take care of myself hygiene wise and the way I dress. I like to cook for my man and be a confidant but not smoother a guy... I'm a hopeless romantic and allow past relationships to be a tool to making my ultimate relationship successful. I guess I'm unapproachable when I do go out?? or maybe just too engrossed in my own vibe lol. But either or I am not truly enjoying my singleness (some days are great some suck) so here's a shot in the dark!! All I ask is you be goal oriented and attractive also above 6'0 if possible I can't deal with a short guy and I'm pretty short. They say cuffing season is over I say f*ck that let's get corny and ride the Ferris wheel then stare at a beautiful view at Kerry park :-) ( hopeless romantic)..

Hey guys!! I'm kinda just writing this because I feel like my social life has hit a plateau. I don't feel like I'm meeting worth while guys when I go out (If that makes sense). Things just always kind of fizzle out before anything starts.So I thought I'd try CL for some texting buddies to see where things go...

and hanging out with fun people. I like to think that that I'm bubbly, energetic, and pretty fluent in sarcasm. I have a big family and they're my world. :D

That's me in an incredibly boring nutshell and if you've made it this far I guess you're wondering what I'm looking for in you. I think really I'm just looking for a man that knows how to hold a conversation, who's witty and a great sense of humor wouldn't hurt either.;) I'm really looking for someone 22-30 ish years old.

I'm definitely not looking for sex, so if that's what you're looking for, I apologize you've read this far. I'm really awkwardly bad at these kinds of things, but I hope I made a good first impression on someone! I'm just gonna leave this here because I have no idea what else to say lol

Hello CL,

I'm a single mom looking for a friend to hang out with, that has the potential to become more later on. 

First, let me tell you a little bit more about myself:

•	I'm 22, but I've been told I'm very mature for my age. Unfortunately, I'm still undecided when it comes to knowing what I want out of a relationship. I DO know that I'm NOT looking for a fwb, a hook up, or anything that involves meaningless sex.
•	I've only been in a couple relationships (serious or otherwise), due to the simple reason that I haven't been looking. 
•	I'm not fat, but I'm not skinny either. I'm more pudgy than anything. There are times I diet and times I don't. Same thing with exercise. I don't consider myself ugly or beautiful. You can judge for yourself. (Pic4pic)
•	I enjoy reading and writing original stories. I'm hoping to attend college soon so I can major in English and maybe get a degree in child care too.
•	I sometimes watch popular tv shows (Doctor Who, Once Upon A Time, Criminal Minds, etc), as well as anime (Naruto, Attack on Titan, etc). Occasionally, I'll play video games too (Legend of Zelda, Kingdom Hearts, Mortal Combat, etc). Keyword: sometimes.

Now let me give you a list of preferences (because we all have them). I'm looking for someone:

•	Between the ages of 22-29.
•	Who has their own car and a job. (I do not have a place of my own because I'm helping my recently divorced mom take care of my younger siblings. So it'd be really nice if you had your own place so that we could have the option of hanging out somewhere private.)
•	Mature, respectful, and patient. (No jerks please.)
•	Not obese. (I'm not particularly picky, but I have my limits.)
•	Light complected (not racist; just a preference.)
•	Who is okay with me being a mom first. I have a 3 year old son that comes before everything else in my life. Even if we were to start a serious relationship, my son would always be first.

I think I've finished ranting. If you're interested, e-mail me a current picture and more about yourself. Don't be discouraged if I don't reply right away. My working and sleeping schedule can be a bit chaotic since I work the graveyard shift sometimes.

Please put your name and age as the subject line.

What do we really think we can find here on CL? Do we think we will fill the needs that we have? Is it just a fantasy? Is it the lust that is not in our marriages anymore? I am honestly not entirely sure what I expect to find here on CL. It would be nice to find someone to share a quality, emotional, and passionate friendship with, but how does that start on the internet? It seems almost impossible to weed through it all and find someone who matches your desires. 

I want to experience passion with a man again. I want to lust after you and for you to lust after me. I want to daydream about you, the smell of your hair, the sparkle in your eyes, the taste of you, the feel of you, the warmth of your body. 

While this is something I would not base solely on looks, I think there should be a match between both people. I would like to find someone similar to myself who is athletic, slim and attractive. I would also like to find someone who is smart, honest, fun, humorous, sexy and not afraid to share.

My name is Felicia . I honestly looking for someone to have a good time with. Life is too short to be arguing and playing games. I want honesty from the start. We all have something we have gone through I have see and heard everything out there. My thing is the truth is going to come out any ways. You should be with someone because you love them not because they are perfect. If your looking for perfection youll never find it. My strengths are that I am a family person, I love animals and I love singing . I love cooking too only because its my hobby . when I am in a relationship I like to make my man feel loved in welcomed. If its cooking for you, or giving you a back rub when you come in from work or just leaving you alone so you can have some free time I am cool with it. I think my weakness is that I can be silent at time and hard to read. But if you have question ill always answer. I had arguing . if there's a problem lets get it out and the open and resolve it. I am not going to keep going over the same issues again and again. So anyways that me in a nutshell. I do want a relationship . but one that's build off of mutual trust.

Kinda in a funk
Hey guys!! I'm kinda just writing this because I feel like my social life has hit a plateau. I don't feel like I'm meeting worth while guys when I go out (If that makes sense). Things just always kind of fizzle out before anything starts.So I thought I'd try CL for some texting buddies to see where things go...

Annnywaayss enough about that! I'm 22 and a full time student. I love music, CONCERTS, reading, movies
and hanging out with fun people. I like to think that that I'm bubbly, energetic, and pretty fluent in sarcasm. I have a big family and they're my world. :D

That's me in an incredibly boring nutshell and if you've made it this far I guess you're wondering what I'm looking for in you. I think really I'm just looking for a man that knows how to hold a conversation, who's witty and a great sense of humor wouldn't hurt either.;) I'm really looking for someone 22-30 ish years old.

I'm definitely not looking for sex, so if that's what you're looking for, I apologize you've read this far. I'm really awkwardly bad at these kinds of things, but I hope I made a good first impression on someone! I'm just gonna leave this here because I have no idea what else to say lol

I am NOT a one-night stand! 

I am more than the physical attraction.

I am a woman, only seeking an actual man. No boys as I have NO patience to teach. Not interested in women. Sorry, just doesn't do anything for me. 

Obviously, one must find the wrapping appealing in order to seek the substance within...and I have substance. I care for the right food intake and drink tea or water regularly. Put effort into my physical appearance so I am only interested in a man who does the same. I will need to weed out the ""uninvited"" so the right man will surface.

Lol...I am not rotund nor am I a twig. I lift to tone for a lean build and flexibility to age gracefully.

I do my part to eat healthy and only interested in the same. 

I'm only interested in one man.

No female or others. 
No phishy business. 


Best of luck to everyone.

Hi there! I have tried this before and well it didn't work or I wouldn't be trying again. I am looking for a FWB. Though you must be real of course you must be serious. 

So when replying place your name and eye color please.

I am into young 21- 30 guys. A bit older is not a problem. Just have a young view and well I'm into innocent looking and breakable. I don't mind a bit extra weight as I am thick. Though a sweet sexy white slim fit guy is what I seek with a touch of emo hipster look. Again, I'm not trying to be picky, just know what makes me hot.
You must want to want to chat. And not just about Sex, sex is great but if I wanted to just fuck I'd hit the bar.

I have recently been hurt and want a FWB that wants to give me attention and not afraid to message just to say they are thinking about me.

I like to hang out and have drinks while dancing. 

Again, when replying name and something about yourself. Also your definition of fwb... I am not looking to be a back up.. Include a pic or no reply. To receive a pic you must send one.

34 years old. 176lbs curvy, at the moment purplist hair, brown eyes. Very fun 

You must know how to kiss with passion..

Hello CL,

I'm a single mom looking for someone to hang out with, that has the potential to become more later on. 

First, let me tell you a little bit more about myself:

•	I'm 22, but I've been told I'm very mature for my age. Unfortunately, I'm still undecided when it comes to knowing what I want out of a relationship. I DO know that I'm NOT looking for a fwb, a hook up, or anything that involves meaningless sex.
•	I've only been in a couple relationships (serious or otherwise), due to the simple reason that I haven't been looking. 
•	I'm not fat, but I'm not skinny either. There are times I diet and times I don't. Same thing with exercise. I don't consider myself ugly or beautiful. You can judge for yourself. (Pic4pic)
•	I enjoy reading and writing original stories. I'm hoping to attend college soon so I can major in English and maybe get a degree in child care too. Right now, I'm a part-time waitress at a family-friendly restaurant.
•	I sometimes watch popular tv shows (Doctor Who, Once Upon A Time, Criminal Minds, etc), as well as anime (Naruto, Attack on Titan, etc). Occasionally, I'll play video games too (Legend of Zelda, Kingdom Hearts, Mortal Combat, etc).

Now let me give you a list of preferences (because we all have them). I'm looking for someone:

•	Between the ages of 22-29.
•	Who has their own car and a job. (I do not have a place of my own because I'm helping my recently divorced mom take care of my younger siblings. So it'd be really nice if you had your own place so that we could have the option of hanging out somewhere private.)
•	Mature, respectful, and patient. (No jerks please.)
•	Not obese. (I'm not particularly picky, but I have my limits.)
•	Light complected (just a preference.)
•	Who is okay with me being a mom first. I have a 3 year old son that comes before everything else in my life. Even if we were to start a serious relationship, my son would always be first.

I think I've finished ranting. If you're interested, e-mail me a current picture and more about yourself. Don't be discouraged if I don't reply right away. My working and sleeping schedule can be a bit chaotic since I work the graveyard shift sometimes.

The words speak to my heart, stirring the passion in my soul. The countless dance that my mind knows so well. Oh love, how you make a person fall hard, without a single thought. But it's a dance you never can stop dancing, without completely giving up. One we all know has pain, ache, joy , passion, the whole universe in one minute to hell the next. Watching other couples learn moves and yearning for the same. But even when the music ends you look around for that one connection... For the one that makes words go straight to your heart, and the passion stir in your soul.

Title says it all, really. I have an extra ticket for The Cure on May 15th and would like to go with a cute boy that I can maybe/maybe not make out with. If I had a ""type"" it would be emotionally crippled lanky guys with minor to middling drinking problems. I assure you that you're not the only one. I like 80s new wave, horror movies, alcohol, and being glib.

This would be, like, a date so I'm not charging anything for the ticket, but I would not object if you decided to buy me a few Whiskey Sours. Hint: I can drink a lot of Whiskey Sours. Attached are pictures of me. Turnabout is fair play so I'd like to know what you look like as well. Don't make me ask, that makes me feel like a creepo. Also, no pictures of your package unless you want my gay bff sending you pictures of his. 

Put your favorite Cure song in the subject line* if you want me to actually read your email. Otherwise it goes right in the trash because I expect to get a lot of creepy, gross messages because this is the internet and we can't have nice things ever.

Ever just look up at the stars and make a wish? Then that gentle breeze comes by as it takes that wish all the way up to the moon. How the stars read your heart, and the moon knows your thoughts. Together they join in the sky and become one. Then fate happens and life starts anew when the sun comes up. The magic of life... I know what my heart is telling the stars, and what my mind is telling the moon, and I know the one I'm looking for hears this in the night; because it's what his heart and mind are telling them also. But maybe time isn't on our side, or fate just knows better. So where oh where are you? When will it be our time? Our fate? Someone to sing to even if it's off key? Someone to be a shoulder to cry on because we feel each other's pain? The smile of mornings, and nights. The popcorn fights, and quick movie draws.... I'll be waiting until fate intervenes. Because we don't find love, but it finds us.

Hello :> This isn't very easy to say, but I'm already 24 years old and have never had a long term relationship with anyone 3D! I'm too embarrassed to try an online dating site (what if someone I know finds me?!) so I'm gonna start with this. 

Um, I'm not exactly sure what to put in here...I'm not even really sure what I'm looking for...I recently disconnected with a lot of my real life friends, so I guess I'm a little lonely, haha. I really like anime and video games, so if you like them, too, I think it would be really fun to maybe talk a little and see if we would be a good match!

I'm not talking about marriage or anything like that, haha, and it would be asking too much to be looking for some hardcore commitment, so maybe we can just start as friends? I use LINE a lot, so if you have a LINE account then we can talk a lot!

As far as looks goes, I don't think I'm too bad looking, but I am a bit overweight...Not like 300 lbs or anything but I'm not really a super tiny girl either...It's not that I don't like taking care of myself, but I was irresponsible with my eating when I was younger and it's biting me in the butt DX But if you can get past that then I'm sure I can get over any flaws you think you have too!

Ahh, this is getting a bit long ;A; I don't know what I'm expecting from this, but if you're even a bit curious then please respond! If you send me a picture I'll send you one back (and if you're secretly someone I know I won't say a thing!) Thank you for taking the time to read this! Hope to hear from someone soon!

Im a very estudious person. I enjoy learning and bettering myself more than anything.If you are a non learner today is as good as you'll ever be. I plan to go to collage soon. I currently prepare taxes as my job. I do have a product and 3 books im working on.

Transparency and devotion are musts in a relationship. Losing the argument and not the person. Sharing life with someone usually means to master compromise. Passion and honesty leading to building a family even without children would be fine.

I am only interested in a African American man preferably over 40-57 ive set this site to 30 just incase. Im not a fwb candidate, i am marriage minded. 

I love animals of all types , gardening , reading , making ministry style slide shows. Biking, skating i enjoy going out but more i enjoy a loving evening at home.

If i sound like someone youd be intetested in meeting please send me a message. 
Thanks for reading.

Hello CL,

I'm a single mom looking for a friend to hang out with, that has the potential to become more later on. 

First, let me tell you a little bit more about myself:

•	I'm 22, but I've been told I'm very mature for my age. Unfortunately, I'm still undecided when it comes to knowing what I want out of a relationship. I DO know that I'm NOT looking for a fwb, a hook up, or anything that involves meaningless sex.
•	I've only been in a couple relationships (serious or otherwise), due to the simple reason that I haven't been looking. 
•	I'm not fat, but I'm not skinny either. I'm more pudgy than anything. There are times I diet and times I don't. Same thing with exercise. I don't consider myself ugly or beautiful. You can judge for yourself. (Pic4pic)
•	I enjoy reading and writing original stories. I'm hoping to attend college soon so I can major in English and maybe get a degree in child care too.
•	I sometimes watch popular tv shows (Doctor Who, Once Upon A Time, Criminal Minds, etc), as well as anime (Naruto, Attack on Titan, etc). Occasionally, I'll play video games too (Legend of Zelda, Kingdom Hearts, Mortal Combat, etc). Keyword: sometimes.

Now let me give you a list of preferences (because we all have them). I'm looking for someone:

•	Between the ages of 22-29.
•	Who has their own car and a job. (I do not have a place of my own because I'm helping my recently divorced mom take care of my younger siblings. So it'd be really nice if you had your own place so that we could have the option of hanging out somewhere private.)
•	Mature, respectful, and patient. (No jerks please.)
•	Not obese. (I'm not particularly picky, but I have my limits.)
•	Light complected (not racist; just a preference.)
•	Who is okay with me being a mom first. I have a 3 year old son that comes before everything else in my life. Even if we were to start a serious relationship, my son would always be first.

I think I've finished ranting. If you're interested, e-mail me a current picture and more about yourself. Don't be discouraged if I don't reply right away. My working and sleeping schedule can be a bit chaotic since I work the graveyard shift sometimes.

Please put your name and age as the subject line.

Each coin has two sides. One for you and the other for me. If only it was as easy to find love as it is to find discarded coins.

I'm kinda short...ah who am I kidding..I'm really short lol. I would love a tall guy who can pick me up or give me a piggy back ride. 

I'm very playful and affectionate with the right one. Oh did I mention I could cook?! Also from the country originally so I love the outdoors in the springtime. 

Hmmm too much about me to list so if you have any other questions I'd love to hear them as long as they aren't crude. Let's keep it classy gentlemen. BTW race is unimportant as I usually date outside of mine. But please be drug and disease free and between the ages of 34-49

I think I'm just realizing that my circle is pretty small, and perhaps I should expand it. For the most part I'm pretty satisfied with my life, but obviously something is lacking or I wouldn't be scoping out cl ads. I've got kids(17 and 5), some massive home improvement projects, and what I hope will grow into a small business. I manage to stay pretty busy with a flexible schedule. I take nothing for granted in my life and celebrate even the smallest of victories. You should have seen me after my living room was painted!

I've let these things distract me from putting myself out there to meet someone. I miss flirting and getting ""thinking of you"" text messages. I miss quality hugs and being touched by someone over 5yo.. I really do want a friend more than a relationship. Hell, I don't assume I'm anyone's type. Ohh there it is--the insecurity and fear of rejection. I'm a cancer so I default to nurturing. I don't want to ""mommy"" a grown man, at the same time I'm all about bringing soup when someone is sick. 

Maybe we'll click enough to take it beyone email. What do you have to lose?

Thanks for clicking! Before you get into my post, I am currently located in San Antonio. Why am I posting in Dallas? Because I hear that Dallas has the best single men. Did I hear right? I am looking for an honest, funny, and single guy and I believe there are a lot of good ones out there, I just need to find one. I love the idea of a road trip and exploring a new city so why not throw it all into one!

I am a single white female looking for a single male for adventures and hopefully more. I am hoping to settle down and have a family (but not after the third date.) It would just be good to share the same aspirations for the future. I would prefer ages 33 -- 38ish. I am 33, college educated, drug and disease free, and sane. I have never been married and have no kids.

I am traditional in the sense that I am more focused on making my family happy than climbing the corporate ladder (not saying there is anything wrong with the corporate ladder or that you can't do both!) however I am employed and do have goals. I also have a soft spot for a take charge man as I tend to have a more submissive personality. I was raised with Christian values and hope to share those qualities. 

I drink socially but do not smoke. I enjoy camping, the beach, road trips, reading, music, and movies. I go to the gym and I am attempting to learn how to cook beyond boiling eggs and other basics. At one point I was on a kickball league and I might start that up again. I do enjoy attending sporting events.

I am unfortunately blessed with this lovely gift. It makes dating difficult and it's gets old being rejected by people for something I didn't get a choice in. At least I'm honest. Any way! About me... I work full time, own a house, nice car, have my life together. I would like to find an attractive man to become part of my life. I'm stubborn, a smartass, playful, honest, hard to handle I guess you could say bc I am highly opinionated. I'm also picky. I won't date smokers, drug users- that's includes pot. I don't drink but don't mind if you do as long as it's not excessive. I'm short, tattooed, thick/curvy, fairly short dark hair, blue eyes. Attractive. Would like to find a tall, attractive, tattooed- but not a must, man with a stable job, living situation, and who wants something More than a FWB. I want a connection! Thank you for reading, if you feel you are what I'm looking for.. Please reply. Thank you

What am I doing here? I have absolutely no idea, and I am sure you are wondering the same of yourself. I know the chances are slim to not even in my dreams that I could possibly meet you here, but just on that chance.... 

I am, well, we'll get to that eventually, first alittle about me. I am 26 years old, 5'7ish long brown hair, icy blue eyes. I am lost somewhere between curves and bbw, although don't let that fool you, I am in love with my body.

Still with me? Okay. I am an intelligent woman. I have a job of which love and activities I enjoy. Among the top are art, football, gaming, rock music and reading. 

Bored yet? These are parts of my vanilla life, my shell in which everyone sees.

Underneath this exterior is a desire. One of which needs to submit. To let go and be myself, the true me, I cant share with the world.

I am in need of a Dominant man in my life, one who cares about me and is not afraid to put me in my place. Fair warning now, this will not be easy and I am not a pushover. I have a mind and nature of my own, and sometimes she will take some hushing to get me to where I need to be. I can be rambuctious and bratty and a bit of an LG. However my deepest desire is still overall to be submissive. 

I have had my share of this type of relationship at different levels, and I can tell you now that I have had my fun, but I'm ready for real, I'm in this for the long haul. I am not looking for a scene or hookup. I am looking for a man I can learn to trust and get to know who is willing to learn my ways and shape who I need to be in his image.

So who could this man possibly be? I know what I want and I am willing to wait it out. Patience is everything. I need a tall handsome alpha type. Broad. Strong. Think linebacker. I grew up with brothers and a beast of a father, I can't imagine myself with a man who couldn't beat me at a wrestling match. Hehehe. He is an alpha type with a mind of his own. Nothing turns me on like a well kept beard and a suit! He carries himself proudly, but has a soft side too that not everyone can see. He knows what he wants and when he wants it. He is stern and aggressive but isnt afraid to take on the Daddy dynamic from time to time. But most importantly he needs a heart. I can not live without emotion. I have tried and failed at D/s relationships that lack compassion. I am wired differently than most. I have an intellect driven by the emotions of everything around me, and a Dominant who cannot feel or project feeling will not be able to possess me. 

A few helpful hints: 

I do not date younger than me, nor much older than 40. Please do not bother, I will not budge on this. I prefer white men, again just a preference. I also will not be submitting to you today, tomorrow or the next. This is going to take time so don't come at me with your domly pants on. Be respectful please and I will do the same. I will not meet you or give you my number right out the gate. I have had my share of experiences with this in the past so I would like to at least get to know you for a bit online whether it be kik or email. This is not a game to me, I am simply trying to protect myself. Please send a picture and a description of yourself and I will delve further into this dynamic with you if I think we may be compatible.

Beautiful Young Ebony Experienced Domme/ Not a professional Dominatrix looking for a TPE relationship with a sub/slave beta White Male. I'm EXTREMELY strict and demanding! I don't condone nor do I allow bullshit. You should come correct and in your proper place, or not at all! I've had subs already trained as well as ""newbies"" and while I enjoyed training the BDSM newcomers, I'd like MY slave to already be experienced. I've also turned some ""Dominant Men"" into the submissive males they always knew they were, just never finding the one capable of bring it out of them. There are MANY things I enjoy and I'm experienced in with a few being Domination, Humiliation, Facesitting/Queening, Snowballing, Toys, Pegging, Collar and leash, Financial Domination, Body worshiping, Spankings, Pet Play, Caging, Cum Control, Chastity, Bondage/ restraints, Obedience training, Orgasm denial
Sensory deprivation, Hypnosis and more. A lot of people have the subs/slave lifestyle confused on what they see in porn! Being a sub/slave is NOT solely focused on you, sex and what YOU get out of it! It's about your Dommes' pleasure, happiness, desires and her wants!
I'm not looking for ''play/pay sessions"". I will have a TPE-Total Power Exchange FLR-Female Led Relationship with a slave I deem worthy of serving me.

You'd be controlled and owned as PROPERTY! That means I will control you emotionally, physically, mentally, sexually and financially. I'll own and dominate the very essence of your existence. 

If you feel like you're what I'm seeking feel free to message me and I'll see if you're worthy of serving at my feet. Also include clear Pic/s of yourself. 

I DON'T do anything illegal nor anything that will put MY slave's life in danger!

Why flag my post? I just don't get it... Stop please

Well, let me get the basics out of the way. I am a real woman, not spam, not a man, and not crazy. I am a black woman, both parents in the home, middle class (when there was a middle class) upbringing. I am 43 but I'm always thought to be younger. I am a true average height, a little heavier than I should be, but active. I like being outside or inside lounging on the sofa. I love to travel, prefer the beach but anywhere is an adventure. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetarian. I have a few tattoos, very visible, and plan on more. But what I always say is that I am more than my tattoos and not the typical tattooed lady. I am intelligent and can talk intelligently about most topics, and I'm a great listener too. For the right man I am thoughtful, caring, loyal, honest, and kind. I would live to be able to send random text in the middle of the day, and share a drink at the end of the day, talking about anything.

Who I'm looking for. I have had relationships with white men all my life and they are who I am attracted to. I grew up in TX, but lived the last 16 in NC. But now I'm back in TX. I swoon for a rugged southern gentleman, who can treat me like a lady and become a partner in crime. Adventurous, successfully, honest, sensual man with integrity. I'm looking for someone who can be a one woman man. Interested in making our relationship strong and long lasting. 

Together we work to make the other better. I dont care about age, mature but young at heart. I would want someone healthy and active. It would be great if we could workout together or at least hold the other accountable for our fitness goals. With that being said, if you are in my area great, if not a long distance relationship is ok with me, but the ultimate goal is for one or the other to relocate ( I can, or you can). I am not interested in married men at all, do not ask. I have a grown son, and I'm ok with children.

Please send a photo, yours gets mine, if no photo understand that what you look like makes a difference. Even if we have been talking, what you look like could be an added plus or the end. Just like you, l have to be attracted to you physically.

Just a young Hispanic woman who is out on the search for a good hard working man. A man who has his life together. Don't live with your parents. Have transportation, and a good or decent job. I like my men super tall & between the ages of 28-35 nothing younger, nothing older. You don't have to be perfect, model, toned and workout but also don't be super fat and overweight. I am ONLY into Hispanic and white men. Preferably with NO kids. I don't have any kids. Please don't have a history of being married and now are divorced. If the break it has been recently then you are not over her. I don't want to be a rebound. Must enjoy fun spontaneous adventures, traveling, beer, breweries, food trucks, museums, and sometimes be a kid at heart. Know when to be serious and when to be funny. Be a good guy, a romantic sweet guy. Do not be a broke guy. If you are broke then don't date but I am also not looking for someone to support me.

Mid 20s, stand at 5'1"", Hispanic. I have my own car, place and a good job. Live in the Fort Worth area. I enjoy spending my time at the stockyards on weekends. Trying new beer. I enjoy bars and good food. I am not fat, or super skinny. I am a small chubby girl. Well not really too chubby. I love to be outdoors, I'm open to new fun adventures.

I am seeking a man and one man only who is of legal age and of any race who is comfortable with his own intelligence, sense of humor and who desires a woman who can hold her own in a conversation, yet does not dominate it.
A good listener, in other words.
I am also seeking a man that knows what he wants, knows what a lady wants and someone that is not into mental games.
A man who is open minded, intelligent, mildly irreverent, insightful and not afraid of emotional intimacy.
A man that is creative, fun in the bedroom but can also hold a conversation outside of the bedroom is highly preferred.
I'm also seeking a man who can financially assist me as I do have a very controlling husband. 
Maintaining your privacy and mine are off importance.
A man whose drug and disease free is an absolute must.
I'm not into head games.
I'm only into sexually and sensual sinister games.
I'm a one of a kind woman and a lover of life.
I have many long time friends near and far that make up my world.
I value fun, laughter and stimulating conversation.
My daily mindfulness practice continues to remind me that every moment is perfect and overflowing with joy and serenity.
I appreciate connecting with true friends.
I am compassionate and grounded and I delight in the joy that is revealed in which I express sincere appreciation and pleasure.
So, in some ways, I am not terribly particular about a friend, lover and companion.
On the other hand, I am particular in that I am basically looking for one thing, a connection.
You may call it chemistry on every level, physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual.
So in summary, I am not hard to please but at the same time I am a bit picky.
I have acquired much in my lifetime but have recently begun a quest to downsize and simplify as much as possible.

My ideal man is the dream guy that loves deeply and passionately towards his woman. He cares about her unconditionally and will do anything to keep her safe. A man that wants to take care of her so she doesn't have to work. He will do anything and everything to see her happy and make her smile no matter. He will go above and beyond for her even though she doesn't ask him to. A guy who will leave messages on her phone, calls her because he misses her, texts her to say I love you just because, sends her flowers also just because. I have never had a relationship like this before and I know this is what I am looking for.
