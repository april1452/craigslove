Hey! 
So how should I start off? Well, first off I am very dominate and have a bad attitude. I am Hispanic and young. I like treating my male counter part badly and being spoiled. Basically, if you like being humiliated and worship one women let me know. 



By the way, that is me in my picture

Where to begin?

I like a good concert at Verizon or Bass Hall.
My favorite color is purple with pink a close second.
I'm the kind of person who uses a paper towel on my hand to open public bathroom doors.
Appreciate a good roll in the hay that lasts at least two hours minimum once a week.

Love to cook up a meal at home .. preferably at your place.
Enjoy a nice walk along the trails when its not too hot.
Fairly conservative in public but mildly uninhibited behind closed doors.
Love to lick on my boyfriend and then ride him for at least an hour.

Buy my gas at Shell because the yellow and red color scheme appeals to me.
A careful driver and try not to text in the car except maybe at stoplights but 
even then I keep an eye on it and don't miss the light when it turns green.
I consider sex to be a healthy normal activity and try to practice as much as possible.

Used to sew a lot but don't have the time for it anymore.
Like to garden and play in the dirt.
Enjoy talking on the phone late at night with a boyfriend to put me to sleep.
Cowgirl is my favorite followed by missionary legs up and of course, doggie.

So .. what about you?

If you are single, white, local, no taller than 6' and no shorter than 7"", drop me a line...

:)

Hi there, first off I am not a regular on Craigslist, but I am obviously looking in the wrong places for my ""Mr. Right"".
I am 23 years old, I work fulltime, my family is very important to me, and I am a Bigger Girl.
I do have goals in life, as we all should. I love baseball, and I am a die-hard CARDS fan. I do occasionally drink. I will make the most out of any situation.?
I am exhausted from meeting all the wrong men and tired of looking for the right ones. This will be my last shot before I honestly give up on love.?

What I am looking for:

Someone who has a great personality and sense of humor. I'm all about the laughter.?
Someone who has a job, because I have a hard enough time taking care of myself financially, I don't need that.
And we'll go from there.
Send a picture of yourself with your first reply.

Please, send me an E-mail.--> Put something witty in the subject line so I can get rid of the spam.
Thank you so much for your time. ??

Finding Love is like finding a New Job. There is an interview process and that determines whether or not if you want to move forward with them. Its hard sometimes to find that one person who will love you for who you are. Sometimes it feels like were playing Powerball and just praying that we get the numbers correct. Sometimes waiting around for Mr. Right to show up does not happen and years go by. So taking a chance and praying that I can meet a nice man is wishful.
For me I am a single mom to two kids. My kids mean the world to me. They do come first in my life. I am looking for a man that can I understand that. Family time is important. I also work full-time and enjoy my job. Im also a photographer on the side. I am ""Awake"" .In my free time I like going to the movies, karaoke, and going to the park. I also like to take road trips.
I am looking for a man who is understanding and caring. Traditional and a Hopeless Romantic. I am looking for a man who wants a relationship with possible marriage. Laughter, Good Communicator and Listener.
I do work full-time Monday - Friday and I will get back with you as soon as I can. I am looking for true love.
Please send me a Bio and a Picture. I will respond with a picture as well. I am a nice person with a good heart.

Hi. I'm a cute, sexy, attractive, mature and vivacious African American woman who really wants a loving and lasting relationship. I love to travel, bowl, movies, go out to dinner, or make some homecooked meals for a good man who appreciates and HAS TIME FOR ME. 

I do attend church regularly. Raising grandchildren, 2 teenagers and a 8 yr old.

In my mind, I picture the man who will steal my heart to be a very tall, handsome and attractive African American male, around my age, a natural leader who is fit, well endowed and takes care of himself, doesn't mind the children and ready for a long term relationship.

(doesn't work 24/7, doesn't have so many family obligations that I'm dead last in his life, and has plans to make someone part of his life). A non smoker, drink occasionally, drug drama and disease free.

Your pic gets mine. No photo no response. I only need the one true guy for me.

Welcome to my posting.. This may not be the best place to find a good man, but you never know, so here I try.....
I am a pretty, smart, sweet, petite in size, woman in search of the right man for me. I was born and raised in a rural area in Wisconsin and is where I still currently live. I am willing to consider relocating for love, (or you here) so distance could be just a temporary dilemma. I am fun, but yet I have good morals, and try to be kind to others. I am a hard worker, good cook, and keep a clean cozy home. I take good care of myself, and I am told I look much younger. I enjoy nature, animals, bonfires, fishing, (ice fishing) hunting, cooking, cuddling, cleaning, trucks, and Country and Christian music. I have the right stuff to offer, and I am an all around great catch. I have 2 grown kids, and now its time for me!
You should be first and for most a gentleman. You should be above 45 years old. You should have a good head on your shoulders, and have your life together. You can be ""clean cut"" or a ""bad boy"" I do not have a certain ""type"". I will know you are the one when that time comes. If interested please send a nice email explaining yourself, what you are looking for, and a photo we can exchange.

Hi all, 
Good evening! 

I am an Asian with 2 kids. I have been single over 2 years and been a widow over 5 years. I think I am ready to get back to the dating scenes. First of all, I need to tell you that I am not a skinny girl. I am a woman with some extra fat. Ah well, I used to be fit and I am going to start to lose weights. Second, I am not looking for a hook up or NSA. I am truly to find a good friend that we can go on more- a relationship. 

Here are some information of me. I am college graduated. I have my own things in order. I have stuffs what I need and want. I am NOT a gold digger that just looking for a place to live, blah blah blah. At the same time, I am not looking a gold digger too. I hope you have your own things on your shoulders too. This is very important. A man who can meet these conditions tells a lot how you treats your life already. 

And ideally, hope you are between 30-45. I know age is just a number. But sometimes age is important for some points too. 

Please include a pic with you and put your name and favorite sport team in subject. Then I will reply. Thanks for reading. Have a great one.

I am a SWF, 5'6, busty/curvy (size 12/14). I'm also an attractive woman who has confidence in herself and knows what she wants. For those of you who don't appreciate a gorgeous woman inside and out but put everything in perspective about a size, shape or weight then you know what you're attracted to and I'm not trying to convince you otherwise. We all have a ""type"" and physical attraction and intimacy is required in a long term fulfilling relationship. As to what I am looking for...a SWM, in his late 30's to early 40's, that lives in the north Texas area who wants to talk, date and ultimately have a relationship with. Just like everyone else I know what I'm attracted to, I like men who are taller than me. But more importantly I like a man who knows how to take charge, who has a great sense of humor and who's charm is effortless and endearing. Attraction is important, we all know this. Please respond and tell me about yourself, send a recent picture and we'll go from there. Thanks.

I'm so tired of being a good woman only to deal with men who only want to play games! Tired of being lonely at night! Tired of not having anyone to share my life with! Tired of having to go through the bad days alone. Tired of not having anyone to share the good times with either. I want someone to laugh with and hold me when I cry. I want my Best Friend.... Lover.... and King!! 

I'm not looking for perfection or prince charming. I just want a man who knows how to be a man a treat a lady! Whose not into games, lies or deception. Who knows how to communicate and doesn't have a tamper or mean spirit. I like to have fun and I want to enjoy life to the fullest. I love adventure, traveling and experiencing new things. 

I don't want an old man... I want a partner in crime lol. Race isn't imp but being healthy is! If you are looking for perfection I'M NOT FOR YOU!

Hey guys!! I'm kinda just writing this because I feel like my social life has hit a plateau. I don't feel like I'm meeting worth while guys when I go out (If that makes sense). Things just always kind of fizzle out before anything starts.So I thought I'd try CL for some texting buddies to see where things go...

Annnywaayss enough about that! I'm 22 and a full time student. I love music, CONCERTS, reading, movies and hanging out with fun people. I like to think that that I'm bubbly, energetic, and pretty fluent in sarcasm. I have a big family and they're my world. :D

That's me in an incredibly boring nutshell and if you've made it this far I guess you're wondering what I'm looking for in you. I think really I'm just looking for a man that knows how to hold a conversation, who's witty and a great sense of humor wouldn't hurt either.;) I'm really looking for someone 22-32 ish years old.

I'm definitely not looking for sex, so if that's what you're looking for, I apologize you've read this far. I'm really awkwardly bad at these kinds of things, but I hope I made a good first impression on someone! I'm just gonna leave this here because I have no idea what else to say lol

P.S. Put your favorite band as the header to rule out bots...Please! :)
P.S.S. Sorry this post is so painfully awkward!

I decided to take my pictures down because I felt like it would help weed out some people I don't want replying. I can assure you that I'm attractive and expect you to be, as well. 

Hi, there. I'm looking for something a little different, maybe. First of all, let me say that I am in a relationship and have been for a few months with a man who I also live with. He's a good man. That being said, I'm pretty sure he isn't the man for me but I'm going to stay with him unless you just happen to be my soul mate. The reason he isn't the man for me is because he's simple. I'm quite the opposite of simple, although a lot of times I wish I could just be as simple as most. I'm a deep thinker, who has a touch of social anxiety and a deep yearning for this fairy tale love, or intimacy if you will, that I picture in my head. This man I'm with barely touches me and maybe wants to make love to me once a week if I'm lucky. I need more than that. I want to feel wanted and be touched everywhere, constantly, in any way. I want to be looked at like I'm the best thing in the world. I want to sexually be taken and feel owned by a strong, bull headed, man who can't seem to get enough of me. I want to be made love to and fucked at the same time, by someone I have a connection with on a soul mate type level. If you think you can be this man for me, you'll have to be willing to come pick me up at a late, discreet hour, whenever we get the hunger for each other, and bring me back before day light. If we get that far, we can start figuring out other ways to see each other. You're also under the age of 40 and above the age of 23. I'd love to connect with another deep thinker. Someone who has a need to stay up late and talk about nothing and everything. I'd prefer you be 420 friendly. I consider myself shy at first, but funny, odd and quick witted once I'm warmed up to someone. My hobbies include, fishing, riding motorcycles, learning, listening, music and long walks through cemeteries. Serious inquiries only please. No pic gets you no reply. Intrigue me with your words. I'm waiting.

Hey there

Let's face it... we all have someone specific in mind that we would call our ideal other half. Me - not so much. But I thought maybe I'm looking for the wrong type of guy. For this reason, I'll mix it up to make it a little fun. Here goes:
You:
Single, white male
33 to 40s
Self-sufficient
One-woman type
Fun
Loving
Family oriented
No drama
Believes in chivalry

Let me know if you are the one. Who knows, maybe I'm the one for you too.

I like to read, sing, dance, listen to music, watch movies/television, debate current event issues and cook.

If you are interested in anything I said above and are between the ages of 35-55 then I hope to hear from you. Please send me an e-mail telling me your age, location and what you are looking for. Tell me a little bit about yourself. Will trade pic for pic.

Im not looking for a sugar daddy or someone to take care of me although, I'm not interested in someone that lives in his mother's basement, you must have a job and a home of your own. It shows responsibility. If your my age and you're not responsible than you probably couldn't handle a responsible relationship. I am looking for my best friend and someone that wants to be their partners best friend in life, someone to laugh with, have fun with and eventually share a life together. I do have children so you must like kids and you must be ready for a future with a women. I'm only looking for someone that's ready to settle down. Honestly, I just want a damn good man. Is that to much to ask for? Lol .. If you will send a short bio of yourself and a picouple that would help get this convo started and Ifor I like what I read,you may even get my number. I'm not wanting to text and email forever, I would like to meet up and get to know eachother. Fyi, it was pouring down rain yesterday, so that you know I'm real.

Hi, 

I can't believe I am looking for a nice guy on Craigslist, but I find that real people read these things and I thought I would see if you were reading this today. 

I am told I am attractive, I am a Big Beautiful Woman( BBW ), I am a very active woman, busy with work, friends, grand kids, but I am willing to make the time to get to know you.and see if we have a connection. I really want to share my life with someone. Even though I am busy, I get lonely and I am tired of spending free time all by myself . 

So are you ""spontaneous"" ? How about coffee? Walk in the park, or walk on the beach, watch a movie, listen to some music, take a drive up the Central Coast, watch the sun set or star gaze? Of course not in one day. But I think you get what I am saying. =)

If I am a lady that you would like to meet, please feel free to contact me.

Please put in the subject line where your from and your age. (like Santa Maria 55), this way I will know you are real. I will not even look at any other emails. 

Again I am NOT looking for a one night stand, or if you are going through family drama I am not interested either, also one more thing I having nothing against different places,but I am not wanting a long distance relationship. If any of this is you then please move along and do not contact me. 

I look forward to talking to you soon. Have a wonderful day!

Wanting to spend time with someone who can eventually become a special friend. Would like to find someone who has similar likes but also are into their own thing. I like different, unique, easy going, classic rock but all kinds of music, all types of art, psychic stuff and rocks. Whether simply hanging out or doing a few things over the weekend and deciding the last minute is very cool as well. Must cook/grill because I really do not or let's say I need to take a few classes. Must be self sufficient as I do not want to take care of you financially if that makes sense. A big plus, you know how to play a guitar, teach playing a guitar, drink occasionally, have a great sense of humor, have a secure job, landscape, cook, not complain to much about life in general...nag...bitch, nor be married and just be overall happy. Also, someone in their 40s - 50s or 60s. Noticed the landscaping..hint..hint.

I had a guy tell me that my face was pretty one time. I told him that the meaning behind ""pretty face"" is your ""to big"" for someone to just say you are pretty...lol!

We ask how each others day is going. We talk/text during the day. We take up for each other. One gets hurt the other feels the pain. We take care of family. I have no children but will welcome yours into our home. We save for a raining day. We take vacations together. We have our time with our individual friends, but we stay loyal to each other. We only have eyes for each other. We never hurt each other on purpose. We strive to be each others best friend. In marriage, divorce is not an option. We work it out. We mow our yard. We pay our bills. We hug often and hold hands in the movies. We hold hands walking. We kiss and are intimate often. We work or jobs and come home to each other. We believe in chivalry. What would you like to add?

A little of my personality, a good heart (its been beat up a bit) no children. One spoilt dog. Home and car owner. Sweet, classy, intelligent, professional, strive to live a life of excellence. If you've ever listened to Joel Olsten you'll know what that means. Likes, drives to nowhere. dining out, movies, flea markets, craft fair, concerts in the park, boating, the Florida beach, travel, 

If you can see yourself in this life. If you have old fashioned values and know how to court a woman. I would love to hear from you. A picture is not needed at this time. Just a really good spark of interest that this is the life you desire also. I like men with meat on thier bones. I really like heavy guys.

Dear Love,
I wanted to write you a short note. Just to let you know I was thinking about you. I hope your having a great time, but I wanted to let you know that I'm missing you. Missing the way only you can make me laugh with your silliness. And the way you snuggle up with me to watch a little late night tv, because neither of us could sleep. I miss singing in the car with you, on one of our last minute road trips. I just miss everything about you. Even the things I dont like so much. I still miss them because its a part of you and who you are. 
But since I haven't heard from you, I was wondering if you missed me too? After the Walking Dead premier I didn't have anyone to talk with about it. The only person I thought about was you. I hope you saw it, because if you did it would be something we did at the same time. And that would make me feel a little better, knowing that we watched something together, kinda. I know I'm not perfect, but I honestly hope your happy and wish you all the best.
If your feeling lonely, you can always talk to me, I'm a good listener, remember. Ok, well bye. I hope to hear from you soon, but if not take care.

Always,

DFW has grown so much. So many things to see but this would be much more enjoyable to me with a big teddy bear type of guy to explore them with. The sweet, boyfriend type of guy, not the ""player"" sorts please. Perky blonde here, so teddy bears where are you ? E mails and texting first, then maybe go on from there. Good friendship is always a treasure to find also.

I am relatively new to the area and haven't made many friends that I have a lot in common with since I have moved here. I love being outside, going fishing, going shooting, 4-wheeling, going to country music concerts, going to the lake, camping and most of all just hanging out with good people. I am very easy going and can basically have a good time no matter where I go or what I do. I guess I need to tell you that I am a bigger girl since it seems to be very important to most people on here. I don't necessarily see myself that way so it doesn't keep me from doing much of anything. I just need some new people to get out of the house with and get active again. If you are interested, attach a picture of yourself and tell me a little about yourself. I'm not interested in anyone who is married, NSA, or any druggies.

Hey I finish watching another romantic Nicholas Sparks movie, 'The Best of Me', I realize two things; 1) I'd rather watch 'Your Neighbor is a Paycho' or even 'AMillion Ways to Die'. 2) I should not trust Nicholas Sparks on a lonely Valentine Eve. 

I mean seriously, this guy really must be a woman. Right? Who comes up with these scripts. It can't be a man... Can it?!? Anyway, enough of that mans romantic ramblings..

I briefly read through the 'men for woman' ads and thought I'd vomit. G spots, spankings, stockings, feet fetishes, use my sperm to have a baby, I just want to smell your hair, etc, lots of creepy stuff, etc,... Seriously people, I can't even imagine what goes through your head at night. Eeeek!

Look. I'm a normal 41 (newly 41) year old woman who seeks to have intelligent conversation with a normal professional male. If you want all that above stuff, make sure you know your lady well, or she's gonna walk.... Hell, if she's smart, she's gonna run, and run fast! 

Im already skittish about this whole CL thing. So, don't scare a newby off. I'm looking for a SWM with a JOB, established. Sweet, honest, knows how to treat a lady. No criminal record. Let me reiterate the SINGLE part in case you missed it. 

A little background on myself. I'm a mother, a wife (I took that job seriously. However, he didnt and I'm not going to be the damsel in distress.) I'm not looking for a man to take care of me or my kids. I'm looking for
Someone who can share good common life goals, good morals, offer friendly advice, make me laugh till I cry. Someone who can smile when their having a bad day, and is cabable of still making me smile. Someone who helps that little old lady change her tire along side the road. Someone who can look at me first thing in the morning, all flaws ablaze and still, truthfully, tell me I'm beautiful. Someone who is not afraid to show their feelings and someone who is not juggling 4 girls to see who puts out first. 

If this sounds like you and your between the ages of 35-45. Try me. Give me great conversation and help me find balance.

Hey guys, so I am posting this for a single friend of mine. She has been single for awhile and I think it's time she gets back in the dating scene and in a relationship. She is 27 Hispanic single mom. She is told she is beautiful by plenty of guys and she doesn't have a hard time finding one but the ones she has found are jerks and don't deserve her. I'm on here hoping just giving it a try see if I can find someoen for her. I will tell you more about her if you reply. Please put your favorite color in the subject line if you can't do this simple task then you will more than likely not be getting a reply back.

It's a beautiful day in Dallas and as I am sitting here enjoying my mimosa, I figured that there is something missing and that is a gentleman who is confident, polished, ambitious and clever. He must be humble, eclectic and look sharp in a suit.

I'm looking for someone that is not afraid to commit, is reliable and doesn't lie. I know that is rare, but I do believe there are some out there. I am open minded, and not overly opinionated. I think most people like things done their own way if they can, but I am reasonable and do listen. 

I don't like laziness and am a hard worker myself. I can be laid back or the opposite. I enjoy good conversation, laughing, and stimulating verbal communication. I know it's not easy taking a chance - again, but I am worth it once I am hooked.

I have travelled a lot domestically and internationally.I believe in spiritual growth and commitment, while not being over the top. I consider myself to be very patriotic and still feel pride of country rise up in me, when I hear the national anthem.Moving forward in life is what matters to me, and is what really counts with me. Kissing is a passion.......I am passionate in so many aspects of my life, looking for my equal. Ultimate goal for everyone is to take a chance and connect with someone, whether it is for a short time or hopefully, on a long term basis. 

Seeking someone who wants to ""complement"" my life as I wish to do the same for them. Strong in their Christian faith as I, but do enjoy having fun. Would like to continue life's journey with my soul-mate experiencing the exciting journey that fate has in store for us, enjoying learning about each other and exploring old and new places together. Enjoy have fun as well as quiet times, it is about quality time with someone special. 

Very compassionate, as well as passionate with people I care about. Communication and honesty are high on my list of needs. If you like to communicate and are sincere and honest, then let's ""strike up as match"" and see if we would be good together to continue life's journey. I am looking for age range from 45-upward.

Hi! 

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my ad! I guess I am just feeling really lonely lately and hoping to find someone that might want to connect and see what happens. Not into fwb or similar situations sorry, I want a relationship and a fun one at that! I like to have fun and try new things, love to travel (although don't get to as much as I would like), meet new people, etc. 

I am 5'7 (taller for a female), white, brown eyes and long brown hair. I like to get dolled up for an evening out but love to stay in and watch some good tv as well. I love learning and still strive to as often as possible, even if its just watching documentaries. I am overweight and a ""chunk"" as some would call it, trying to be healthier but I don't let it get me down and I hope it doesn't bother you either! 

I am very open to the guy I am looking for - hopefully has a job, car and place to stay. I am not into drugs and hope he isn't either. I tend to find people who are a little larger to be attractive to me, but I really am so open. I would prefer to find a lasting relationship so I would prefer someone who is closer to my age *27 years young* and happens to be white (but again open to everyone). 

I hope to meet you soon and start a great relationship, otherwise, I'll keep my head up and keep hoping that our paths will cross soon. 

Happy thursday everyone!

Cute Mixed BBW coming to town the end of Feb for a little under a month. Hoping to get the ball rolling now, so it'll be less awkward once we meet. 
Going for business but looking for some fun as well. Race and status are unimportant to me but I do very much prefer an older man. (I do enjoy being spoiled ;) )

If you only knew how often you cross my mind, consuming my thoughts. I miss you even though I've never had you. Throughout my life I have been lucky enough to experience love and I have also learnt what it feels like to go without. The dull ache from loneliness courses through my body. The tears have spilt out of my eyes landing on my pillow because sometimes it's too much to take. I know exactly how much I have to give to you. Craving so desperately your gentle embrace, just tight enough that I won't slip away but light enough to give me the room I need to breath. Wanting to drink you in and escape into you. I often sit alone at my table eating the food I've prepared looking at your empty spot, wishing for your companionship. Those easy going conversations and comfortable silences. Have I had you, only for you to slip away? Are you searching for me right now? 
I've looked for you time and time again always coming up short. Where will we find each other? Online? Will we see each other somewhere and recognize a safe place in one another's eyes? Oh my sweet, dear friend, my lover come to me. Let my words awaken you. I wait for you as patiently as I can possibly bear.

Hello! First things first, I'm poly. If you don't know what that is or that notion offends you...this ad isn't for you. Also just to state up front, I'm not seeking a couple or to join a triad. 

I'm a 35 year old female searching for a guy who is looking for a casual dating relationship that has the ability to turn into something more on down the road. I do currently have a secondary partner that I'm very pleased with, but I'm searching for someone that, at some point, can fill a primary role in my life. 

So this is me. I'm looking for a guy in close proximity to the HEB area and under the age of 50 with little to no drama that has space in his life to hang out with a great casual woman.

I'm a kinky gal, searching for a kinky guy with an open mind. I am a feminine, hedonistic geek with a propensity for assertive and intelligent companions. And when I say geek, I mean I am nice broad spectrum type of geek. I watch the History Channel almost as often as I watch FOX (as in Bones not O'Reilly). I love the outdoors. I camp frequently and sometimes in less than ideal situations (and I enjoy it). I like Buffy and Firefly. In my spare time, I play video games. New gadgets make me weak in the knees. I enjoy traveling and do so frequently both with work and on my own. I read a great deal (and more than what some would consider to be healthy) with varied interests. I love small ""hole in the wall"" restaurants, ethnic foods, and interactive dining. I find geeks incredibly sexy no matter what flavor of geek they might be. Mainly because to be a geek means you are passionate about something, and passion is never a bad thing.

I am a curvy 5'4"" and 190 pounds. I am incredibly happy with my body, and you should be as well. I am a brunette with curly hair.

Hopefully all of this gives you a good understanding of just what it is I am looking for, and hopefully it is appealing to you as well. I strive to be open and honest so I welcome any questions anyone may have. Please respond with a photo and I will do the same. Thanks for reading.

Hi, 

I am a really sweet and caring girl just looking for my new best friend. I am envious of those couples that seem to really enjoy being with each other and hoping one day to find the same. I am a hopeless romantic - I listen to all the most romantic songs and imagine my prince charming coming to dance with me to them. 

Corny I know, but a girl can dream. I am have various interests, some of which actually coincide with mainstream ""masculine"" hobbies -- ie video gaming, watching the cowboys (they were rough without romo this year), hiking, etc. I love to try new things as well, and enjoy finding new people to do things with. 

I hate meeting people with expectations, just some great friends that possibly develops into more would be great. I mean it can take a little while for anyone to open up, and being rushed or forced never really works out anyway. 

I am 27 years old, white, brown eyes and hair, and overweight. Yes, its true. I have two cats that I adore and hope that you love animals as well. 

I am open to chatting and seeing where it goes from there, let me know of some interests and hobbies you enjoy. I hope to meet some nice people! Please be *somewhat* close to my age and drug free. Some ambition in life would be great too, just someone who knows what they want and how to get there.

I am a beautiful woman inside and out seeking one honest man to build a lifetime friendship with and someone I can grow old with. Im not into casual encounters,I have a huge heart, I am sincere and well educated. I have my own vehicle and my own job, but I'm lacking that certain man to share my everyday with. I am tall and sexy.I enjoy anything that I can share as a couple including dinners movies traveling taking a nice walk on a warm day and snuggling on a cold night. I am looking for a single white male professional physically fit and attractive.. I am also looking for someone who is a Christian and values integrity. At my age I have faced many struggles and believe God has carried me through them all. Please, NO drugs, social drinking only.If that is you let's see if there's a connection. 

I enjoy reading, traveling, and writing. I consider myself to be vibrant, creative and fun. If you enjoy young African-American ladies, If you need arm candy to a social event, count me in or a vacation to The Bahamas in a bikini.
My goal is to meet an older gentleman. He must be kind in all aspects. He must be willing to take a risk. Most importantly I'm looking for a gentleman who can treat me like a woman deserves to be treated.

I've been told I'm like ""the Girl Scout.""

47, DWF, DDF, not HWP, non smoker, social drinker, genuinely nice, professional lady. I go to church, work in an office, but choose to live in the country. I like the peacefulness. Am versatile and have varied interests including fb, hockey, baseball, Matchbox 20, Colbie Caillat, Jim Brickman Michael Buble, country, pop, rock, big band, music from 50s, 60s, reggae, and more. No rap or heavy metal. No tats or weird piercings... Just me. Not really lonely, but realizing I'm missing something. Happy hitting a street fair, sporting event, movie, dinner, walking in a park, etc., or curling up on the couch with a good movie. I'm your best friend wrapped up in girl wrapping - which makes kissing much nicer 😊!

WILL NOT consider one night stands, NSA, fwb, or the likes or dating a married man. 

If interested, please tell me about yourself, send a decent pic and realize I don't care about your latest greatest tattoo or that fantastic goatee... Or even that chest baring pic so many sport. 

Keep it classy.

Hello I'm just testing this out, who knows maybe this works:) I'm seeking a Christian man to get to know, NOT LOOKING TO HOOK UP! There are plenty of other posts for that. I'm very down to earth and I believe in seeing the good in everyone. I love to have fun and I keep an open mind. I have a great job and I am also pursuing a masters degree. I am willing to trade pic for pic. I stay very active so I prefer someone in shape but it's not a requirement. No married men. No older than 36 no younger than 21 sorry. I am AA just adding that because I know some people care about that.

Hello If you only knew how often you cross my mind, consuming my thoughts. I miss you even though I've never had you. Throughout my life I have been lucky enough to experience love and I have also learnt what it feels like to go without. The dull ache from loneliness courses through my body. The tears have spilt out of my eyes landing on my pillow because sometimes it's too much to take. I know exactly how much I have to give to you. 
Craving so desperately your gentle embrace, just tight enough that I won't slip away but light enough to give me the room I need to breath. Wanting to drink you in and escape into you. 
I often sit alone at my table eating the food I've prepared looking at your empty spot, wishing for your companionship. Those easy going conversations and comfortable silences. Have I had you, only for you to slip away? Are you searching for me right now? 
I've looked for you time and time again always coming up short. Where will we find each other? Online? Will we see each other somewhere and recognize a safe place in one another's eyes? Oh my sweet, dear friend, my lover come to me. Let my words awaken you. I wait for you as patiently as I can possibly bear.

I am looking for a long term relationship with a man who I feel passion, chemistry, a strong physical connection with.
I have only found 1 guy in my life who I felt this way for and I am desperately craving it again. It's hard to find. 
It's not like being with some average person you settle for or someone with just a nice body and gorgeous smile you find hot. 
Its an intense connection emotionally and physically. I do believe in ""love at first sight.""
Here's the catch: I am shy, insecure, inexperienced, a little overweight and dependent. 
I want a man to take care of me, to boost my self esteem and compliment me regularly. 
To tell me and show me he wants me and not stop after a few months into the relationship and expect me to ""just know."" 
I need a man to help show me its ok to be me, ok to open up and let loose and not hide. Someone patient with me being inexperienced, someone non-judgmental,
and someone who can motivate me to be better, to be who I want to be, to be who you want in a girl and to wow you.
A guy to work out with me and be active with to push me out of my comfort zone.
I can be fiesty and needy, and I need a real man who can handle it. 
This all seems like a lot, but I don't think its too much different than most relationship hurdles.
I can be a great lover/partner to the right person.I'd like a man who is strong, with good hygiene, has a stable income, a car, 
27-40yrs old, drug and disease free, taller than 5' 7"" and preferably doesnt smoke cigarettes.
If this describes you and you think you can give me what I need, hit me up and we'll talk more.
Please be honest and up front about what you're looking for and what you need, also be as detailed as possible about yourself. 
I am serious and dont want to waste too much time with pointless email tag. Must include a couple photos of yourself or no reply.
Thanks

1st let me say I'm a totally cool chic, college educated, have had some absolute amazing positions in my career that most only dream about. I've learned that a career isn't what makes a person special no matter what others tell you. 
I'm actually more humble and kind than I am arrogant and uncaring of others thoughts and feelings.

So here comes the difficult part and never in a million years did I ever think I'd be in a situation where I would be seeking something a bit unorthodox. 
Bare with me while I gather my thoughts and try to cautiously govern what I'm about to say...............
I'd like to meet an attractive man between the age of 29-37
You must be a Non Smoker
Have a solid job or career
Own your own vehicle
Be completely straight 
Fully believe in God (Christian) not atheist, agnostic or anything else that I might of forgotten to list, oh did I say and not into anything Satanic? Yikes
You Must be healthy and range from fit to average 
If you are Military affiliated that works for me since my background is Military. Military just seems to mesh better with other Military types.

If you like dogs that's cool since I'm thinking about getting one. 
I have a cool pad, my own vehicle and my own income. 
I'm average looking and I'm considered attractive average. I believe confidence and high self esteem go a long way and make a difference. 
I don't drink, do drugs and I'm 100% positive I am disease free so you be too.

I'm a chic that can clock anyone, female or male if need be. However brawls are not what I seek. I was raised with manners and proper etiquette has been instilled within me. 

In short something has come up where I need to have someone else with me for a bit to help make me feel secure, safe and protected while at home.
Oh and I'm going to install locks where there were none and I'm changing the others. Invasion of any kind whether it be home invasion, personal invasion or any other intrusions or acts that make a person not feel safe is pure evil, especially if it may not be a stranger. 
I'm very new to this area and haven't really met anyone yet. 
It would be nice if you know how to shoot and you wouldn't mind teaching me how to shoot. I prefer a rifle 1st before a handgun but that can be discussed. In the past I haven't had very good aim but I'm looking to improve. 

That is all I'm willing to share in reference to the circumstances I'm posting about on CL. 
I'm sitting here telling myself this is ridiculous but at this point what do I really have to lose? I definitely can sense a predator type whether they seem charming or not and my personal space and comfort zone has already been violated. 
My thoughts now are Freck it!!! I seek to have someone with me most nights until I get things sorted out. 
Also do understand I hate drama, I go out of my way to avoid drama and I do expect you to have very little drama. I'm only going to deal with the average normal % of drama that just comes with life. Otherwise stay out of my life. 
Yep, I'm not like most chics, in fact I think I'm a lot cooler than many of them. 
I'm good to those who are good to me. 
Others that I'm good to and I give them no name to place with a kind person who's helped them when in need, well that's between God and I.
So if you think you can hangout with me without too many questions asked and just enjoy one day at a time send me a response that has more than one sentence in it. 
Tell me about yourself and why I can have some initial trust in you and feel safe!?! Include a photo or I WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT RESPOND BACK!
Trust me when I say I'm highly intelligent and I'm fully aware how odd and nuts this post seems. Somethings are better not explained and that's where I stand on the subject at this time. If you are intelligent you'll have a good enough understanding on your own. 
Don't ask me my age just know I'm in my 30's, good to go!
Happy New Year!

My life is very full at the moment, but there is still something missing. I have 2 amazing children, a good job, a house, and my own car. I want for very little, but the lack of a man in my life is becoming an issue. I am a strong, independent woman, and I don't ""need"" a man in my life - I want to make that very clear. I want a man to share my already amazing life with. A man with integrity, who is kind, honest, respectful, considerate, and in control of his life. A man that will treat me like a queen, but understands I am not a damsel in distress. I want to find a man that will love me unconditionally and allow me to do the same. I want to settle down and create a new life with the man of my dreams. Craigslist may not be the perfect place for that, but until they create a Build-A-Man store, this is where I'm at. 

What I need from you is very simple, you MUST be single-I can't stress this enough!- I will not date a married man, so don't even try. You should have a steady job, transportation, and be ready to settle down with the right woman. I am looking for a serious relationship, not a fling. I don't mind if you have children, but I don't want any more of my own. I will be more than happy to blend our two families into a loving home. 

I live west of Benbrook. If this sounds appealing to you, please send me an email, and let's see if we hit it off.

I don't party and I don't do drugs or smoke. I drink but not all the time. I love God above everything and I want someone who is committed to God before I submit to them. Marriage is the key but at the right time with the right one. I have always dated black men. That doesn't mean that I won't date outside that race if I can be attracted to you or you sweep me off my feet then I'm open. I love tall guys. Please be 5'10 & above.

This is probably the third time I've tried to find something meaningful, but no such luck. I'm a full time student at UNT and I also work full time, which means I'm an extremely busy girl. I'm hoping to find someone as ambitious as I am and that can give me a much needed push when necessary. I love to sing, read, and sit on the porch to enjoy a nice cold beer. I'm much more of a homebody than anything else, but I do love going out occasionally.

I don't care much about appearance and I definitely don't care about race. Age doesn't really matter, but I am 22. I care a lot more about personality, intellect, and ambition. If you think that we can make a meaningful connection, respond with a picture and little bit about yourself. Of course, I'll also send a picture. Put your favorite NFL team in the subject line. 

I hope to hear from you :)

That is funny and can actually hold my attention with witty banter?

That doesn't think ""u"" is a replacement for the word you? And realizes that good grammar is important?

That has a job with actual earning potential and realizes that asking that doesn't make me a gold digger?

That is not going to send me a dick pic or engage in sexual banter right off the bat?

That has a good relationship with their family?

If you are looking to fulfill some weird ass fantasy...dont waste your time. If you are gonna contact me to just keep me busy with a bunch of bs questions then disappear...dont waste your time.

I know it doesnt happen over night and dont expect it to, i am really tired of being that third wheel or doing things by myself. 

Im a career girl and at times it gets crazy. But i also know i need to find time to live my life outside of work. Im low maintenance, low drama, love to laugh and have fun. My interests are all over the place. Outdoors to indoors. More country tgan anything but enjoy city stuff too. Social drinker, non smoker. I'm 5'5"", a BBW (size 16) and very healthy. 

You...have your crap together. My biggest preference is a little younger than myself. So please....if you are in your 20s please dont reply. I promise i will delete it. Jyst tell me the basics about yourself and a pic. I am not a pic collector so no worries there.

Race is not an issue, I've never dated outside of my race but I'm open to it. NO CATFISHING PLS LOL
*****UPDATE*** 
IF YOU DONT HAVE A PICTURE OR REAL CONVERSATION PLEASE BYPASS ME. I'm new to CL Personals but I'm not desperate nor am I dumb. If you cant send a picture through email but have to get my number to send me one....and have no real conversation BYPASS ME. I'm not fixing to waste my time or argue with grown men about something as simple as a picture or a detail about you. I would like to get somewhat of a feel of who I am chatting with. Its always one that spoils it for everyone so with that being said respect my wishes, we swap pictures regardless of looks and we got to have real conversation through a few emails before I send you my number. That way no one time is wasted....ITS ALWAYS ONE. lol What a way to go trying this personals thing out.

It's funny, because all these new-fangled apps and websites keep cropping up, like Tinder and Zoosk and whatever else, but rather than making things easier, I think they've actually made things worse. People's attention spans are down to nothing. No one wants to get to know each other, they just want to fuck. Why bother nurturing anything with potential when there's something new and shiny a swipe away?

I suppose I'm an old fashioned girl in that I'm just looking for someone sweet, down to earth and funny. Someone I can have good conversations with, someone with a good head on their shoulders. Someone who is up for cuddling and adventures, staying in, going out, and fun - both in AND out of the bedroom. You know, like a normal relationship, where you spend time together, talk, get to know each other....

Maybe CL is the wrong place to look, too. Who knows? But it's worth a shot. I need a good, normal, sane man who is maybe equally disillusioned by how available ""dating"" is nowadays.

If you are between 25 and 40, have your shit together, are feeling lonely and want something more than just a hookup...then here's what you'll get in me. A sarcastic, sassy, energetic, cute and smart woman. Chubby, 27, a gamer, a geek, an intellectual, who enjoys movies, video games, cooking, being outside, live music, reading and a whole lot more. Sexy and sensual, caring, passionate, loyal, a chatterbox, a coffee addict and looking for the right guy (in all the wrong places).

Send me a message with ""Old School Love"" in the title and let me know about you! Maybe we can catch a spark that'll turn into something bigger. Your picture gets mine :)

You can't be serious does every man believe a dick pic will get them through the door???? Don't send me a dick pic because my door is closed to them.... I don't want anyone who is looking for a quick hook up or who is married... I post in all sections because I feel like it... Just because I'm on CL does not mean I will just accept anyone either... I just like CL is that such a crime?? It's easy??? Lots of people in your city... And it's fun to see what people may say... You never know who is just scrolling like I do from time to time... In this day and age people need to grow up... Ok enough of my rant..

Never know what you will get... It's exciting but addicting and I tend to break hearts... Never intentionally just people are so quick to fall in love nowadays... And if I'm not in love I will not allow you to think I am...ummm just got out a bad relationship live with my mom again my fave colors are red black and white and I have a strange addiction for joggers I graduate next year in May with 2 degrees one in computer engineering tech and a second in electrical engineering tech with a minor in naval science..

I'm not entirely sure how to word this. I wanted to be married. I want stability. I want commitment.

I'm currently in college but I feel a bit lost. Something just doesn't feel right. Like this isn't the path I'm supposed to following. Over the holidays, I've been spending a lot of time getting my house in order and I've fucking love it. Cleaning, cooking, running errands. Just keeping the house together. Then I thought about it and maybe I'm supposed to be a housewife. 

I'm looking for someone who wants I guess to date to marry. Someone who'll support me in whatever I decide to do. Someone who'll mentor me and care for me. 

I want kids. Somewhere down the line. If you have kids already that's fine too. 

I want the romance and the passion. The dates and thrill of keeping you waiting while I get ready. I know this is a bit scatterbrained but I'm just writing it as it's coming to me. 

If you're looking for companionship on a more permanent level email me.

I like to cook and clean (no really I do) and play video games and take walks with my kids. My favorite tv show is, The walking dead. My favorite movie is The Nightmare before Christmas.

That I just randomly threw up with some old bailing wire, burning trash, and watching the kids play at the big nice houses behind our old trailer house (because that's all I can afford after we left my abusive husband a few months back), thinking about how much I miss (and feel my kids deserve) the times where we had a nice home, a trampoline, and were able to afford trash service. After all, I served him like a King. I miss those times too. Every day my kids beg me to homeschool them, but I can't because I have to find another job (since I lost mine 2 weeks before Christmas), just so I can afford to feed them. Just reminiscing over all the good times, but learning to be content in ALL circumstances. One thing that they have at the 2 homes behind me that I NEVER had, was a husband out there playing with his kids, while the wife socialized with friends before jumping in to join. As I sit here, cold and lonely, burning trash, I am reminded this isn't forever. Perhaps when I learn to be completely content and joyous in ALL situations, perhaps then, HE will deliver us from this mess. 

Don`t really have a point in posting; just needed to vent. Perhaps someone out there has been there, and has some words of encouragement, cause I'm going to need them lol. =/

Y'all have a wonderful day. God bless =)

I know that I can easily expect several e-mails letting me know what I'm looking for is not on CL, but I like to hit all my bases. I'm looking to find someone I can build a connection with, build a friendship with, and hopefully a meaningful adult relationship with. I'm at a point in my life where I can honestly say I have what I need. I have a good job, good friends, supportive family, and a mind that has served me well so far. The thing about love and relationships is that you can't set up goals the way you would for anything else. While it would be nice to end up in a LTR, possibly leading to marriage and children, it's nothing that I can force. If I don't care who the person is, I can, as you can, get married within six month. I see it happen everyday. I however, am possibly like you, waiting for a connection, a cosmic connection if you will. I haven't stopped thinking that there's someone out there I can get to know so well I can feel him. A relationship where when we walk in the room everyone says to themselves, ""I wish I had that."" A connection so strong that we can communicate from across the room without even speaking. A bond where I can intuitively tell something is wrong with the other. Don't get me wrong, I know that this type of relationship and intimacy, emotional, physical, intellectual, and spiritual, takes time...but we can't work toward it if we don't know each other. I could conclude with the cliche personals ad info, job, likes, dislikes, hobbies, kids, pets, etc., but I won't. I can't imagine that if you're looking for the same thing I am, that we don't have something in common we can build a relationship on.

I'm fuller figured/BBW, and just now getting comfortable with that.

I love having fun - movies, music, the beach, beer/brewery tours, horseback riding... I've even been sky diving!

I'm looking for my lover, my best friend, my copilot for the rest of my life. Someone who appreciates the smaller things in life, because they really do matter. Someone who likes to have fun and joke around. Someone who won't get mad if I start a small food fight while we're baking - I mean, isn't cleaning each other up part of the fun, as well?

I need someone that doesn't mind showing affection and giving verbal affirmations that we are still connected and doing good.

Looking for someone who knows the difference between fucking and making love, and appreciates both. And also someone that can help me explore my kinky side. These are important things to me.

That being said, I'm not just looking for sex.

I don't have a specific type, per se. Here's a list of qualities that I prefer over others:
• A good sense of humor
• Family oriented
• Honesty
• Affectionate
• Sensitive
• Healthy sex drive haha

Looking for SWM, 26-42, non-smoker. Kids and pets okay.

Looking to date within New Port Richey, Port Richey, Hudson, Spring Hill, Holiday, LOL, Tarpon, Palm Harbor, and Dunedin. Anything further most likely won't work, sorry.

Kik me! GrizzlyBearGirl

Hi there
My name is Lola and I'm 35 ,I'm laid back, I love the outdoor, I like to meet new people, I'm good looking, fun to be with and I'm honest.
If i'm outdoors i'm a Happy girl, Free spirit, love to be by the water , lakes rivers beaches, camping, walks ,cinema, Bonfires all summer long,music just about all kinds of music. I like shopping and love precious stones and jewelries. I like to travel and I travel a lot cause of my work and it's fun
A good morning for me is opening up my eyes and seeing my other half with a smile ... I'm very ambitious and I want a man that is hard working. I got a small scale business I want to make a big one together with my soul mate, it's a long held dream I got to make me a complete and successful woman together with my soul mate. I'm positive and believe in hard work together as a partner to be in love and also be better persons we want to be. There is no limit to success hard work pays.
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough. I believe dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. I like to meet with a man that is successful, independent, laid back, knows how to treat a woman like a queen and also wants to make his woman a better woman not just want sex.

I think I'm posting this because I'm shy. And never said anything to a man in the mall. 

I'll admit it, I'm weird. Not creepy weird. I'm not typical for.I got my life together at a young age. (No kids, no marriage)

I don't want a fuck buddy, I don't want someone trying to marry me before.

And who people think ""my type"" is..isn't. 
Opposite to the fullest. I like to cook, I like to read. I love my job, I love advancing myself. 
And the most attractive person I've ever dated was my opposite. I'm white, blonde, ""bbw"", nerdy, regular gym goer, a few tattoos. 
He was mixed. Asian and black.
It wasn't a matter of fat/skinny, black/white. 
Mentally we were on the same level. He could play madden while I read, then we would yell at each other because we hated each other's teams. 

I mean maybe of the people who read this might understand, but probably not. Just because someone LOOKS a certain way, doesn't mean you won't chill or vibe on the same level. Like this dude that's the reason for this post. He was handsome. Looked comfy as hell. He looked relaxed. I wanted his mindset. What music do you listen to? I wanna play with your dreads. But there just simply isn't a chance in hell I would ever say anything. Because I wouldn't be his ""type"".

I.e; you never know who you're looking at.

Hello guys... Happy Rainy & Cold Saturday afternoon. Sitting at work right now, thinking how nice it would be to have someone yummy to snuggle up to with a movie after work.... but then remembered, i dont have anyone! I AM NOT looking for someone for tonight...just saying, in general...thats what i miss and am seeking... a special someone in my life. I am a genuine, educated, passionately crazy woman, with a great career in the medical field. I am down to earth, very active outdoors, loyal & trusting to a fault. Looking for a one in a million man!...probably not the best place to look, but hell why not?!? I am definitely wanting something that leads to long term, but you cant rush things like that. Im generally attracted to white / light skinned men. Tattoos are super sexy, not from head to toe, and not a requirement by any means. Please send me a pic. I cannot post here due to my job but will send back pictures on my first reply, if i have gotten one from you. Not into games, drama or bs. If you are married please dont respond to me. Put that energy into your wife and see how much happier your marriage can be. Hope to hear from you soon! -XO

Nice looking BF here. Dark skin, abundant curves.

I'm looking for something long term. If you have to mention the word ""discrete"" more than once, chances are you're too paranoid for me. Lol nobody's trying to break up families here and that should go without saying.

I am attached for now, so yes...restrictions apply.

Looking for a man who knows how to read. You prove it by avoiding some of the pitfalls mentioned below.

a.) You're not afraid to get close
b.) You're not looking for a hook up or booty call chick. If you're just looking to get your junk wet, please don't waste time for either of us.

c.) You understand mutual attraction is a factor. I'm not perfect and not looking for Brad Pitt but I'm not into really small (under 5'8-9) or really heavy men. I'm curvy with hips/thighs/decent bust (no, not huge geez lol)...so I don't want to feel like I could take a guy out with one punch either lol. 

No I don't ""mind"" white guys..I like y'all just fine, but I'm not an experiment or something for you to check off your bucket list. 

I am not meeting you tonight. If you're asking, that tells me a lot about you and why you're on CL. Keep it moving, pal.

If you're 25- 40, cute lol
decent looking, attractive, handsome or anything remotely fitting those descriptions, drop a line. I'm pretty darn cute and clean up nice so don't worry too much *wink*

I don't answer one line or non informative messages. If you send me ""What's up?"", you'll never find out. If you just ask ""Got any pics?"" same thing..I am telling you a LOT about me and what I'm looking for just in this ad so, if you respond, it'd be helpful not to ask questions already answered HERE. Same goes for men who send jackass messages, then once I respond accordingly you say ""Oh, but I didn't really think you were real."". Really?

If you send a pic of your dick you're clearly pathetic. I've seen them before and I can promise you, yours won't stand out...its just a dick. Keep it for your personal collection.

Pics get pics so please don't ask without sending first and I will happily supply.

Oh and if you think I'm a bitch just for being detailed about what I want and don't want? Its cool, just don't waste my time or yours by bothering to tell me.

Here it goes.. I've tried this before with out much luck but I'm thinking I'll try again and see what happens. You never know right?

There seems to be a plethora of men and women looking for sex and random hookups on here. I however am NOT one of them. Been there done that had my fun and I'm interested in more. 

Just a quick bit about me. I'm 34, long dark hair, blue eyes, 5'4 and around 230 so yes I'm a big woman. I guess some classify as a ( bbw ) but whatever.. I'm not trying to hide it or cover it up. I am comfortable in my own skin... I am silly, shy, kind, stubborn, and very passionate. I have some tattoos all tasteful and professionally done. I'm an only parent of one kiddo. I've got a great job, car, place of my own and I'm very self sufficient. I'm also very all natural in every way . While I am a big woman I do take care of myself, exercise , eat well, I've lost quite a bit of weight over the last few years and will continue to do so. Its a way of life now. I don't put chemicals on or in my body. I also don't shave I guess that's important to know. Oh! and I am non religious. 

I'm looking for a guy who is around my age, who I have things in common with. To me looks aren't everything but having chemistry is. I kinda have a thing for hairy natural guys but really I'm open to seeing what's out there. I feel like it goes with out saying but just to be safe it would be great if you are employed, have some form of transportation, not necessarily a car, and live on your own, or at least not with your parents. :) oh and single! That's important! 

Look... I'm not some picky, fancy, drama seeking chick. I have a quiet, simple, happy life. I go with the flow of things and try to be the best person and parent I can in any situation. I'm just looking for that person who gets me and respects me and who is looking for the same. If that's you... say hello and tell me a bit about you. We've really got nothing to lose. 

I do have pictures but I'd prefer to not post them online. 

Thanks for reading... hope to talk to you soon.

Good afternoon,
I recently moved here, and I am seeking a nice friend. I am very attractive, sexy and fun. I am outgoing and love sports.
I enjoy fine dining, traveling and shopping. I have been single for over a year now, and ready to date.
I have a three day weekend, so looking for someone to go out with. Let's chat a bit; perhaps meet later. I plan on going out to watch the game this evening.
You must be over 40 and attach a recent photo, to get my response. No three word sentence, and I am not into games. Don't waste my time!

Hello. My name is Tracey. I am originally from Ohio and so I don't have many friends and family here except my husband. We are both clean and sober and ride with a Christian biker ministry. We both have tats and I have piercings and we both smoke hookah and cigars. He is a U.S. Marine and is 29 I am 25 a stay at home mom, home maker, and currently in college. I am hoping to find people that can get along and be friends with my husband as I am with him most of the time but I am also looking for personal friends that I may be able to hang out with on the days that he can not be with me such as duty or deployment. I want to make it very clear I am deeply in love with my man I am in no way or fashion looking to cheat or add another to our alone time. We enjoy just about anything and everything and have a wide variety of interests. I of course love country he is mostly into classic rock. We love horror movies and cartoons. We have our own place in Fallbrook and often have BBQs and Bible studies. Hit me up if you are interested.

I am a 67 yr. old, extremely well-kept full-figured widow looking for a friend first that has the potential of turning into a lasting committed relationship. I have a great personality & love life. I am genuine, simple, caring, honest, trustworthy, loyal, friendly, romantic, family orientated person with a heart of gold, always putting others first before myself. I am self-sufficient, own my house & car & would expect the same from you. I have extremely high old-fashioned morals, so if you're looking for a one night stand, please move on. I'm not the one for you. I cannot deal with cheating, lies, drama or drinking in excess. 
I like walking on the beach or piers, holding hands & talking about things we both enjoy. Enjoy coffee. yard sales, thrift shops, TV/movies, breakfast/lunch/dinner, BBQ/swimming in my pool, internet cafe's, traveling, people watching, fishing, or etc. or just hanging out at home with that special person. Enjoy classic country or 50's music. Love seeing nature at it's finest...sunrises, sunsets, thunderstorms, or watching the stars at night. My only fault is smoking an occasional cigarette & have difficulty walking long distances, at times.
You must be white, not married, family-orientated & only drink occasionally, not in excess. Honesty faithfulness & communication are a must. Not into playing games. Please contact me if you would like to know more about me. Tell me a little about yourself such as age, widowed/divorced, have children, general location of where you live & where were you born & raised. Pictures can be exchanged later, as I do not post pictures on craigslist. I prefer to talk directly on the phone vs. endless emails. I would certainly love to find a great companion/special friend to share great times & our future with. At our age, life is too short to be alone. My favorite song is ""When You Wish Upon A Star"". Let's see if fate can bring us together.

Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a car. 

Experience is a wonderful thing. It enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again. 

Don't worry about what people think, they don't do it very often. 

If you look like your passport picture, you probably need the trip. 

No man has ever been shot while doing the dishes. 

Opportunities always look bigger going than coming. 

Eat well, stay fit, die anyway..... (But taking care of yourself makes the journey so much more rewarding.) 

If you are reading this, you may be closer to the end than you are to your beginning, so make the most of what's left. 

If any of this resonates with you, please introduce yourself. I won't bite, unless of course, you want me to.... 

I'm the real deal: Cute, bright, energetic, accomplished, generous, ""been there, done that""....desirous of a worthy counterpart with whom to share my feminine charms and eclectic circles of friends. 

My soul mate loves to play as intensely as he loves his work. Enjoys helping around the house, (loves tools) and providing for his lover, and is not a snob. Intelligence is hot; but a sense of humor is vital. So are compassion, tolerance, generosity of spirit. and open-mindedness. 

I'm not interested in a passive person or hanging out with negativity. I'm a live-wire and hope to encounter and woo a man with an optimistic attitude, who is passionate and enjoys self-expression. We don't always need to agree. ""Vive la difference!"" Just be willing to share your views in an articulate way and be willing to consider a situation from another perspective. 

I want meet a man who truly enjoys the emotional and physical aspects of a relationship. I've already raised my children, who are successful, contributing members of society. This is not about merging assets and security. This is about happiness and finding a comfy fit. Will you raise your hand?

Ok so yeah I'm posting on CL I know I know. Don't get it twisted I have no issues getting attention and dates just some guys only want one thing or it takes too many dates before realizing it's going nowhere and on here I can be upfront about what I'm looking for. 

So I've been single about 2 years now. I just turned 27 and I realized I'm ready for a serious relationship that leads to something long term and meaning. Not looking to get married tomorrow but just being upfront for all those looking for one night stands or FWB sorry not the chick for that. 

I've dated mostly out of my race (I'm black). Tall athletic type or the business professional. 
Open to all though 
Prefer someone older than me but younger than my parents lol. 

I'm 5'10
135 
Tall fit toned athletic 
I'm into fitness 
College educated 
Single never married no kids

I want someone to start over with. Someone who, like me, is scarred but not bitter, hurting yet still hopeful. I do not believe that you will fix me, complete me, or fill the holes in my life. I do not believe I can fix you, complete you, or fill the holes in yours. We can't rescue each other. 

I cannot give a laundry list of traits I am looking for, because I have come to believe that relationships are not about what your partner can do for you, but about what you and your partner can build together. I don't need your money, I don't want reflected status from you, and I am not assessing your suitability as a father (edited to add: I do not want children, but have an open heart if you have some). I do want you to be my lover, my confidante, my fiercest supporter, and a very close friend. I want to be those things for you in return.

I want to build a safe, warm relationship with you, filled with honesty, but with plenty of space to fail. With intimacy and closeness, but with the solemn promise to be the guardians of one another's solitude. I want to build a loving community around ourselves, and to create a space for constant self-improvement and learning. 

We can be partners in crime, and really good quiet-time companions. Let's skip down the street, try something new, have a deep conversation, and take a nap together -- preferably in the same day.

I have a big, open heart, a willing laugh, and a thirsty brain. I am curious to know everything about you, and quirks are way more interesting to me than perfection. I want to know where you have been before you met me, and I want to walk in the same direction together going forward. Take my hand, and we'll figure it out together.

I hate waking up to an empty bed on Saturdays. I am looking to change that.

I am single and looking for only one guy. I feel fortunate to have a lot of good things in my life and I am looking to find that one guy to share with.

Here is what you get with me:
1. Home cooked meals couple times a week.
2. Active girlfriend who is up for any activity from swimming to golf. Currently work has been getting in the way of my activity level, need to change that.
3. Here is a bad habit to be fair.. I am a bad sleeper, but hoping finding a sleep partner may change that bad habit.
4. Travel partner. I have lots of flexibility in my schedule. Last year I had some good trips, need to plan this year.
5. I like spicy foods. Can you handle your spice ?
6. Big fan of SF. You must be too.
7. Non smoker, would be great it you loved wine.
8. I eat meat and seafood. No picky eaters.
9. Looking for a real connection.
Surprised that is ridiculously hard to find.
10. 41 and looking for similar aged guy. 

Make me want to get to know you.

I am not looking for a hook up or a f**k buddy. I am a very intelligent woman with a great career and my own house. I am not looking for a man's money. I am looking for someone who I can share interests with, spend time with and hopefully become a long term relationship. 

I work in IT so it would be good if the man is a techy, but not essential. I am liberal so it is probably best if the man isn't a raging Trump supporter though I am open to political debates, as I enjoy them - I am very knowledgeable about politics and love to talk politics and current affairs.

I am looking for someone who is good with children (I have two), good with animals (we have two dogs plus a lot of animals), someone with a good heart who cares about the less fortunate, as I do. Someone who likes to go out for meals (I love all kinds of food - esp thai, chinese, italian, indian). Who likes to go for a drink occasionally.. who won't mind that I like to go karaoke and dancing (he can come too if he likes!!). Someone who likes to go for walk - up Kennesaw Mountain, down by the Chattahoochee river, perhaps go fishing with the kids.. Maybe go to Six Flags or White Water with the kids (or the zoo, stone mountain etc.).

I like to read and am very well read but my partner does not have to be. 

If my partner liked to do DIY projects around the house that would be good too - I am trying and failing to do all my DIY projects right now!!

I really fall for men taller than 5ft 9 with dark hair and olive skin (esp Italian) but the chemistry can be there with other guys too - that is just a preference..

If any of this has struck a chord with you please contact me.

By the way my divorce should go through this week, so technically I am not quite divorced, but we have been living separate lives for 4 and a half years.

It is part of human nature, a part of life that everyone is not going to like everything. Whether it is another person, a certain brand of clothing, food, etc... Everything isn't for everybody. It takes some of us a little longer to become mature enough to realize like that and how to handle it and expressing it.

I am a 34 year old African American woman who is full-figured with defined curves. Not only do I consider myself a classy, tasteful woman, I am also very sweet and pretty easy-going. So you will find yourself comfortable with me immediately and captivated by my intelligence on a variety of subjects.

I enjoy being around those that are very optimistic, and love being with gentlemen that have as big of a heart as I do. Not only should this gentleman have a very big heart but they should also be established, educated and confident. And be willing to take pressure of making heavy choices off of my shoulders and explore the finer things in life. Who wants to do any of that alone?

So.... How do we continue the conversation?

Hello there...I am an African American, 5'10"", very attractive, dynamic, entertaining, professional singer, who is anointed, open minded, progressive, and I love and have a passion for cooking! I am hoping I meet a man that loves what I consider to be ""real old school"" food. That means pig feet, greens, neckbones, chitterlings with hog mawls with home made chow-chow (can you handle this?). It gives me joy to serve my food to someone who loves it and shows me that he does! I enjoy going out to eat also. Would like to meet a great guy to spend quality time with and hopefully develop a lasting relationship. I am gifted in sales, singing and design. Excited and uplifted about the future. Love to travel, go dancing, antiques, aquariums, swap meets, bed and breakfast, culture, the arts, singing gospel and jazz, community service, and ministering to and with my man. I believe that your home should be your place of refuge and serenity. In my spot, you will find water features, soft music, aromatherapy, sweet vibes and sensations. It is a place where you long to be, not that you want to be away from. I have many God given gifts and am awaiting the man who can recognize and be supportive of them. I enjoy a gentleman and welcome chivalry!

You have been through some tough times in your life and prevailed over it all. It has only made you stronger and wiser. Inside, there is a void that can only be filled by having a faithful, secure, passionate and loving partner. You want someone special in your life who can appreciate you. You also know how to handle business and place God first. Chivalry is alive in my life and I am a lady that wants a gentleman. I still believe in courting. Thank you and looking forward to hearing from you...

Not looking for males but one real man with character. Do not need the one like today ""will you f___me"". I do believe after 17 days of my last post he is the one that flagged my ad after I responded ""how rude"". No not looking for sex. Looking for someone to eventually love and be loved back by. So do not need to be asked anything sexual because that is what I am NOT about right now. Been a widow for 7 years and not met anyone yet that I have wanted to have a relationship with. I am 57 so probably need for just my age and older to reply. So please those of you that are only looking for superficial people leave this person out of your games.

I am highly attracted to androgynous people, regardless of their sex. I am looking to meet some androgynous people in the area, as I have not had much luck meeting people since I moved here. I am a 33 year old masculine female (I hate that I have to describe myself that way and it does not mean that I am incredibly muscular) that does not follow social norms and does not have expectations of how people should be. I want to meet people that are beautiful on the inside, as I am sapiosexual as well. I have a quick wit and a great sense of humor. My interests include, pro football, reading, play sports, video games, biking, hiking, playing with my dogs, attending concerts/arts/events, museums, and just sitting outside talking. Emotional intelligence is of the utmost importance to me, as I am highly intelligent both emotionally and intellectually. I hate small talk and thrive on deep conversations or just sitting listening to/feeling music. As far as my physical appearance is concerned, I am mixed ethnicity with mocha skin, 5'7, broad build and stocky. I have short hair with an undercut, think similar to Ruby Rose. Btw she is my biggest celebrity crush.

If you are looking to meet someone different from the others you have met before I would love to talk to you. Please be aged 28-43.

I'm open to couples. I get along with other submissive females best, but we can talk about it if she's a switch or dominant.

I'm not new to the lifestyle, but I try to treat a relationship like it's my first in that I don't expect it to be like a past relationship. I don't have favorite activities. New things are fun. This is something that is more than sexual for me. I'd like to have other things that we enjoy doing together. 

I have blue/ gray eyes and blond hair. I'm 5' 3"" and am at the smaller end of the bbw category. I am in the middle of getting to a healthy size. Please, be supportive of this or at least indifferent to it. I have some body art.

Don't you want to feel needed? In a lot of ways I do need a man.

I have a lot of needs that need to be met, all over the spectrum. I want to feel feminine and vulnerable to actually ask for the things, time, and effort I need.

I am hoping I meet a man that loves what I consider to be ""real old school"" food. That means pig feet, greens, neckbones, chitterlings with hog mawls with home made chow-chow (can you handle this?). It gives me joy to serve my food to someone who loves it and shows me that he does! I enjoy going out to eat also. Would like to meet a great guy to spend quality time with and hopefully develop a lasting relationship. I am gifted in sales, singing and design. Excited and uplifted about the future. Love to travel, go dancing, antiques, aquariums, swap meets, bed and breakfast, culture, the arts, singing gospel and jazz, community service, and ministering to and with my man. I believe that your home should be your place of refuge and serenity. In my spot, you will find water features, soft music, aromatherapy, sweet vibes and sensations. It is a place where you long to be, not that you want to be away from. I have many God given gifts and am awaiting the man who can recognize and be supportive of them. I enjoy a gentleman and welcome chivalry!

You have been through some tough times in your life and prevailed over it all. It has only made you stronger and wiser. Inside, there is a void that can only be filled by having a faithful, secure, passionate and loving partner. You want someone special in your life who can appreciate you. You also know how to handle business and place God first. Chivalry is alive in my life and I am a lady that wants a gentleman. I still believe in courting.

I am highly attracted to androgynous people, regardless of their sex. I am looking to meet some androgynous people in the area, as I have not had much luck meeting people since I moved here. I am a 33 year old masculine female (I hate that I have to describe myself that way and it does not mean that I am incredibly muscular) that does not follow social norms and does not have expectations of how people should be. I want to meet people that are beautiful on the inside, as I am sapiosexual as well. I have a quick wit and a great sense of humor. My interests include, pro football, reading, play sports, video games, biking, hiking, playing with my dogs, attending concerts/arts/events, museums, and just sitting outside talking. Emotional intelligence is of the utmost importance to me, as I am highly intelligent both emotionally and intellectually. I hate small talk and thrive on deep conversations or just sitting listening to/feeling music. As far as my physical appearance is concerned, I am mixed ethnicity with mocha skin, 5'7, broad build and stocky. I have short hair with an undercut, think similar to Ruby Rose. Btw she is my biggest celebrity crush.

If you are looking to meet someone different from the others you have met before I would love to talk to you. Please be aged 28-43.

Will someone ride in on a white horse and save me from my life? I've always been strong and didn't think I needed saving, but in this regard, I was wrong. 

I decided to post this here because 99% of the guys in the platonic section are just looking for a quick lay. I'm hoping I might find men of substance here instead. 

I will start off being honest, I am married, and I know that will turn a lot of people off. I'm in a unique situation, and I find myself seeking unconventional comfort. I'll be happy to explain at a later date. I don't plan to leave my husband, and I would never ask anyone to leave their situation either.

So, I'm basically looking for a relationship. I know I'm married, and that's hard and probably weird, but i think it could work out. I know I'm not the only one dissatisfied with my marriage, so why can't I find someone who wants an emotional relationship? I would like to start as friends, but it's my hope that something deeper can come from it. If this sounds like something you might be interested in, I'd love to hear from you. 

I'm in the 25-35 range, Bbw, brown hair, green eyes, and glasses. I try my best to always be kind, caring, and compassionate. My life is really tough, so I have a lot of empathy for others. I love to laugh and be silly, so I prefer if you do too. I don't have many preferences, I just want to see who and what's out there.

Hi. I'm looking for a fun guy between the ages of 45-55 to become friends with first and see where it goes. Some of my interests are Concerts,Camping,Bbqing, Lake George.. If interested please send a picture. NOT looking for a hook-up.

So here we go -- Giving this a try because I think all of the profiles on dating sites are probably fake or everywhere but here in Texas. Looking for a local nice guy. 

This is craigslist so not picture is posted but I have plenty to share -- send me several of you and some stories about you. 

Widowed / Single independent 32you lady living in Dallas -- Great Shape Fit Lady -- Blond Hair. Looking for a fun guy to hang out with having a hard time figuring out the dating scene over the past year -- more country than I am city. Very active coach my son's football and baseball teams -- runner / on tennis league so very active. Enjoy bike riding around. I am highly educated and a great career. 

Enjoy country western dancing and would like to find a partner for that again.

So the drama stuff -- Widowed four years ago my husband was taken away from us in Iraq in 2012 -- I have a nine year old son that is the focus of my life. I am from Arkansas but enjoy Texas. Not really so much looking for right now for a boyfriend or husband. Not looking for ""hook ups"". I am not looking for pity or handouts. I have gone through all the stages of grief and moving on with life. My husband wouldn't expect me to sit around and hide from society. 

Any motor heads out there? I enjoy boats, quads, nascar and stuff -- Have a non-working 2009 Honda Quad that has been sitting for a few years would like to get it going so I can teach my son how to ride, it leaks oil and I have a few seals and parts that are in a box back before my husband deployed overseas. Took it to a honda dealership but they wanted over two grand to fix it which is crazy as I think we only paid like five for it new. Maybe someone would fix it for exchange of Chicken Fried steak and mash dinner followed by apple pie? Any mechanic type guys? (:

Send me a couple pics and tell me about yourself and we can go from there. It has to be more than the words ""what's up"" -- sending pics of yourself means more than just a headshot -- normal life pics

Have any date ideas? Maybe hang out -- Not huge into going to an expensive restaurant would rather go to an event or bum around.

You must have a job and be self-sufficient. I am not looking for a boyfriend at this stage just a nice guy to be a companion right now. I am not looking to take care of a guy -- no couch surfers. Age range -- 28 to 48. . .

No married guys, no divorcing guys or other guys with drama in their lives. You should live here in Dallas. No drunks, No Drug, No Cigarettes, No Cigars, No 420 / Pot -- I am not a bar / club person. 

You must like dogs as I have a very pushy yellow lab.

When I say pictures that does not equal a private parts picture of your man toy - I am not a girl that requires a minimum size equipment on a guy so don't worry about showing it off.

so this is something different I'm trying...

I've made one other post about the type of guy I'm looking for and a little about me, but the conversation fades after a week or two. so I'm thinking let's just chat as if we just met at a random location. 
I figure start with a baseline of friendship and if we get along from there then anything after should be easy, right?
I'm real and to prove you're real put the place you'd like to meet in the subject line. :-)

I am very active, sweet, smart ass and just a fun girl to be around! I am very upbeat and always smiling.. 

I'm looking for someone who is like me, that knows what it is to crave contact with another person. The hug that lasts forever the kiss that lingers on your lips. The instant smile when a text or phone call comes across your phone. I am attached in name only and I long to feel these things again. 

I am attractive and in shape and have it all together I want you to be the same. I want to spend my free time with one person who can have me on cloud 9 BUT also awaken the devil in me.

Might sound cheesy but I'm looking for a relationship and I want that whole cheesy dating thing. I'm 32 and I feel pretty old because it seems like everyone wants a one night stand. I'm not looking for a one night stand or fwb. I'm just out of a long term relationship (going through a divorce) but I'd like to start dating. I'm not looking to get married or anything crazy like that anytime soon but do want to get married again, eventually. 

I'm white, 5'9"", curvy and working on getting fit. I'm normally attracted to guys that are taller than I am and who are skinny. But I have dated guys that don't match that description. Intelligence is a big turn on for me. Lovingly correct my grammar and I'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. ;) (I might be exaggerating a bit but try it out and we'll see.)

Email me if you want to talk. We can talk for a bit and exchange pictures.

Just looking for someone who is romantic, sweet, well mannered, fun, adventurous and enjoys a good time! Someone who is very outgoing. I like tall, white, well mannered men. I'm into those county big men, who dress well and wears boots. Oh yeah lol. But I'm sure I probably won't find him on CL but it's worth a try right? I'm Hispanic, short, not skinny, but average but also not fat! I'm sweet, honest, loyal and spontaneous. I love going out to dance and go to bars. You can find me at the stockyards mostly or any country bar. Let's get to know each other! Message me and include a picture of yourself and I'll reply with one back!

Let's see, I'm looking for a MAN, someone that's loyal, reapectful, hard working, down to earth good man that doesn't lie. I have dated and I'm tired of dating and promises that never get met,I'm ready for long term commitment . I'm loyal, I'm down to earth, sweet, caring, passionate and a bonus is that im a beautiful women. I know there is a lot of fake women on here but I am NOT one of them. Im not looking for a sugar daddy or someone to take care of me although, I'm not interested in someone that lives in his mother's basement, you must have a job and a home of your own. It shows responsibility. If your my age and you're not responsible than you probably couldn't handle a responsible relationship. I am looking for my best friend and someone that wants to be their partners best friend in life, someone to laugh with, have fun with and eventually share a life together. I do have children so you must like kids and you must be ready for a future with a women. I'm only looking for someone that's ready to settle down. Honestly, I just want a damn good man. Is that to much to ask for? Lol .. If you will send a short bio of yourself and a pic that would help get this convo started and Ifor I like what I read,you may even get my number. I'm not wanting to text and email forever, I would like to meet up and get to know eachother. I'm very real. It was nice and sunny today..

Just what the title says. I'm into the country guys. I live in the city and do enjoy what the city has to offer. But what's the old saying...can't take the country out of the girl. This is so me. I enjoy country dancing, country concerts and being out in the country. Not afraid to get dirty...bring it. I am looking for someone younger than myself. Don't judge everyone has a preference. Please have your crap together, I do. I'm independent. Many interests and very open to trying new things. I'm a bbw (size 16). If you have an issue with that don't reply. I don't need or want your negative comments. Please be real and serious as I am. Open to where this may lead. Please respond with a bit about yourself and a pic. I'm not a pic collector. I'm really tired of talking to guys that say they are serious and then disappear when I mention meeting. Not into forever emails and texts. Extremely tired of the BS.

In today's society, so many women take on masculine roles. Things have gotten worse, for men and women and none of us are feeling as fulfilled as we used to. I speak from a very personal experience.

I WANT TO FEEL LIKE A FEMININE WOMAN AGAIN!!

Don't you want to feel needed? In a lot of ways I do need a man.

I have a lot of needs that need to be met, all over the spectrum. I want to feel feminine and vulnerable to actually ask for the things, time, and effort I need. 

I hope to attract someone that has been wanting to feel the strength of being ""the man"". 

If any of this sounds like you, contact me please :)

Hello there...I am an African American, 5'10"", very attractive, dynamic, entertaining, professional singer, who is anointed, open minded, progressive, and I love and have a passion for cooking! I am hoping I meet a man that loves what I consider to be ""real old school"" food. That means pig feet, greens, neckbones, chitterlings with hog mawls with home made chow-chow (can you handle this?). It gives me joy to serve my food to someone who loves it and shows me that he does! I enjoy going out to eat also. Would like to meet a great guy to spend quality time with and hopefully develop a lasting relationship. I am gifted in sales, singing and design. Excited and uplifted about the future. Love to travel, go dancing, antiques, aquariums, swap meets, bed and breakfast, culture, the arts, singing gospel and jazz, community service, and ministering to and with my man. I believe that your home should be your place of refuge and serenity. In my spot, you will find water features, soft music, aromatherapy, sweet vibes and sensations. It is a place where you long to be, not that you want to be away from. I have many God given gifts and am awaiting the man who can recognize and be supportive of them. I enjoy a gentleman and welcome chivalry!

You have been through some tough times in your life and prevailed over it all. It has only made you stronger and wiser. Inside, there is a void that can only be filled by having a faithful, secure, passionate and loving partner. You want someone special in your life who can appreciate you. You also know how to handle business and place God first. Chivalry is alive in my life and I am a lady that wants a gentleman. I still believe in courting. Thank you and looking forward to hearing from you...

Not looking for males but one real man with character. Do not need the one like today ""will you f___me"". I do believe after 17 days of my last post he is the one that flagged my ad after I responded ""how rude"". No not looking for sex. Looking for someone to eventually love and be loved back by. So do not need to be asked anything sexual because that is what I am NOT about right now. Been a widow for 7 years and not met anyone yet that I have wanted to have a relationship with. I am 57 so probably need for just my age and older to reply. So please those of you that are only looking for superficial people leave this person out of your games.

I am highly attracted to androgynous people, regardless of their sex. I am looking to meet some androgynous people in the area, as I have not had much luck meeting people since I moved here. I am a 33 year old masculine female (I hate that I have to describe myself that way and it does not mean that I am incredibly muscular) that does not follow social norms and does not have expectations of how people should be. I want to meet people that are beautiful on the inside, as I am sapiosexual as well. I have a quick wit and a great sense of humor. My interests include, pro football, reading, play sports, video games, biking, hiking, playing with my dogs, attending concerts/arts/events, museums, and just sitting outside talking. Emotional intelligence is of the utmost importance to me, as I am highly intelligent both emotionally and intellectually. I hate small talk and thrive on deep conversations or just sitting listening to/feeling music. As far as my physical appearance is concerned, I am mixed ethnicity with mocha skin, 5'7, broad build and stocky. I have short hair with an undercut, think similar to Ruby Rose. Btw she is my biggest celebrity crush.

If you are looking to meet someone different from the others you have met before I would love to talk to you. Please be aged 28-43.
