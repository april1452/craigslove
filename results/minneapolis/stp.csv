Anyone want to push the boundaries of the absurd and create worlds with words? How about spending mornings drawing together. We could make a movie. The possibilities are as expansive as our imaginations! I am just looking to expand my circle of friends and I would like to surround myself with creative people that I can bounce ideas off of and they can bounce ideas off of me. If you are interested, put ""I'm in!"" in the subject line. Any age works as long as you have an imagination. I am in my early 40's

You have given up before, yet you continue to dream, and sometimes have a look on CL. 
You know nothing is going to happen, no one is going to appear that will make you feel like you are not really different than all others. 
Perhaps you have or have had some physical issue (i.e. cancer, a broken something, etc., the potential list goes on endlessly) and/or spent time feeling so alone that even with therapy and perhaps an anti-depressant, the path seems solo in nature. 
It wasn't always this way for you. 
But when you think about it, and you have, you realize that you haven't always been the person that you are now.
And, that all of the years that passed, during which your goal was to make other people happy, did not make you happy. 
You have not been the only person on this earth to feel this way, to be wired in this way, to not be comfortable alone or surrounded by most others. 
But of course, some people like you find others. 
And, some never do. 
So, day after day, you get up, go through the routine you have in place...and then give some thought to the creative paths that seem to hold value for you: reading, writing, drawing, music...the list seems endless. 
Some days you create something, some days you don't. 
Some days you feel OK, and nothing seems to matter much. 
Some days you wish that perhaps when you go to sleep that night, you would not wake up, though only because of some higher power, nothing to do with your choices. 
So, what now? 
What if you simply find someone, and without looking for them to fix or change anything you are going through, share with them. 
What if you simply find someone, and without looking to fix them or change them in any way, allow them to share with you.
What if you put aside what you think you want, and the check list you normally use in looking for someone, and simply allow the exchange to happen without any diminishing feelings in any direction. 
What if you do this online until your perception changes, fear subsides, or until the exchange is uncomfortable and you get to stop without fear.
What if you choose to share yourself and your thoughts, ideas, writing, drawing, music, etc., without many questions being written in either direction. 
What if you realize that without the effort, you are likely to be alone forever, mentally anyway. 
Which, of course, may be fine. 
But what if life can be more interesting when someone is found that accepts the person we really are inside.
But what if life can often be more interesting when we find someone different than we are, and learn to accept them with the interesting, unharmful, and unique values that they have inside them, if they do have them.
You may have noticed, that the question marks that are patterned to follow ""what if"" in a sentence are not present.
Perhaps removing the question marks, in the way we share, is the best way to share. 
Write or wrong. (No misspelling...) It's your choice to do what you choose to do. Be comfortable. Make choices. And realize that there is a value in not simply walking into the closet in which you were born, and shutting the door behind you. 
This was not written for many to understand. 
But if you do understand, you are not alone, regardless of what you decide. 
Enjoy the day. Write if you like. Don't if you don't.

Are you wired differently? 

Your thoughts are not the same as most people around you? 

You have dated, perhaps been married, but after a while, you find that you are no longer happy. 

A voracious reader? Perhaps a consistent writer? Undoubtedly an unstoppable thinker? 

Yet, over and over, you find yourself alone, wondering what exactly is different about you?

If you would like to share your thoughts, I would like to read them and share mine.

I don't think I am alone in this perception, but finding those who share the experience is often difficult.

Perhaps it is for you too...

Okay, okay, okay...

I know that no one wants to read this, but I will write it anyway.

I can't take it. I want it to change!

Some women write interestingly for a short time, then the boring, questionable, patterned words begin. Start one way, then continue another. Put forth practiced introductory thoughts and ideas, then switch to routine daily thoughts and ideas, which rarely change over time. Respond emotionally to the thoughts and ideas you read, but don't put forth any of your own.

Why not, I ask? Don't you really have any thoughts and ideas that are yours personally?

Just alone at the moment and bored? Never had a relationship that involved any type of non-physical exchanges? Never have seen value in reading, writing, exchanging? Never exchanged without judging first, as you put no value into the desire to express anything of significance anyway? 

So you are not looking for any type of change in the way you live? You are not looking for anything less than the pattern you were taught to follow? And, this has made you so happy up until this point, that you want to continue the approach? 

Oh, I get it. I am so sorry! You know that I am only kidding! I want you to continue to be happy with your past and its repetition into your future. I'll quit writing that other silly stuff!

So, tell me again all the troubling things that you experienced today. Oh yes, then tell me that you hope things will go better tomorrow. Tell me about your troubling past in which no changes were thought of or attempted. Tell me about your old husband/boyfriend, you know, the terrible guy who didn't treat you like you deserve to be treated. Tell me how you want to meet a guy who will take care of you, and put your life back on its track to be repeated once again. 

I guess, finding that codependent man with only a physical interest in you will make it work out better for you during this round of repetition? Won't it? 

So write to me, and explain to me how getting your next relationship going and over quickly is going to finally make you happy. 

What? You don't believe me? What is it that you have the desire to share that would allow me to have a vision of what you do believe? Hmmm? Laugh, I will now shake my head and smile. Maybe you will too?

You might say that I am looking to regain the ignorance of youth that I have lost. The ignorance that once burned brightly, but that time and experience has seemed to all but extinguish. 

Perhaps we are all just creatures of habit, and once habits are set, we are more interchangeable than I would like to believe. 

Repeating the same actions and expecting the same results would be one thing, but I tend to think that Freud was right... when you set out to write a new story by using the same plot and characters as the last ... well ...expecting it to turn out differently might not put your picture in the dictionary next to the word ""sane"", assuming you use a dictionary with pictures... 

I am looking for a woman who spends too much time stuck in her head, has enough history to want to live outside of it, and realizes the difference between patterns that make sure that the kids get fed and the bills get paid, and patterns that keep us questioning, learning, and listening. I think words and ideas are exciting, and belong in the same world as that of touch and kiss. 

If you choose to write, do so with intention, and then share. Keep in mind that what is shared holds more value than how it's written. Your ability to write is not as important as your ability to think. Simply write and share, without worry about being judged negatively. 

How would it feel to put thoughts and ideas into words and then share with someone who simply takes them in, smiles, and shares thoughts and ideas back? It's a great big world so make your mark, assuming you have a mark to make! You don't really have to spend your entire life alone inside your head, do you? 

What have you got to lose? And if you know the answer, simply share it and see how that feels. You may be surprised.

Do you want to have a party with the King of kings? His name is Jesus, yes I said Jesus. Everyone hates that name but it's only through that name that all will be saved. You can run away from that name but no other name can save you. At the mention of this name even satan will bow down, no-wonder many don't like it. If you don't like the name there is a demon living in you. We are in the last days and there is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Signs and wonders are about to become normal. Do you want more of God's glory, his power, miracles? People are tired of church because there is no power there anymore but only good old story telling. We need to hear deep things of kingdom not what we have heard over and over. His revelation is progressive not a dormant one. Things are about to get tough in the world and only those that know their God will be able to overcome. If you want more God hit reply for more info on our meetings.

Thanks.

Things are getting worse here in United States. People are becoming lovers of themselves, having form of godliness. Depression, anger, divorce, madness and any other sort of evil that we never expected to see soon. You can't even trust your neighbor, family, friends anymore!!! Where is God in the midst of this? does he really care or exist? why does he allow all this if he is all powerful God???? Well, there are evil forces that we can't see with the physical eyes doing most of this. We are serious Christian women group that meet together once a month, to learn very critical things that need to be addressed. We want God for ourselves,Worship Him in the Spirit and in truth. In our meetings we have seen many people healed from different sickness, delivered from demons, depression...etc. If you really want to meet God and hear from Him, this is the right place. We love to worship God and soak ourselves in His presence. I am excited to hear people that are disparate for the move of God not games. Days are gone when they told us God did this and that, we want to see that happening in our present lives. Hit reply for more details.

God bless!

I would like to personally thank you for fucking up so much that society does nothing but think ill of us. MY FUCKING GOD!

Also I would like to let you ladies out there know that not all blk guys have multiple kids with multiple women. Or sit around all day and smoke weed. Or cant possibly have a genuine conversation!

So can anyone answer this question??? Is it truly impossible for two people of the opposite sex to be friends? Why must women seek out gay males for that? And why can't us men truly enjoy the art of the conversation with whoever? Let's be honest, if my wife saw me at a table, even at work with a complete hottie; being her friend would be completely unacceptable. On the flip side, for you women who say "" maybe she's not secure in herself"", if u saw your husband talking in the same scenario day in aand day out you would f-ing flip or at least question the situation until it stopped.

Yes, guys are the same . we'd also question the hell out of the reversed situation. The sad part is I used to have tons of friends both male and female. As life has moved on, those female friends have been replaced by more male friends. It just made it easier at home!!

So I pose this question: for those of you even capable of being honest with yourself........ How would the ""friendship"" scenario I threw out there work in your world? Would you question your other halfs conversation time with her??? I know u would so I guess the real question is why?????

Why cant adult men and women (especially married ones) have a friendship??? Phone chats, coffee, workout stuff etc etc. You know, the same stuff I do with my male friends daily.

Hello there! 

Little about myself--
I'm 19 years old turning 20 by end of this month (March 31st). I'm 100% Asian-American.
I had some college experience and now working as an assistant teacher at a daycare.
I work full-time and most of my coworker is female and so is most of my friends. 
Although I rarely get to see my friends because they go to school outside of town. 

I really don't know how else to make new friends other than going to school or going to a bar (which I'm not legal anyway haha). 

I don't mind having friends who are girls but I thought I should make male friends around my area.

I'm very social, funny, outgoing, caring, and honest. I love to go out and explore twin cities, drink coffee, eat out, and watch movies.

I want someone who has humor, be my buddy to hang out whenever, not be too shy, preferably intelligent and around 20-30 years old. 

Please e-mail about yourself, what you do, your age, and if you want pic please send me a pic of yourself.

Thank you.

Hey y'all. Spring is on its way, and quickly.

Dealing with a lot lately, and much of it all at once. Trying to juggle multiple things and mutli-task. Something that I've never really quite mastered. I've lost a lot of confidence in myself as of late when it comes to women. I've had a lot of failed relationships and it's left me questioning my self-worth, and what I'm worth to someone else. I feel somewhat abandoned in life, and just want someone that has a caring and warm heart to talk to. I live a very unique life that seems to turn many away without giving it the ""old college try.""

I live and cope with Severe Depressive Disorder from both genetic inheritance, and from emotional abuse (bullying). I also cope with having Anxiety, and High Functioning Autism. That said, I feel pretty regressed emotionally. It leaves me feeling awkward and identifying as younger than I really am. For health reasons, I live what's called ""straight-edge"" meaning that I don't drink, smoke, or do drugs.

I just feel very alone and need someone that I can call a good friend; one that I can trust to be there, and never hurt, betray, or abandon me. 

Please be non-judgmental and open to alternative lifestyles, and perhaps someone ""kink-friendly"" or at least understanding that I wear diapers. I have a lifestyle that might not be ""friendly"" to some. Nothing illegal....just unique and often misunderstood, or misinterpreted. If curious, please ask for more information.

I am optimistic that spring is coming. My husband and I have a home in the northern St Paul suburbs with over an acre of land on a lake. I like to garden, my partner not so much, and so it falls to me to maintain the landscape. We have a service for the lawn but it is still a lot of work in the rest of the yard, especially now in the spring. We used to have a friend who lived in an apartment who would come over to help because he missed the chance to be outdoors and work with the soil but he moved out of state. So if you are living somewhere where you can't garden and would like to come out to relax and garden, we'd like to hear from you. Pruning, weeding, dividing, planting. Also opportunities to swim, canoe and fish while you are here. Half the garden is a woodland garden, the other half has more sun. Mainly have perennials. Would be open to giving you some space of your own if there is something in particular you would like to grow. Deer, however, can be an issue. We are in our very early 60's but are open to any age.

I practice believing I know nothing, more precisely. That doesn't mean I lack knowledge, or flick matches at my grey matter hoping to ignite a forest fire. I'm referring to the bigger picture, the larger questions we have in life, and my rejection of the human tendency to concoct bullshit explanations and believe them.

If that makes sense and you're intrigued and/or practice life similarly, call me. Wait, I jumped the gun, sorry.

You probably have a good idea already whether you and I are the elements for a blossoming friendship to be, but I should probably divulge more about myself, my interests, and what I'm looking for just in case ;).

I'm single, 37, and have no children. I have no skeletons in the closet; I don't even have a closet. I'm not interested in meeting married folks, unless you and your partner have a real trust and understanding with each other. I don't need any jealous husbands or wives looking to juice me (OJ). I'm tactfully honest, open, and forthcoming, and have no interest in meeting those who are deceptive, secretive, or even private to an unhealthy degree. Oh, and habitual naysayers should click their back buttons immediately and consider locking yourselves indoors for good. Think porn, lots of porn.

I'm truly looking for friendship first and foremost, and not partners, sexual or relationship-wise. I am not opposed to the possibilities nor will I deny any attraction, but it's not my intent. Don't mistake me, I fully appreciate and embrace my animalistic qualities, but I'm led by what's above my belt-line. I'm seeking female friendship for that very reason as most men are not, and I can't relate. And, at this juncture I could use more feminine perspective.

My first love is laughter. I find no greater pleasure than laughing with others to tears. My ideal death would be from a shortness of breath in the midst of an uncontrollable guttural laugh. Likewise, I'm a character and a comic at heart, and much of my creativity comes in comedic form. I love to make people laugh. I write comedy to entertain myself.

I appreciate many forms of art, but especially music and theater. I enjoy a full spectrum of musical tastes, like Metal, Opera, Electronic, Ambient, and plenty more. Jazz and the Blues generally make me cringe. I'm on a massive Power Metal kick at the moment. When driving alone, I crank it up and do my best to hit the high notes. 

Here are some other tidbits, rants, whatever you want to call them about myself to help paint the picture:

- While I love comedy, what I'm actually best at is generating ideas in general
- What I'm worst at is listening when I take no interest in the subject
- I'm a humanitarian at heart who regularly takes exception with humanity
- I'm somewhat of a loner since most of my friends moved far away to Facebook, and visiting would be costly
- For money, I'm a web application developer. I enjoy it enough, but I would happily torch my meal ticket if the internet died tomorrow. I know too much, and it's a fucking mess 
- Watching movies triggers a narcoleptic reaction in me, and I'm rarely interested. Personally, finding the diamonds in the rough soaks the life out of me and isn't worth the effort. My favorite movie is Kingpin and if you find that more laughable than the movie itself, watch it 100 more times
- I watch little television, but on occasion do find a series that's intriguing. The writers of Orphan Black stole the plot from my brain, I'm not sure how. . .
- I enjoy reading books that challenge me to expand. Recently, I've read or am reading World Wide Mind, Falling Into Grace, The Elegant Universe, and Meditations
- Religious I am not (surprise, surprise), and while I can't understand, I am not immediately intolerant of those who are. I know some incredibly altruistic religious folks
- Atheism, I am completely intolerant of
- If Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton are elected president, I'm going to become a thrill seeker and put myself at great, personal risk. Then again, I said the same thing over the possibilities of Bush, Obama, or Romney getting the nomination over the years. . .
- I enjoy the indoors and outdoors equally, typically doing indoors and being outdoors. I enjoy being physical and love to bike, hike, blade, skate, and much more. I just started getting into yoga again, and welcome the challenge
- I eat well, and enjoy quality, diverse cuisine. Now that McDonald's serves breakfast all day, I'm set. Well, occasionally I stray for sushi, curry, and Italian. And Thai. And Russian. I hate McDonald's.
- I enjoy drinking coffee, tea, and wine. I rarely drink alcohol to excess, but do have a drink or two occasionally

Ideally, I'm looking to get up and out of the house more often and meet interesting, new people. While I greatly appreciate the art of writing, I'm not really looking for pen pals. Certainly, text-based correspondence is to be expected in the beginning. I fully understand that you are a woman, replying to a man, on Craigslist.

Time to go play now, good day!

Hope you are having a great day! Being incarcerated isn't all bad, especially if I hear from you it would be a lot better! I am incarcerated at a minimum security prison in South Dakota and am looking for a pen pal with a positive attitude. 
I have always been self-employed, my interests (outside of work) revolve around my three children and riding motorcycles. I live the motorcycle lifestyle 24/7 (except when I got sent to jail LOL). . .I am not just a weekend warrior! My life is an open book, if you want to know ANYTHING about me just ask. Right now I'm just looking for a pen pal, but a relationship is definitely a possibility. Relationships take time and I have lots of that since my release date is Feb 2019. 
I have lead a very interesting life and if you contact me I promise you will find my (pre prison) life quite entertaining and will also find that I am a fun loving genuine guy. . .. . .most say I am a teddy bear (with tattoos LOL)
I am currently in South Dakota (where I spent most of my life), but I find the thought of relocating appealing so don't worry about where you are living. I'm looking at all my options and am very excited to get my life back on track and also look forward to hearing from you. This is my first time in jail and am very clear that I am not coming back and realize that I need to make changes in my life to assure that won't happen again.
So if any of this sounds interesting to you, send me a letter and make sure you address it exactly the way I have written it (including your return address with your full name) otherwise I won't receive it (another one of those ""jailhouse"" rules). Some other details about me: Height 5'9"", Weight 250, Eye: Brown, and Hair: Brown/Gray, muscular.
PS One more thing, I am open minded when it comes to age (over 21 please), race or body type but please just have a great sense of humor and a positive attitude! If you can include a photo with your letter I would appreciate that! I can forward a photo to you of me . . ...just ask!
I look forward to hearing from you!

Just like the title says, this girl is looking for some new/more friends!

About me: I am a 24-year-old working professional, who has a bachelor's degree in Communications. I moved to Minneapolis about a year ago for work and have since transitioned career paths and jobs. Because of that, I didn't have much of a chance to stay connected with my old co-workers. So that's why I'm here!

Any ladies in their 20's that would like to hang it sometime? We can grab coffee, go shopping, see a movie, take a walk around Lake Calhoun... Whatever you want! Let's just hang out :)

I am open to platonic male friends but please note I amrecently engaged and getting married this summer! Long story, short: I am not interested in anything other than friendship nor will I ever be.

I'm sane. I'm real - St. Patrick's Day is next weekend but let the festivities begin today, lol.

Please shoot me an email with a little bit about yourself, why you're using Craigslist, and ""Minneapolis Friends"" as the title (So I know you're real). I look forward to hearing from you!

First off I am attatched so I am seeking an attatched black woman who wants a friend's with benefits discreetly. Save your judgement but I don't get what I want at home. You may disagree but it's my situation.

I am younger, early 30s but I look pretty young. I consider myself very attractive. I am in shape and a clean bill of health. Recently tested, do not use drugs. If you smoke weed that is no issue for me.

I consider myself to be dominant and a bit of a freak in the bedroom. I like to take charge, be a little rough(hair pulling ads slapping,) and very verbal. So if you are a bit of a freak even better. I love giving oral too. The package is nice and the stamina is great.

I find black woman to be the most irresistible creatures on the planet. Black woman carry curves better than anyone else. 

If you are interested send me an email. I know , what a surprise another white boy wants a black woman. But I'm very different from the most . Very laid back, with a great sense of humor. I will enjoy talking to you as much as playing. Witty charismatic guy with a sense of humor. 

Tall athletic, devishly handsome if I say so myself 😜

Ladies, I am not looking to offend anyone here. I am just really trying to figure something out.

I am a married male and not looking for anything other than to talk. I truly hope one woman will take the time to talk.

So, here is my question. Last night my wife and I went out. We had dinner, some wine and a great time. On the way home she told me she wanted to try something different and asked me if I was open to it. I asked her what it was but said it was a surprise and asked me if I was open to trying. When we got home, she asked me to trust her. She asked me to take a shower and to completely shave all the hair off my body. All of it. I did as I was told. When I was done, she told me to put lotion on my body. I did this. She then called me into the bedroom. When I got it there I noticed a bra, panty and garter belt set with nylons and heels on the floor. She helped me put it all on. I was intrigued as to where this was going. So I put it all on. When I was done, she called me into the bathroom. She told me to sit on her bench. I did that and she proceeded to put makeup on me. When she was done, she said there was one thing missing. She then put a really long blond wig on me. 

She took me to the living room and we shared a glass of wine. She then came over and started to kiss me. She told me she loved me dressed like that and loved being able to make love to her girly husband. We had a great time with normal sex. It was pretty amazing as she was really turned on. 

When it was over, she got up and got a bag out of the closet. It had pink panties and a pink teddy. She told me she wanted me to put it on. I crawled into bed and she snuggled with me all night. She said it felt sexy and she loved the way I look and felt.

My question to the open person out here is why did this turn her on? Are there other women out there like this? What is it about it that excites them or her? I am truly just trying to figure this out. Will anyone talk to me please?

Did you know that angels watch the us to know manifold wisdom of God? Ephesians 3:10 "" In same sense through our ministration of the gospel, we are spectacle to angels and to men (1Corinthians 4:9). Did you know, angels long to look into all this mysteries of God through the church if we are aligned to our calling? 1 Peter 1:12. It's an amazing thing to know how much God loves us to a point that even angels that live with him in heaven long for the relationship we have with God.
We are created in the Image and likeness of God, meaning, there are a lot of things that we share with our heavenly father. Angels don't iunderstand the mystery of salvation because they can't be saved. When Lucifer and his angels rebelled, God didn't send Jesus to die on the cross for their sins. Why? Only his children, created in His image can be redeemed. Wow, if only we could grasp how wide, long, high and deep is the love of Christ: Ephesians 3:18.

I'm a 24 (25 in a few weeks), single, straight, fun person. 
I often find myself home alone with nothing to do so I'm looking for some new friends to change that. Maybe a best friend can come out of this??? I have a five year old son so it'd be awesome if you had kids as well but if you don't that's fine too. He is with his dad two days a week and one weekend a month so those are the days I'm often at home with nothing to do. I like going to happy hour, I'm attempting to lose weight so gym and fitness are big at the moment, going downtown, concerts, festivals, shopping, nails, victorias secret, camping, traveling, movies, and just about anything else. I'm very spontaneous and adventurous! I'm a young professional with my own house, career and car. 

I find it easiest to add you on Facebook but of you're uncomfortable with that we can chat/meet first. 😊

Hope to hear from you!!!

Hey there. I'm 34. Married. Kids. Dog. Job. House. All that fun stuff. I'll be running some errands tonight and thought if anyone was interested we could meet up for a drink or two.

Walk with me a moment, will you? I'm married. Couple kids. Great job. Dog even. I look at my wife and I love her. Same with my kids. Even my dog. But Goddammit if I'm not bored right now. 
It's the same routine day and day out. Change it, you say. Spice your marriage up, why don't you? Been there, tried that. 
So here I am. Are there any other married women or attached women in the same bored boat as me? Let me hear from you. Let's chat. If we click, let's meet. Why not? Nothing sexual. Maybe a hearty make out session. Naaaaaah. Only kidding. Or am I?
I like to think I'm a fun guy in a rut. Help me bust out of my rut and I will do the same for you. 
I'm 34. Good looking. Modest. LoL. Sarcastic. Laid back. Competitive. Intelligent.

There is something about an affectionate, nurturing, spiritual human being who lights up the room and immediately makes you feel comfortable and is a very loving person toward others. This is somebody who is non-judgmental and who tries to find what's beautiful and unique in everyone they meet and certainly doesn't consider herself better than anybody else!! A touch of humor & wit, varied life experience, wisdom, sharing, intellect, able to truly connect, oh such important traits to offer others who also want a fulfilling life. Does this describe you? Well it does describe me, and if you would like to meet for a cocktail and find out more about these connections, and have a truly great experience that is both spontaneous and risk taking, send me your real photo and tell me a little bit about yourself. I'm a lesbian. I'm not interested in meeting couples and I'm not interested in meeting men, not even interested in meeting you if you have a boyfriend or husband ok? SorryÂ 

You can be in a place of struggle right now perhaps need a listening ear because you are heartbroken, or perhaps a safe place to vent, or you can be incredibly happy wanting to spread that around and make new friends. Either way, I will accept you and enjoy your company. If you are a person who likes to read personal ads but generally doesn't reply, perhaps you want to do that this time? LOL **smile** I have started up a gathering of single lesbians who really need and want nurturing support and friendship and just to go out and socialize and laugh together and connect. Please be between ages 40 and 55. This is a group of middle-aged women who have had relationships that last more than 6 months or a year.

I will return my photo AFTER you send yours. I honestly don't care what you look like but how beautiful you are inside. I need the photo also to make sure I am not talking with a man posing to be a woman. Hey, it's out there - trust me.

I just like to know who I'm speaking to and who I would be looking for in public - so it doesn't feel awkward. Myself, I am attractive, mid forties, feminine and in pretty good shape. I'm near the U of M area & I am an excellent matchmaker. Even though the premise of the group is not to be set up or hook up for the night, you just never know where you're going to find chemistry. Thanks

Hello everyone!

I am a single 29 year old male that is just kind of on the hunt for new and fun things to do in the next few months. I have been dealing with a very real recent bout of depression and I just want to meet new a fun people that I can hang out with regularly. Being almost 29 most of my old friends have all grown up and have got married or have families so I kind of got kicked back to the end of the line (which is totally cool just feels like ""well, shit"").

anyways, im a huge gamer, huge comic nerd, huge sci fi nerd, and... well...huge nerd in general. though I may not always look it. that being said im totally a night owl and im looking for people to hang out with in the odd night hours (im talking like START hanging out after 10pm). That's just my ""primetime"" so I tend to get quite lonely at that point.

Oh I should probably state im a smoker, but will refrain around you if we do hangout and its a huge issue. 420 is cool, just not my thing, and drinking is always acceptable, just not heavily!

anyways, we can email a bit and move to text and then see if we are cool enough to hang out, if you want. I am only looking for friends, and I will tell you why in the very first email if you ask me! :-)

Thanks!

Hi there and thanks for checking out my ad!
I'll be a bit upfront and say this; I miss the back and forth that can occur between man and woman --miss the feeling of ""can't wait to hear from her"" and so on. If that is how you feel, and you're here on CL browsing, looking and wondering, -but not quite sure whom to write to, -if any at all, why not try me for an e-mail or two, and see how things go?
We can discuss work, your odd in-laws, hobbies, etc, or .....if we start feeling a more familiar connection brewing .....emotional things that we each pine for and miss at home --or simply nothing in particular...... I'll leave it at that for now. :) And yes.... I am married if you're wondering that too.

I'm a 28 year old guy into tickling, looking for men who like to get tickled. No sexual stuff. Just harmless (merciless) tickle fun.

So, to be clear: this is serious tickling.

If you wanted to do this, you'd be tickled to the point that you can't stand it anymore. And then tickled a bit (okay, probably a lot) more.

You know the spots: Feet. Armpits. Ribs. Hips. Yeah, all the usual spots. And yep, I'm totally serious. I have a ""thing"" (read: fetish) for tickling.

Again, there will be no sexual stuff, just tickling. 

Are you interested in laughing more than you've ever laughed before? Drop me a line and please include a recent face picture. I'll respond with mine.

I'm a divorced 40-year old male. I had been married for nearly two decades. I didn't date a lot before meeting my ex-wife. So the dating scene is new--and it's changed, or at least I'm at a different point in life. I'm a gentleman who treats women well. I like to go hiking and make a picnic or cook supper and watch a movie. I'm manly, but will write a woman poetry or paint her a picture. I'm a religious man. I also enjoy physical contact. 

Anyway, I don't feel I date very well. I'd appreciate a woman's insight on the dating process and what women like--what dating should look like.

Hello people,

I just moved up here for my new job two weeks ago after I finished my military career instead of going back to VA. I don't know anything about this city, or well this region of the US at all. I have the pleasure of working nights half of the week so I sleep for a fair portion of the day.

I'm looking for anything male/female really for a non romantic relationship. Friends as people would call them. Anyone with a reasonable personality and can put a few complete sentences together I would definitely be willing to hang out with if they could show me some places to have a good time.

I do enjoy going to work out on my off days, but it usually ends up be really early in the morning, I have been reading quite a bit in my free time. Would go to the ocean all the time but not really an option here and would like some more options of stuff to do.

So send me a message with something interesting for a title if you will. Have a great day y'all.

My friends have been mostly failing me lately, so I thought I'd give this another go.
A few details, I'm 23, white, educated (have a bachelor's degree but back in school), reasonably nerdy, love music and movies. Also a pretty avid gamer, but I think that's because I don't have a ton going on in my life right now, meaning I have quite a bit of free time. Personality wise I'm mostly introverted; socially anxious, pretty shy, and overall just kind of awkward (although I've been told I'm not horrible). I've also been told I'm funny and ""nice"" but I don't know how accurate that is. I have been trying (and mostly failing) to be more social, so don't expect me to be a very forward person because I'm awful at that, hence turning to craigslist. I am single, but I'm not looking for a relationship but I'm also not actively avoiding them either. Also definitely not looking for a hook up or fwb type situation.
Again, just looking for new people to talk to and potentially end up meeting up with, with the simple hope of making some new friends. Don't care about things like age (within reason), body type, or race. Only thing I care about is that we share some interests and can communicate decently (so decent grammar would be appreciated). Would also probably be beneficial if you're not afraid to be a little more forward, because again, not exactly a strong suit of mine.
So if you think we might not hate each other, respond with a little bit about yourself and we can go from there. And if there is somewhere you want to start the conversation, I'm certainly open to suggestions.

Side note, also fine talking with other guys, but the M4M section doesn't exactly seem to live up to being ""strictly platonic,"" so I'll just avoiding posting there, although I'm guessing the M4W section is no better.

Hi, thank you for reading this posting. I am in my late 40's now and just starting therapy and uncovering this stuff. Victims tend to repress the memories quite deep. We know this happens (incest by a parent, uncle, fam. friend, older siblings, etc) much more than most people can imagine. If you were abused as a child you may very well suffer from degrees of this disorder. Do you feel uneasy a lot of the time? Like you don't 'fit in'? Sometimes conflicting sexual impulses? Sometimes display a behavior that makes you feel like it's an out-of-body episode? Seeking someone who would be interested in chatting a bit and compare notes. I am gaining a full grasp of this condition and recognize past triggers. What stage of awareness are you? Childhood abuse is very traumatic to a developing young mind and brings about a lack of a single, unified identity. I wish you well and hope to hear from you. Thank You.

Hi, I'm recently out of a longterm relationship and not ready for a new relationship (nor looking for a hookup). What I would like to find is a Cuddle Buddy to maybe just snuggle on the couch while watching a movie... could be a one time thing or could repeat, if it works out. 

I'm in pretty good shape and a decent looking guy. You don't need to send a picture or anything (again, not looking for a hookup), but please be in good shape too.

Please no smokers.

NO STRINGS ATTACHED. all I ask is that you send me a picture of you with clothes on bc not to be mean it would be nice to go with someone who im somewhat attractive too. i will send you a picture of me with clothes on so you can see what I look like and decided if you wanna go with me too between age 26-36 . Also i would like you to be single because I'm not trying to take someone woman/wife on a friendly date. I'm just looking to have a fun night out with someone!! AGAIN NO STRINGS ATTACHED NO SEXUAL FAVORS AND YES IT'S FREE you just have to pay for your parking!!

Hail there :D

Just because it is Craigslist and some folks get confused by the meaning of ""Platonic."" I am by no means interested in the physicalities a man and woman may share. I am in a committed relationship of several years and have two beautiful children! :)

If you are still here great! That said what I am looking for is a sincere time spent with someone who can carry out intelligent, non-condemning, and easy flowing conversation. :)
Other than that I don't care your age as long as you are classified as an adult, as long as you have skin I don't care how much melanin it contains, how much you weigh has nothing to do with who you are as a person by my belief, and that is how I sit with everything associated with what the eyes perceive. Not a common held stance I know ;b

Here is the hook! I am free perhaps tonight, but that is kinda short notice, Saturday, and Sunday. I would like to talk to you a little bit, so that there can be greater comfortably for when we meet and greet, as well as a degree of chemistry. Aside from friendly banter and sharing, it would be my privilege to treat you to dinner, coffee/drinks, movie, walk/outdoor chill pun intended, or other ideas you may have. Why? Because I love people, and my partner is visit her parents as she often does a few hours away whose values are for starkly different from my non-negotiatable beliefs, and therefore interact with them as infrequently as possible. I am tired of spending the weekends alone and would just like a friend to get to know. :)

Still there, awesome! Finally, little about me. I am empathetic, compassionate, erudite, cerebral, open perspective, genuine, kind, respectful, adventurous, ambitious, well humored, spontaneous, and a rebel at heart! Let's talk, get to know each other a bit and make weekend plans! :D remember my treat ;b

Will send pic/s (decent) to replies that took some time to respond with more than a sentence. Thanks for reading :)

With excitement, 

ME

Hi there! I appreciate you taking the time to read this. Hopefully you have an interest in some of the same things I do. Spring seems to be coming on fast and strong. I would love to get out and mix it up with someone.

First things first. I am 5'8"" with short hair (some grey), about 165 pounds, glasses, and in decent shape. Actually I am on my way to being in very good shape. I look good in my bike shorts. While some may see me as average I am far from that in many ways... physical and beyond.

I am the primary care giver for my younger children. Effectively I am Mr. Mom. I would love to meet someone who might be in a similar situation for activities during the day. I can also get away in the evenings with a bit of notice.

I am more than willing to share my picture with anyone that responds with a legitimate response. Last year I tried this here on CL and met some amazing people. I have a wide variety of interests and hope to explore some of those with you soon.

I know that there are a ton of men on here scamming for sex or other things. While of course I am a sexual man that is not my main focus in trying to meet someone. I am lonely and have free time during the day. I just would like to be more active and see where things go. I have no expectations and hopefully you are open minded enough to give it a chance. My friends would describe me as super humorous and someone with a bit of wit and extremely easy going.

I have an advanced degree in music performance and can make a connection with just about anyone. If you are up for some conversation and harmless flirting ping me back. The only way to find out where it all may lead is to take that first step and message me back. I challenge you to take a peek down the rabbit hole. ;)

Here is my question. I have always been fascinated with getting my belly button pierced. For some reason, I think it looks sexy and I often think if getting mine pierced. So what do you honestly think of a man who has his belly button pierced? Could you, would you date him? Is it just too feminine for a guy to have? Have you ever seen a guy with one? I can't stop thinking about it. However, I am concerned what others may think.

Can you please share your thoughts with me? Please don't judge me, just share your thoughts.

Hello

Life is too short to not have friends. Finding them is hard especially when you are older. I am looking to grow my male social network. It is also good for the spirit and for our health. 
I don't think CL is a cure all for this but it is worthy of a shot.
I am a 45 year old, gay guy (in a relationship) looking for other guys to hang out with. It does not matter if are married, partnered, single, straight, bi, gay or whatever. What matters is that your are cool, kind and genuine. It would be fun to go to to happy hours, going to games and concerts, hikes, biking exploring, sky diving, zip-lining, etc. I am up for most anything.
This is about hopefully making a strong connection and reinforcing it over time so that it blossoms into a friendship. If you need to know details up front like stats or whatever, I don't think this will work out. 

Heck yeah, it's nerve racking to meet a stranger, but you never know what can happen unless you take that chance, right? Join me and let's chat!

Drop me a line if you are interested and a little about you. Feel free to ask questions.

How do you do?

Nice to see people still read, bare with me as my spelling is horrible as well as my grammar, maybe you'll be able to understand?

The English language has roughly a million words and it takes 15 minutes to try and figure what word to use to start a sentence or for me it is at least, one of the downfalls of being a stoner.

Yep, I wasted another fifteen minutes, ahh.

We should have coffee as emailing and such is only seven percent affective when communicating, I went to a seminar, so you know I'm an expert now, lol.

So, here's the deal, I'm bad with making friends, my personality is less then stellar?

So, what I'm a smart ass and don't like things complicated.

In my early thirties, smoke cigarettes but not much of drinker, super classy, I'm aware.

Believe it or not, I help give back to the community and or society and do my fair share. (I litter )
I was kidding about the littering, btw.

Life is pretty good here, but always better to share what you have with those who are deserving.

It would be nice to spend a little less time alone, maybe you would be willing to tech me how to make a Friend or maybe you have a friend, kind of like me but not or after a Few cups of co co (or pick your poison within reason) you my want to be my friend?

let's go zip lining, I bet you will laugh at least once.

Perfuably your a sinner with some type of principle system, as I am looking for a friend and friends are for life, even if you move. Lol

This is taking significantly longer to write, than anticipated but figure it's worth the extra effort being that your reading it, :) I will be happy to repspond to those worth responding to with a picture of myself.

Enjoy the weekend, 

Bob

Did not come; I failed... going to try and keep this short as my goal is simple. I long for someone who realizes we are all human from differing walks of life to talk to. 

The other night I failed to die. Life has been rough, and though I have made it through everything I have edured, I made for my escape. My body fought through the pills and I am still alive for likely many reasons, one of which I hope is to connect with a someone as friends to be able to conversate with, share, listen, vent, and be supporting to as we go through life.

Some qualities that surmise who I am are: empathetic, kind, passionate, compassionate, erudite, honest, supportive, humorious, cerebral, communicative, sensitive to others, but broken... 

So yeah, need a friend that will be actually that in the most true way, then reply with whatever you like. I will respond and yes, with decent pictures so that you can know who you are talking to.

First and foremost I will say that this post and myself are truly genuine, sincere and legit. I am truly amazed that out of all the bots, fakes, scammers & pay site women posting on Craigslist, that there is not just one legit, sincere and genuine female wanting to chat. I am an older gentleman, but most people guess my age to be much, much younger. You are age and relationship status is not an issue for me. As long as you are not a minor and I am very non judgemental. I am very honest, loyal, trustworthy, laid back and open minded. Willing to talk about anything and everything, no subject taboo. Except for maybe politics and religion. I find them to be very boring subjects and I'm already bored. I'm not looking for a one or two time conversation either. I'm hoping to find someone interested enough in making it an ongoing chat friendship. My intention is not to meet anyone but, should we find that we have that spark and or connection to take it to another level, I would never say no to a meet and greet. I guess we could cross that bridge if and when we ever get to it. I'm just looking for someone to chat the day, nights and weekends away to make life more tolerable. My life has been all work and no play lately. So, if you are that needle in the haystack of bots, fakes and scammers, I hope you'll come forward and let the chatting begin. To weed out those low lifes I mentioned earlier, in the subject line, please put...""Legit Lady"". If I do not see that in the subject line, I will delete the message without even opening it. If you care to send a photo to put a face with the words, that would be nice also. So now I'm going to wait and hopefully hear from the real genuine women.

I am open to race and different cultures.

And therapy, even repeated times does not always work - ""Been-There-Done-That"". 
Looks obviously do not matter because this is a chat Ad, plus I am a guy who is very open-minded and does not have a TYPE. Personality, drive, zest for life, and how you express & carry yourself is more important in my book. I am also very non-judgmental. I do not believe I am better than anyone.

Big plus if you have ever done something before ""on-the-side"". Id love to know what that is like. I am also ready for someone who is ready for a plan of action or has a plan of action and you need a partner-in-crime. Life is too short.

Hello. This is going to be one of those out of the ordinary CL Ads. Title says it all.

I am looking for a WOMAN who loves to dance and is into everything from house music at First Avenue, to everyday Good music at the Front Bar in SE weekends to Hipshaker soul music DJs in Mpls & St Paul monthly. It would be Extra incredible if you are in a relationship or marriage where ""he"" does not dance and you miss dancing or you are tired of going alone (or just with your girls). I am Very Open to race and prefer Woman outside of my race.

Yes, I am real. It is Saturday and snow is predicted tomorrow. I am Discreet, African-American male, 
5 ft 7, 185lbs fun to be around, healthy, love to dance, nicelooking, open-minded, non-judgmental, and I am VERY OPEN to race and women's body types (thin, average, to chubby/curvy). 

I do not need a face pic. Feel free to read this Ad and read between the lines as well. :-)

If dancing is not your thing, please do not write. I am also not expecting you and I to go out dancing and be up on each other all night long...im open to dancing, dancing with others at the event and leaving out together even if we come seperately. Also I am not a jealous-guy, I have no problem with some nights you leave out with me and other nights you leave out with someone else or no one else.

Put ""Your Lover/Dancer"" in the subject line and describe yourself and where you like to go dancing and if you have heard of Honey nightclub, Hipshaker events, Etc.

Conventional logic would dictate that I should have already found her. Unfortunately that's just not how real life works sometimes. If your reading this, you probably understand what I mean.

I'm an intelligent, educated professional. Physically, I could best be described as George Costanza.

I love to take walks, linger in coffee shops & watch comedies. My kids are my favorite people and my first priority in my life. Really, I'm looking for someone in the same situation. Married, but not fulfilled. But there's just too much at stake to leave. I want a best friend, and to be very honest, I'd like a lover. I don't know if there's anyone on here who genuinely wants to find someone to love, but only in our own secret world. A small crack in the universe where illusion & reality meet. If you are here, you would be married & not willing or able to change that. You would be between 30 & 50 years old. Your race is not important to me (I'm white, if it matters to you,) BBW are welcome, I love curves. But no SSBBW, just a personal preference. 

Please write, I am anxious to make someone smile and laugh again.




Please put ""holding hands in a coffee shop"" in the subject line.

I don't really care how old you are. I do care that you are an experienced gym goer or athlete. That means you are probably within 20 lbs of your ideal weight and run more than a mile or at least know proper form in most weight exercises.

I dont care how tall you are or what you do professionally. I dont care of you are rich or poor. I just want a workout buddy. If we end meeting for coffee before a run or having a post workout recovery meal, I am game. I am single but am having horrible luck in the dating arena and am giving up (at least for awhile).

I workout at the ywca in uptown, but am not opposed to changing gyms if we decide we want to workout togetehr for a longer term. I have had my membership for 14 years now, so it is unlikely I am going to change gyms because we workout one or three times. I am sure your gym has guest passes just as mine does, and we could both join snap as a cheap alternative for awhile. 

Please, dont be a religious or political zealot. That really bugs me. I suppose it would be nice if you were above 25 yrs old, and probably late twenties would be a better start. I guess I would prefer it if you were at least 32.

Hey there!

My husband and I have recently come to the conclusion we have very few couple friends we can go out with!! We like to do spur of the moment going out type deals. 

A little about us. I am 24 years old and my husband is 23. We both work full time jobs and go to school but like everyone, we need that weekend break to keep us going! We have one son. We like to go on dinner dates, movies, downtown to the club or bar, or even bars in our town. We love to drink & dance! 

What we are looking for are couples who are also looking for friends to hang out with and have a good time. Even if it's having a drink at the house. A few Girlfriends for myself would be nice but even better if my husband has a good friend out of the deal. 

This is strictly platonic. If you are interested send me an email with a little about you and change the subject line so we know you are real!

Hello there! The weather is starting to get a little nicer(except today sadly), and as my 5 month old pooch and I were walking, I realized it'd be quite nice to have another dog for mine to play with as well as someone for me to converse with. I'm completely sane, 22, full time student as well. The dog park is located near Battle Creek water park, it's an off leash dog park.. so your dog should be well socialized and not aggressive towards other dogs. Age doesn't really matter to me, and neither does what you look like, but please be able to keep up at a steady pace :) 
Shoot me an email, maybe we can get together soon due to the nice upcoming weather!

I remember life before marriage. Before children. I remember longing for one another constantly. Just holding one another all night and nothing else in the world seemed to matter. I remember loving one another with every ounce of our being. I remember lusting for one another (at minimum) daily. I remember staring in her eyes on our first date and knowing, without a doubt, I was staring into the futute. I remember passion. 
And then the first child came. And then the rings went on our fingers. And then life began. A life filled with love for one another and our children. A life we we had both dreamed of. A life we worked so hard to attain. A life filled with frustration. A life filled with exhaustion. A life devoid of sex. A life without the expression of that passion we once shared. 
I love my wife with all of my heart. I love my children with every ounce of my being. I look in their eyes and know, without a doubt, I see the future. I see graduations, and weddings, and grandchildren. I see a life worth living. A life worth being proud of. But I miss sex. I miss (the occasional) moments of irresponsibility with minimal consequences. I miss lust. I miss the passion.
I have no idea why I posted. I have no idea what my intentions or motives are. Maybe this resonates with you? Maybe you'd like to chat? I'm never opposed to making a new friend, and I love to learn about other people and hear their stories. I guess if you'd like to chat, drop me a note. I hope you're having an awesome day!

Well...the category said 'non sexual' ....so depends on your definition. Here goes.....

Sincere and nice WM seeks sensual and pretty woman (size, age open) to 1. enjoy coffee and conversation and discuss anything we might wish to...freely and without restrictions, 2. sometime during our coffee dates, when it feels right....we will show each other how nice we are and will masturbate for each others viewing and sensing pleasure. We will not touch each other at this juncture of our relationship and of course no sexual intercourse, oral, etc. Just talking....discussing.....some disrobing......and expressing our sexuality to an appreciative friend and admirer. Think of it as a huge improvement on what you do by yourself. And takes masturbation to an entirely different level. Much more satisfying and meaningful. And when you think about it....not so...selfish. Nothing wrong with being selfish....it is important to focus on your needs, but your needs can pleasure someone you grow to like and admire too....and that in turn gives you even more pleasure.

Middle aged, professional, very nice looking, tall, blue eyed, well educated, white. Safe and sound. Just looking for a very creative and sensual woman to explore our mutual inclinations WITH. What a way to....go? .....and cum too!

Hi there. Thanks for reading my ad, out of the probably thousands of these that are out there. 

In short, I'm looking for someone to chat with on a regular basis. I get somewhat bored at work from time to time, and today is one of those times. Not really interested in chatting with a ton of people, or talking for an hour or two then being done. I guess I'm looking for more of a pen pal kinda thing. Let's get to know each other, vent about our lives, and be actual friends (electronically), and chat about anything our hearts desire.

Sound like something you'd be interested in? Then what are you waiting for?! Email me, and type ""I'll talk to you!"" as the subject to weed out the plethora of spam emails that I will most certainly get. Also, pick our first topic of conversation. The most interesting ones will probably yield a quicker respond.

Hi there! My name is, Liz. I just recently turned 25 and live in Brooklyn Park. 
I got to the point the other day realizing...""enough is enough"" with my weight and I really want a friend who is in the same boat as me. 
I'm obese and am wanting to eventually drop 120 lbs. I have a genetic connective tissue disorder that makes working out hard to do all of the time, and because of that I have a very hard time staying motivated and I'm very shy and uncomfortable at gyms. 
I figured if I found someone who might be in the same boat as me it'd make it a lot easier to get into the swing of things. I have an LA Fitness membership. I work evenings mostly, so mornings would be best. 
I'm self conscious about my weight, so another reason why I'd rather have a woman who is in the same boat as me.
I'd be willing to meet at the Brooklyn Park or the Brooklyn Center LA Fitness. Must be understanding of the fact I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and certain things I literally physically cannot do. But am still willing to help you do if possible. 

I know this might sound a bit much, but again I'm really wanting to take my health back and work on this. I just need someone else who needs the same motivation as I do. 

I'm not too picky on age, but preferably my age or a little older.

Yo, friendships are hard to keep track of and they change when you have kids and are married being a responsible adult and whatnot, so here I am on the blogoshpere up in your grill.

I'm happily married with two kids so no funny business unless it's the regular kind and not the adult kind.

So anyway, to business. Are you a human seeking another human to do stuff with? Like going to the mall with a grown man and his 2 toddlers? Building cool stuff or pretending to be an artist sometimes? Do you like anime, superheroes, tattoos, piercings, science, reading books in/not in the same room with other people? None of these things listed? Well then a friendship with yours truly may or may not be just for you!

So listing things is easier than trying to be humorous with everything.. Here goes.
Likes: Anime, Movies with depressing ending, building furniture, painting, drawing, drinking beers, karaoke, sincere/insincere conversations, judging people and feeling bad for being judgemental but doing it anyways, hand to hand combat, swordfighting, hiking kind of, hanging out with the family, being married, body modification, coffee.

Dislikes: Working on cars, slipping on ice, coffee that's too hot to drink, serial killers, romantic western novels, people who when asked what kind of music they like they say ""everything"", southern comfort, having always to be the one to call or text first, other stuff.

Don't know what else to say really, so. End

You are smart, intelligent, and proud. But you have your fantasies and desires -- you want to be vulnerable. You do not want to be violated and looked down upon in any way. You want to be guided with strict rules and fair demands. You want to feel desired, protected, and loved. You are extremely curious. 

I am smart, confident, and articulate. I am observant, a good listener, and patient. But I am stern, demanding, and ever pushing on your limits. I am fair and affectionate. I talk, I joke, I laugh -- I am human. I will guide, lead, protect, and care. 

We both have our lives, perfect as it may seem from the outside, but vanilla on the inside. We both crave for a little adventure, where we both will enjoy the journey. But we both are responsible adults and will know real life comes first. This is strictly online fantasy. I am not planning to meet. So, how does this work? Let's figure out. I am as curious as you are -- it is a game for the curious and intelligent minds.

Please put one of your favorite books in the subject line.

If you like to write, to converse, to feel a good connection building this way, and too, if you enjoy and feel a smile coming on when you see something in your inbox, that's what I am talking about. :)

This is the ad you've been waiting for: I'm looking for a FWB, but not just for random hook-ups. I want to be able to talk to you, flirt, have fun and laugh...get excited about each other's texts, wait with butterflies for each other's emails, wondering if maybe we went too far suggesting something kinky or admitting something really personal about ourselves. And then move to meeting when the time feels right. Do you want that kind of relationship back again? I do. So let's give it a try.

I am married, and it's fine if you are too. Basically, we're roommates, and I know for certain she's had some outside relationships. I can't really change things right now, so my thought is why not make someone happy, and find fulfillment and excitement outside, as long as nobody gets hurt? In the long run, it's better for everyone. So let's just have fun! There will be some sneaking around to communicate, but that's also part of the fun, right?

Me: I'm 41, 5'10, in good shape. I'm outdoorsy, educated, and have a good, if a little dry and random, sense of humor. Plenty of interests and ideas for conversation topics. You: surprise me! Just be someone I can connect with.

Some of us guys just need more affection than others. I think about touching and being touched a lot; usually several times a day. These fantasies are usually platonic; I can separate affection and sex needs. For some reason, I seem to need affection from men more than women. Maybe this is because of my same-sex attraction, but I don't know.

My parents almost never touched me when I was a kid. I didn't have affectionate friends either. When I was about 14, a boy in my class put his hand on my shoulder as he passed by me and said, ""hello"". It was an amazing experience for me. I had just discovered that I enjoy touch. I really hadn't even known what I was missing until then. I'm not sure how common my experience is.

I have done some research about touch, but there isn't much out there. I learned that children who aren't shown affection tend to either need a lot of it as adults, or they become adverse to it. The lack of touch can be very damaging to infants. Americans in general are somewhat affectionate, but there are places where showing affection is more common. Does anyone know of some good research?

I find day to day life really lacking when it comes to touch. I wish that people were more open to showing and receiving affection. I have to be careful with who I touch because some men are really uncomfortable with being touched. I take notice when a guy brushes against me. I have to wonder if he craves touch too. I will admit to subtly touching a guy like that many times. When I ride the bus, or I'm at a movie I wonder if I will be next to a guy that will let his leg touch mine. This is very stressful. If I allow my leg to touch his, will he quickly pull away? Will I make him uncomfortable, or will he appreciate the contact too? I'm sure that some guys hardly notice the touch; they neither like nor dislike it. If the guy seems to like the touch, I will move my leg up and down very slightly once or twice. If he does the same, it is great! If this causes him to pull away, I feel guilty for invading his space.

I studied massage therapy and worked in the field for a while. This became draining for me; I gave touch, but I rarely got any back. Not that I was expecting to be touched, I just didn't know that it would be so difficult to give and not get any touch back. It reminded me of how much I wanted to receive touch.

After I've interacted with a man several times (like at work, for example), sometimes I put my hand on his shoulder for moment. I hope that he will reciprocate later, but usually he doesn't. I never want to be pushy because I know that some guys are really uncomfortable with being touched.

I was with a guy from work last night at my place. We had good conversation, not just the usual superficial type. I felt a little lonely though because we had no physical contact. For me, good conversation with no physical contact can be lonely. I asked him if he was okay with hugging each other. He thought it was odd that I asked, but he was fine with it, and he gave me a nice hug. I think it's interesting that we have worked together for two years or so, and he never touched me until last night. We probably shook hands when we first met, but that was about it. When I was a teenager working my first job, several guys were very affectionate with me. As time goes on, it is harder and harder to find men like this.

People are very affectionate with pets; it seems that a lot of people would rather get affection needs met with a pet. I'm sure that many dogs get much more affection than I do! This is sad. Pets really do little for me. We had dogs when I was younger, but I never felt really close to them.

Sometimes I go for weeks with little affection. This really wears on me. I deal with depression, and I know that some touch would help. Affection is a great stress reliever too.

I was hoping to find some men that relate and share some thoughts with me. I'm very comfortable with meeting if there is a good connection. I hate texting, and emailing isn't much better. I'm good with talking on the phone at first, but I prefer meeting in person.

I'm a very nice guy, sensitive, down-to-earth, respectful, intelligent, very honest and introverted. I like meeting all kinds of nice people. Making new friends would be nice. I especially like real friends that don't mind helping each other (even working) when needed. However, I don't have a specific agenda. If you just want to talk about something, I'm open to that too. There doesn't have to be any physical attraction between us for us to be platonic friends, and I'm not going to refuse to meet someone just because I feel no physical attraction. If this is important to you, say so up front. Otherwise we may spend time together only for both of us to be frustrated later. I hug people that I'm not physically attracted, but it would be difficult to cuddle with someone that I wasn't physically attracted to. So, if you care, I'm 6-2, bearded, brown/gray hair, leaner than average, young-looking for my age, and handsome (your opinion may vary). I'm mostly attracted to guys around my age or younger. Again, it's more about the person inside than what's on the outside.

Keywords describing me, likes, etc: trustworthy, caring, fitness, floral design, atheist, respectful, long walks, deep conversation, hugs, personal growth, volunteerism, gardening, quietness, reflection, and lots more.

When responding, please include a pic and something about yourself. Also, let me know what you want. I will share a recent pic too. Also, change the subject line in the email. Yahoo emails end up getting grouped together by subject, and it can get very confusing.

One more thing. There are men on here that post ads, and they clearly aren't interested in platonic friends. Please help to clean these ads out. Open the ad and click on the ""prohibited"" link at the top. If several people do this, the ad is removed. Thanks. I hope to hear from you!

I have a passion for sensual bondage and would be interested in meeting a friend I could practice with and better improve my skills, better map out S/M scenes and overall improve as a Dom.

Does anybody still use yahoo messenger? Would like to share time just chatting about anything. I am emotionally available and committed to personal growth. However, I am also a poet. In order to maintain perspective of the human condition I am somewhat detached from it. Socrates quotes ""To have a penis is to be chained to a madman."" By default my ideology, as a translator, precludes its own interaction in MY life. Therefor I have posted as strictly platonic. I believe that I would make a good friend. I am not crazy yet I still believe in love and as Plato says ""Love is a serious mental disease."" I believe that true friendship is platonic love and that's what i desire. Perhaps it's a step out of the clouds and into the worldly to desire. Yet the heart beats blindly with the memory of love. In the world yet not of the world, mayhap we all have a serious mental disease from the beating of our hearts. I am emotionally available and committed to personal growth and would like to share time just chatting about anything.

Hi there, I am looking to make some good friends. Hoping to chat through email/text/facebook for a bit before actually meeting. I have every intention of meeting within a couple weeks, so please be serious about it too.

A little about me; I'm 26 and moved to MN almost 8 years ago. I love animals, have a few pets of my own and would definitely have more if I could. I try to do as much as I can out with my two dogs. I like to explore different parks, go on walks - I really think I would like hiking, but haven't actually done it yet. I'm a little artsy/crafty, I like to make things. I used to draw, still write a little bit and like to read. I'm into photography as well and like underground rap mostly for music but listen to almost anything. Also love piercings and tattoos :)


Let me know if you're interested and we can go from there! Please send a picture and I will reply with the same. Thanks!

After reading ad after ad on Craig's List about individuals seeking to find a relationship offering meaning, contentment, or an opportunity to be spanked by a dominant transgender nun, I have decided that all I really want right now is a pretend relationship or virtual ""fling.""

The benefits of a pretend relationship/fling, lie in being able to communicate (via email only) with another individual about things that are not actually occurring in one's life. It's the incredible chance to be completely dishonest with another individual who wants nothing more than a beautiful pretend connection with another soul.

We needn't share photos, real names, or accurate personal data. I will never ask you to call me, meet me, or send me your bank account routing number to help a deposed Nigerian dictator who will pay you back in millions. I just want to have a deep, intense relationship that has no actual roots in reality.

To be my pretend girlfriend/fling, you must be exceedingly intelligent, articulate and edgy. Your sense of humor must be phenomenal -- I would never pretend date someone who was not incredibly funny. You should be quite beautiful with striking features, (though I will never really know if it's true). It's essential that your mastery of English includes proper spelling. I will pretend break-up with you in a heartbeat if you make lots of typos. That's a major turn off...

I am, of course with this being pretend, a really bright, very good looking physician, who is coming off of a very painful, faux break up, so I might be pretend rebounding right now.

Potential pretend girlfriends/flings please note: I will not respond to any replies that include photos of your penis. (I don't expect any such replies, but it seems like that's what everyone writes at the end of their ads...)

Hey there Ladies!

Okay, I realize this request is extremely specific and maybe a little unorthodox, but what the hell, it's Craigslist...right?

The short version: I love working out, I am big into fitness and neither my wife (yes, I said wife) nor my friends share this passion. The adrenaline, the feeling of accomplishment and the excitement that this part of my life brings out needs to be celebrated, it wants to be fueled by someone else with similar goals and experiences. My wife and friends do not understand and frankly don't want to talk about it. I guess I am kind of looking for a BFF (best fitness friend). Someone to help push me, someone I help to push. Share successes, failures and someone to keep each other on track! Maybe we work out together, maybe we just root each other on, maybe someone to say ""get out of bed and get your ass to work!!!"". I think these feelings and these experiences need to be shared and celebrated and what better than someone experiencing the same thing, maybe needing a little help and just excited about being healthy???

So, why am I looking for a woman you ask? Well, let me say this up front. I am looking for nothing besides a BFF and this is a totally innocent platonic post, however, working out and fitness comes with some excitement and tension I thought I could be exciting to share this with someone that these feelings could simmer a bit. Because this is innocent, I don't care if you are married, single, engaged...whatever. Just looking for someone who shares my passion and maybe looking for a partner to share it with.

I don't need to share pics, but am far from afraid too if you are interested. Let's start with talking about our goals, our routines and maybe try to help each other on where to go. Maybe we email each other just once and we move on with some good ideas, or maybe we text every day helping push each other to the next level and maybe even work out together. Cardio, lifting, intense, laid back, I am open to anything. 

If any of this sounds like something interesting, send me a line and let's chat?

Thanks!!!

Or would it be Spousal-Attention-Deficit-Disorder? Hmm?

So why the ad you ask? Simple, I got to thinking that I might as well chat with others that feel the same way - that just don't get the attention they deserve from their SO. I have heard that this is a great place to look. Some say there are more than a few of us here.

I hope to hear back from someone who is inquisitive, open minded, educated, smart, well-read and yes, you guessed it - married. You should have a playful sense of humor, and a little sarcasm can go a long way as well. I am open to making new friends if nothing more. 

If you're interested in getting to know me, you would have to like good-looking guys that are smart and funny, have a lot of energy, honest (other than the obvious), confident, and have been known to be a little bit naughty. I have a nice smile, brown hair, blue eyes, I am 5' 10"" 180 lbs, I work out almost everyday and I think I look pretty good for an old guy (39)!

Tell me a bit about you, your looks (be as descriptive as you can), your situation. How long have you been married? How long have you been thinking about looking around? Have you done this before? What city do you live in? I understand the need for discretion, so if not the exact city, one that is near you. Also tell me something that I would find interesting about you.

I am available to chat over email most days while I am at work, and in the evenings after my wife and children have retired for the night. We are getting ahead of ourselves here, but I thought it should be mentioned that I am able to make myself available in the evenings when needed.

Let's get this party started!

Hi, I don't know your situation or your reason for checking out these ads. Maybe you are bored and just get a kick out of how corny, rude, silly, nasty most of them are. Maybe you just need to leave reality behind for a bit. Well hopefully here's one you might consider answering. 

Like you I'm not here looking for love or drugs or used undies or nakid pictures. I'm here hoping there's someone out there who's not looking to change their situation but is missing the excitement of someone new. A reason to look at your phone, to get excited about the next email, your next thoughtful email gets a thoughtful response back, and the next meeting ... the butterflies that thought will bring. Maybe you've been married a long time and the thrill is gone maybe your husband/boyfriend hangs out with his friends more than you like. Whatever the reason (I can give you mine) if you'd like to e mail a bit with someone new. Someone you would have never met ... then give it a try. If we don't click nothing lost.

Hope to hear from you.

So here it is as best i can explain it...i do in fact exist im 38 white and possibly the most repulsive thing ever roam this earth. God gave me the gift of mechanical understanding but it came at the cost of being socially retarded (its difficult for me to interact with people outside of the requirements of my job) im not stupid or a pussy although a pacifist i will only back up so far before i react in an unpleasant manner (usually to the point of an over thought extream) .i know that no one could love me and would ask not that as i have not the credentials to ask anyone to feel anything for me ( even if they could they'd still have to want too) im painful to look at and i suspect unpleasant to be around i dont feel much anymore but what i do is felt with more depth than most people put into their lives thus the pain caused is greater resulting in a decreased desire for me to attempt interaction with women i am in fact socially incompetent as i have never been able to know if anyone liked me or no one ever has this has made me wonder as to what it would be like. This doesn't matter though. ..what is if importance is if you are curious or compassionate enough to willingly suffer the indignity of being seen in public with me and most importantly would you tell me honestly what you notice to be inadequate with me so i can attempt to rectify such defences im not fat but i am not nice to look at. I can honesty claim to have the ability to sufficiency repair any machine as required to return it to service but i dont know how to ask for a date and dont know that i have the right too as it would only create an awkward moment tell an escape was found creating an comfortable situation for someone because they of no fault of ther own i felt necessary to approach them. so i dont. i might be that retarded cat that everyone gawks at but i got more shit trapped in my head then their lives will allow them to understand intelligence is not easily perceived my job currently is to reconstruct machines to do things the designers did not intend them to do this comes naturally to me as a gift from god but the most basic of human existence eludes me id like to know the reason for this complication that is such a great obstacle in my quest for a happiness if you want to meet me id know that no possibilities are intended and i expect nothing in return so if something like boredom or morbid curiosity would draw you to subject yourself to interaction with me id be happy to take you on a date for as long as you could stand it hoping you'd tell me where/what/how i failed before you run off this would be appreciated as i can not seek for change if i dont know where to begin

So here I sit, totally bored and I decide to look at the ""men seeking"" sections. I know that CL if full of more dudes than women, but after looking at the ads, I know why now! The amount of guys showing their dicks, or bodies, or talking about what they would like to do freaked ME out, I can only imagine what women think! What's worse is, I'm sure there might even be chicks that reply to them!

So should I be posting my dick on here, or putting a pic of me in a dress or something to get women to reply? Maybe I should be saying how much I want pussy? Don't get me wrong, I have plenty of kink, but I'm not going to go post it all publicly for everyone to see!

Here's the deal. I'm bored, but can't sit here and laugh at the weird dudes on here anymore. I'm normal, good for a laugh, and won't send a dick pic or anything like that. Send me a message, change the title to whatever...I don't care what to (so I know you're not phishing). Let's be friends! Let me see if I can make you laugh without being a freak! :)

Hi,

Thanks for visiting the Ad. I am not a frequent visitor to CL, but currently in look for a friend or a online chat partner to just talk about anything and share/discuss our interests, while respecting each other's limitations. I am a married male, 30 yrs, of height 5'10"", with average body and no habit of smoke / drug and disease free. Would love to exchange emails and see if we like having conversations and take it forward. I do not see our relationship going beyond than being platonic. Even if we develop, I guess we all know to remain as friends. 

Also, I am of Indian(sub-continent) origin with wheatish color. I know few are sensitive about Race, appearance,etc... and have their own preference. If you are still interested, plz free to respond. I guess, with no luxury to buy time, let have more experiences and create memories with the life we have. I have no preference on race, color/appearance... just be interested to have a meaningful chat. I work weekdays with evenings and weekends being free. Please email me with your pic. Shall do the same with a pic and number upon your response. 

Have a nice time and hopefully sunday's forecasted warmer temperatures sticks on through out the week

Hello, 

I'm an attached male that is in a relationship that is lacking passion and desire in the bedroom and am also lacking a strong emotional connection. 

I'm looking for someone to connect with both emotionally and physically. I want to feel the energy, a spark, passion, friendship and drama free fun!

I promise not to judge your situation if you don't judge mine. 

Safe and discreet. Please be the same.

It is nice to be appreciated and see that twinkle in the eye...isn't it? Or am I alone in this thought? 

Would be nice to share coffee and conversations with a special lady and see that twinkle...again. 

Being just 'friends' allows for the conversation to be broader and in many ways more fulfilling. Outright sex tends to inhibit things. Strange but true. 

It is nice to just appreciate someone without going any farther. What can I say....I must be easily amused? Maybe not though. There is something very full filling with not getting what you THINK you want and finding that not getting what you want opens up ways of feeling and appreciating what you do have or think about. It is kind of like looking at the chocolate bar...Yum.....Okay....now go ahead .....savor ...unwrap ....hold in your hand...then mouth....slowly....let it melt and feel that huge overwhelming sense of chocolate heaven? Sure you did and a hersheys (let's be patriotic) wasn't even in sight! Ahem.....are you connecting the dots? Yup....same can be done with 'whoopie'. 

My ideal box of chocolates looks and acts (you know chocolate comes in all sorts of sizes and shapes and personas....bunny rabbits.....and god knows what else!) is as follows:

She is pretty smart, brainy, a reader/bookworm. Young 20's ...30's. Brunette. Brown eyes. Pretty face. Fair complexion. NOT SKINNY. On the plump or more side. You like to use clothes to set off your feminine ways. And can say a lot with just her...eyes.

Okay fair is fair. 50, but young 50, WM, overly educated, very nice attractive appearance. Tall, blue eyed, nice skin, teeth, hands, etc. I am very well domesticated ( I bet that might be part of the problem?). Medium build and super clean and safe. I mean I would make Howard Hughes look dirty! Now there I just really dated myself. 

Do you like to flirt and be appreciated for all of you and keep your clothes on, too? Get that warm buzz feeling from head to toe? Be on the edge of your seat just alittle and enjoy getting alittle extra attention for YOU....not for some magic you perform in your daily life.....you know....for the boss or customer....or family.....that was a great sale....you performed that well...nice dinner and love your apple pie. All that is nice but are YOU a sale? A tax collection unit? An apple pie? 

Come on you know what I am talking about. It is pretty basic...human ...need. Or am I alone in this feeling?

Hope not.

Enjoy the Spring. And remember...it's later than you think!

Please don't respond if you're over 45. I need some friends and it has worked pretty awesome for me here before so here I go again. Where did they go you ask? Good question....not too sure, but a few theories:
Their baby momma drama took over.

They were overcome with guilt about kissing me because they had a girlfriend.

They thought I was falling for them.

They were on house arrest.

They need to lighten up and stop trying to use their brains.

I am annoying and/or a meanie.

Here's what I need. Someone cool to hang with who isnt going to get all dumb with the mind games. Not afraid of a flirty kisser and most of all....you have to be able to make it past meet up number 3....it can happen. Let's be creative. Jenga at the park, fly a kite by a lake (kites are now being sold in stores, exciting) look at the stars by a fire, and since it will be out nice soon why not golf intoxicated .... so you don't notice how horrible I am, or talk about my garden game plan... See..we can do it!

Replies with more than a ""hi"" and a pic will get first priority. I will return with the same. Share your age and loc in subject. Let's make it as easy as possible. 

I have above average personality, moderately over my ideal body mass index, but pretty dang cute... Let's make tomorrow fun.

I'm looking for someone to join me on the occasional cross country flight while I'm shopping for my next plane. My current plane is a 1967 Piper Cherokee 140. It's a small 4 seat airplane nothing fancy (see picture).

The trip will vary depending on where the plane is. For example, I saw one in the Chicago area, the way there was about 3 hours 20 minutes. The trip back took just under 5 hours and I stopped part way for lunch. The trip could have been longer or shorter each way depending on headwinds. 

I'm looking for someone that enjoys flying in small planes and likes to talk about whatever. I'm planning on overnight stays, not looking for sex, just company. 

Weight does matter for aircraft limitations (and size those things are pretty small inside) but there is room for 4 total so if you have a friend or two that wants to come along they would be welcome. Combined passengers must weigh total 350 pounds or less. I can land at nearly any airport to pick you up on my way. 

Notes- I'm not leaving anyone anywhere, not a taxi service, not picking anyone up. No alcohol, drugs or smoking must be clean in general. 

About me, I'm 34 nearly divorced (it's complicated) with 2 wonderful kids ages 10 and 12. I work nights on the weekends and have 4 days off each week. I love flying, and the outdoors, lots of other things we can talk about too. 

Texting is awesome@ 2one8-eight31-seven122 my name is Derek send 'Copilot' so I know you are people. 

P.S. If you can't make a flight like this happen, I fly into Duluth a lot in the evenings (usually pretty late) that might be another option. If you think this sort of thing sounds fun feel free to text me and maybe we'll be able to meet up some time to fly somewhere.

Hello and happy almost week over day. If you are anything like me, you are struggling to get much accomplished at work today so that is why you are killing time on CL reading my post.

Basics here. 32 year old married man with no dreams of changing that. 
But as we all claim, women get along better with men and men get along better with women. 

I used to have a decent amount of lady friends but the wife didnt like them so we kind of last connection. 

I would love to find a great gal who is looking for platonic only. We can text or chat the days away. Maybe sneak out for a walk or a movie on nice days. 
And of course this gentleman would love to hit happy hour for some giggles and drinks.


If I havent bored you by now and you want to learn more please send me a message and lets chat.

Are you between the ages of 30-45, married/attached, reading this at your office, thinking about all the nut cases on CL and if you could find a Gerard Butler or Javier Bardem for a passionate romance and affair? You are unhappy or dissatisfied at home but don't see yourself ever breaking it but still want some moments of pure happiness and some love and affection you deserve. Or maybe, like most men, you too can't find satisfaction from sex with one partner for the rest of your life and like to fantasize about other men. You have talked to men on CL before but some were too pushy, some were weird, some were unattractive, and some seems promising until you learn more about them - essentially you have not had success in finding the man of your fantasy here. But you are still here, either you are addicted or find this thrilling, or simply because there are not whole lot of options for a married man/woman to flirt and cheat without risking the home. 

Well, let me make a case for myself now. I am certainly not a Gerard Butler or Javier Bardem look-alike :-) (if you find some here on CL, I would say there must be some BIG reasons why they are here). Now that said, some do find me charming, funny, witty :-) I am 37, married, and I live a very normal/boring life and looking for some excitement. I have exchanged emails/fantasies with women previously here on CL but now I want to find someone with whom I can eventually meet in person. If you consider yourself a normal person - then I want to hear from you.

I'm always fascinated with the human condition - the things we do, the things we choose to believe... and the cognitive processes behind that, from genetic predisposition, to environmental influences.

Few things engage me like a great conversation. Unlike some, I value differences in people, and would much rather interact with someone who is different from me that similar.

So pick your poison: politics, sex, religion, self actualization... But if you have a position, I expect it to be an *educated* position.

I am an artist and have drawn plenty of nude models but I have always wanted to try modeling myself. Ideally I would love to end up modeling for a class, but I would like to test the waters out with someone first. I'm not looking to be paid for my modeling, just to see how comfortable I am with it. You don't need to be an amazing artist, to be honest this is more for me to practice poses. Also, if you wanted I would be happy to draw you also, clothed or nude. Taking turns modeling and drawing would be pretty great I think. I have a couple roommates so setting up a drawing session here would be very difficult, so we would most likely need to set up at your place or a studio space you have access to. 

I am 28, 5'9"", a pretty average build. I have a masters degree in visual arts. I'm intelligent and respectful.
*The image above is not of me. Obviously, having never modeled, lol. It is more to show perspective artists what I am hoping to do.

Honestly, I'm looking to talk about things that people don't normally talk about with their friends. I'm not judgmental and I am looking for someone else who is not judgmental. Does that make sense? I'm married with three kids, so I'm not looking for something beyond email.

I'm generally recognized as being really smart -- I'm certainly educated up to my eyeballs -- but I'm not arrogant about it. I like learning about new people and new things. I would prefer that you be intelligent, if not college-educated.

So i just received my 2016 Entertainment book with all of these restaurants coupons but the problem is most of them are for buy one meal and get the second free or a certain amount off the second one.

Hi. This is a longshot. I'm trying to find my friend chris. Your a cpa who has a little boy living in Iowa . You drove a sup up Honda that was black with green trim. You and I started a friendship. We use to meet at the dairy Queen on main street in anoka. You came to my house in anoka a couple times. We fell out due to a comment that you made that at the time I took wrong. I never got a chance to tell you I'm sorry at the time. You even have a Russian blue cat that loves to sleep on her back. You have the coolest crotch rocket I know. If you happen to see this just know I'm miss our friendship quite a bit and regret the argument we had. You were going through at the time your stepdaughter being sick. If you know who this person is or chris if you read this, know I'm very sorry and miss my friend terribly. This is steve from anoka. I hope by chance you read this.

Hey there. I'm reaching out to the universe in hopes of finding someone I can share certain consciousness-expanding experiences with :). 

I find that I prefer feminine energy with these types of experiences, but I sincerely wish to keep it platonic as I just got out of two relationships in the past 6 months-- they're too taxing to maintain at this point in my life. I'm a damn good friend though.

A bit about me:

I'm attractive (legitimate male model/actor) and fairly intelligent with a witty sense of humor. I have a passion for learning the arts and creative expression. I read, draw, paint and work quite a bit.

I guess I'm just reaching out to find people who I can share new adventures with whilst forming a bond. I have great friends, but they aren't into some of the things I am, hence my posting here.

I have a car I'm currently getting fixed, and I should have my own place soon.

Yes, I will send pictures before/if we decide to chill, so feel free to ask after telling me about about yourself.

Seriously. Non sexual, non come on, just pictures of you for your own record or to surprise/bless someone special with now or when that time comes.

Selfies don't do it. For one thing your arm isn't long enough. It is very limiting. The other is....well obvious, you see yourself as a woman, not as a man would see you. So your perspective, both ability to take nice pictures of yourself and your 'point of view' restrict the possibilities. 

We use your camera, so you have complete control over your intimate pictures. But you produce a record that you will cherish and, let's face it, won't always be there. I am very artistic and take wonderful pictures. I have a long history in the visual arts. Have a great eye for composition and the female figure. I have seen countless approaches taken from fine art to the stuff on the magazine rack. Your personality is key.

What is in it for me is simple. I am highly visual and taking beautiful pictures is a joy. Period. 

I am a tall, nice looking male, white, middle aged, well educated and very well domesticated. In other words, it will be just about taking your pictures.

So nothing to worry about. You might even have some fun seeing yourself in a different light and have some ideas of your own. 

The more light reflexes the better. What I am saying is being a full figured woman is an asset when it comes to creating spectacular pictures. There is much more visual play between light and dark, depth of field and 3 point perspective. In other words the possibilities are endless and only limited by one's imagination. So if you have a lot to work with don't be shy. Blushing adds another element to your pictures.

Tell me what's on your mind and some ideas visually you have wanted to explore!

You and only you know how you wish to be portrayed. But

Hey ladies!

I'm posting this here because I'm not looking to hookup. I'm just looking to chat with someone who is confident in themselves and sex positive.

I'm bored as hell at work. I want to see your beautiful bodies. Send me some of your pics! And let's chat. You don't even have to include your face. Discretion is honored and appreciated.

I want to talk to a real person for a change.

Please put ""pics at work"" in your subject line to weed out bots!

Well, then I am looking for you. I would describe myself as a sapiosexual - yes, I find you with your sharp mind more attractive than the beauty with big booty or boobs in a dumb woman. 

Now - you may wonder - can I match wits with you? Well, you will only find if you will give it a try. 
I am married, mid-30s, educated and professional, fit/average looking - with a little extra time to surf CL and fantasize about a woman of my imagination...I wonder do you really exist.

I'm not going to beat around the bush. I am an average looking, overweight guy. I am bald. OK, those are the negative things. The positive, I am extremely funny, charming, and witty. I am outgoing, I can be the life of the party. I really love women. I relate well to them, and have many women as friends. What I seek is a friend...with benefits. Now I'm not talking full blown sex benefits, but more the cuddling, touching, kissing, softer core benefits. I am leaving Minnesota in 3 short months. Moving away to be closer to my kids, or at least more accessible to them. My decision has led people to steer clear of me, and it has been a very lonely existence at times. Tell you what, if you are interested, send me a message. I will explain more then. I know for a lot of people, it's hard to get past the overweight, and average part. Give a guy a chance, I know you will be pleasantly surprised. I'm 54 years old, and seeking really any age. Thanks for reading my ad. Stop by and say hi. I don't bite, but would love to nibble!!

Right, straight to the point. 
I like to draw and otherwise get involved in creative pursuits, and I'd like to make more friends these interests. 
I'd like someone who'd be down for just hanging out and drawing together from time to time (and doing other things, of course, this is just the main thing I'm looking for).

I'm personally from rice county... I don't mind driving up to the cities for friends if you're from up there, but if you're from closer to these parts, that'd be awesome too. 

I'm hoping to find someone who is open-minded, non-judgmental, and someone who will put a decent amount of effort into the friendship, someone who at least values positivity even if they don't always hit the mark. Someone I can feel comfortable around and trust (I'm a bit skittish and shy, and I'd like to find someone who doesn't have a problem with that). 

I'd prefer to meet friends who are also single.

A bit about myself and my interests, just so you can know if we'd have things in common.
* I like metal! Especially symphonic metals bands along the lines of Nightwish, but lots of others as well.
* I recently bought a sewing machine (meaning I fully intend to have a costume for RennFest this year)
* I like to read, and I work at a library
* I like trying to learn a lot of do-it-yourself kind of skills. Since I don't always do so well with people, it's nice to strengthen anything I can just do for myself.
* I like stories of all kinds. Literature, film, comic book, anime, history, video game, roleplaying, theatre... any kind. If you like stories too we'll get along absolutely swimmingly.

Have a nice day!

I want a real friendship that can lead us toward a long-lasting relationship. I believe that love is a Friendship on Fire! I believe that any relationship starts with friendship, respect and trust.

I'm multi-ethnic you would probably think I look latina, weight is not average but not anywhere near obese. I have a preference towards white men. Always have, always will.

I'm told I'm a very thoughtful and caring person. College educated (if you care, just don't proofread my post..hard to type on phones) Never smoked, never done drugs, rarely drink, but I love to have fun and laugh. Don't mind if you drink ect. I'm pretty laid back.

My interests are pretty broad. I like camping, traveling, action, suspence, horror movies, going for walks, people watching, being by a lake, kayaking, biking, softball, volleyball. One of my new things is eating healthier but not ready to throw in a serious workout...baby steps.

So that's about it. Hopefully I haven't bored ya and you want to send me a message

It is my preference to meet some stay at home or working moms with toddlers to have and do activities with during the day times. Moms are just easier to be around, guys run like hell when they find out there will be a toddler and new born involved in the fun lol.

I've met a couple good friends off of the strictly platonic section of craigslist before, but haven't posted here in years. Randomly seemed like a good idea today. It would be great to meet someone who is cut from a similar cloth.

The mindful and openminded parts come from having Buddhist tendencies. I'm trying to live intentionally and spiritually is becoming more important to me as I get older. I'm also trying not to take myself too seriously. 

Other than that I'm a rather slender lad with long hair who has a myriad of interests. I look quite young for my age. I'm very sarcastic at times and love to laugh. I'm a student in the helping fields, which requires a great deal of tact and genuineness (and the accepting of suffering in life), but I have the skill of bringing humor to serious situations too. I'm compassionate, gentle, open-minded, very autonomous but supportive to people I let into my life. I like reading, fixing cars, sometimes brewing wine, meditating, and things done in nature. Right now my life is quiet busy with school, internship, and work, but in my spare time I like going out to see live music (primarily alternative rock, but open-minded), meeting people to talk over beers or tea, or otherwise finding entertaining ways to fart around. I don't like to put people in boxes, and don't like being put into a box by others.

Please live in Minneapolis or St. Paul MN. I am 66 years old, am retired and am looking for good relationship. I am also an atheist. I do have depression with anxiety. If you find this a problem, well, what can I say. I am a good guy and do my best. Really. Seriously. If you don't live in the metro it probably won't work. Someone to have a dialogue with, go for a walk, go to the movies, out to eat etc. I am a Philosophy student at the University of Minnesota. I guess you could say I am a liberal thinking person. Always interested in learning new things. I deeply believe in HUMAN RIGHTS and am passionate about treating women with dignity and respect. I live at Cedar Riverside near the U of M. Not wealthy but manage anyway. If you are interested more in the person than the picture I would like to hear from you. [However, I have to say with some irony, please include a picture so I know who I am emailing.] I do not smoke, drink or use drugs. I'll tell you a little bit about me.You already know what I look like and my age so that done. I enjoy music, walks and conversation. I like playing tricks and having with people I am around. Quiet moments and reflection on philosophical matters really interest me. I love watching and have scores of documentaries from PBS and elsewhere about the brain, mind, politics, the 60s generation with its history and music, classical and jazz music, pets, academia, children playing, watching it rain, light hearted and deep conversation. There's more but for now. I believe I am an empathic, caring person. I believe in fairness, honesty and justice. These are traits I suppose a lot of people would embrace so maybe I am no different from anyone else. I hope that will help you decide what you want. I'll anxiously await your reply.

This really caught me off guard as you would never know they struggled as they always seem so happy. He explained...they put on a good face!

I'm a 27 year old white male who lives in Burnsville right now. I work with disabled adults in a group home and I drive a small bus part-time. I recently was accepted into a school psychology program about an hour away from the Twin Cities, so will be starting that this September. I've been through 2 long-term unsuccessful relationships and have moved like 5 times in the last 5 years. I believe I'm a good guy at heart, but have just been through a bunch over the last several years with people. I kind of have a lot of bitter feelings towards people, especially women, and I'm working on getting rid of that. I work a ton so I don't really have too much of a chance to go out and meet people socially. I thought maybe there would be someone out there in a similar situation to me. Maybe you've just gotten out of a relationship with someone and feel hopeless, or maybe you're just lonely and need someone to talk to? If that's you maybe we could be friends. Even though I'm a bit of a nymphomaniac I'm seriously looking just for people to talk with. Although I'm sort of a boring guy, I have a lot of depth to me and I think I have a lot to contribute to the world and feel like I'm pretty mature in my thinking, as well. Well anyways, before this turns into a wall of text, shoot me an email?

Hi. Thanks for checking out my post. I am looking for a very discreet NSA situation with an attractive woman. If there is chemistry, this could be an on-going thing. 

A little about me... Professional, attractive, well groomed, intelligent, sane, and DDF. I am just shy of 6 feet tall and around 175 lbs. with a lean/muscular build. I am married and am not looking to change my situation - hopefully you can relate and don't judge.

I find women who are confident, comfortable with their bodies, playful, and know (and most importantly, can/do communicate) what they want/like to be incredibly sexy. I am fairly open when it comes to sex but also understand and respect boundaries.

My ideal evening involves meeting for some cocktails, a little flirting, and then going back to your place, slowly undressing each other and then doing whatever it takes to make you have the most earth shattering orgasm you've ever had. Preferably you have a high sex drive and are able to go multiple rounds.

Please change the title in the SUBJECT line of your response, include either photos or a description of yourselves in your response and use complete sentences and proper grammar. If you use any type of ""validation"" website/service, please don't bother responding. Sorry, no M, MW, or WMM - just not my thing.

I'm thinking of making a small group of people who meet each week, or alternating weeks, at different parks in the West Metro (not necessarily dog parks) to get our dogs socialized.

I have a two year old Staffordshire Terrier mix who came from an abusive home, and we live in a neighborhood with very few dogs meaning she doesn't get much for doggy hangouts. This has, in turn, made her not too receptive of other dogs. I think some regular leashed dog meets would help with this!

Ill start by saying I'm not just looking to ""get high""; I have numerous chronic conditions that have been professionally diagnosed over the years, even though I'm fairly young (30). 

Without health insurance or a steady job, seeing specialists is impossible and seeing clinic doctors can be prohibitively expensive.

Oftentimes, like right now for example, I am given meds that do not work for me, or that I don't like the side effects of. I usually keep them in case they can help someone else.

Even if you just want to discuss living with pain, I can use friends who truly understand what this means.

I'm Specifically in need of tramadol/ultram but like I said, anyone who wants to talk is welcome to email me.

It's hard out here.

You know who I am talking about, that cute guy from down the street. The one who you see outside with his kids and always seem to notice when he passes by. The reason you take a little longer to get ready when you might see him at a neighborhood party. The guy who you always seem to lock eyes with slightly longer than you should.

Acting on those feelings could really make things complicated though. You are friends with his other half even though you know she doesn't make him happy. The rest of your neighbors are amazing and you really don't want to risk the gossip. The whole situation has the potential of turning in to one big mess.

Funny thing is, I bet there are situations like this in every neighborhood. I know there are a few in mine. Maybe the solution is to find someone in a neighborhood a little further away instead. Could be interesting to see what might happen...

Hey everyone!

I recently moved to Minneapolis and I have been starting to live a healthier lifestyle. I have been eating healthier and working out on a regular basis. It's been hard because I don't know anyone who lives close to me so I'd love to find someone who is passionate about health and fitness who is within meeting distance! 

Please note that I'm married so I'm strictly only looking for a friend. Male or female doesn't matter. I have a gym membership at Planet Fitness and I'm allowed to bring a friend with me each visit. It's getting warmer so I'm also looking for someone who loves the outdoors. I'd love to have someone who would be able to meet on a regular basis to play tennis, run, or go biking! I'm totally up for trying new classes or trainings as well. I'm up for anything active!

I hope to hear from you but if not, thank you for at least taking the time to read this! :)

""Every adversity, every failure, every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit"" -Napoleon Hill

Another weekend is soon upon us. You have others around you planning their days into the minutes and yet you know you'll be by yourself. Ever wonder how you can feel so alone in a house so full? Wonder how you went from friend and spouse to acquaintances and roommate? Lost in thought, feeling empty and missing the warmth of a simple touch? Not willing to change your situation but willing to sow a seed and grow something beautiful?

I'm a 40 year old attached devoted dad (to wonderful kids that I adore) and business professional. Healthy living and a focus on physical fitness have been how I have compensated for the lack of a connection or intimacy. I'm looking for that connection, the lost spark that makes your mood lighter and brings a smile to your face.

If this strikes a chord with you I can appreciate how you are feeling. Determine that today is the day that you will plant a seed and make something grow. Please put ""seeds"" in the subject line and include any details that you'd like to share.

Why Platonic? I'm looking for a connection that quenches a thirst mentally first, and with chemistry the physical component will follow naturally!

Have a great day!

age: 33

Yes, I actually mean platonic, even though I'm single trying to date is not a priority for me right now. I'm a pretty normal person, I just moved back to the area and am looking for a/some new people to hang out with whether to watch/play sports, any competitive activity like darts, pool, or bowling, or of course just good conversation and have some wine or beer. Whether it's stories, politics, new ideas/technologies, random facts, debating a random topic, religion, jokes or just getting to know each other, I'm pretty easy to get along with. I've had an interesting life, and enjoy the intriguing ideas and unique thoughts and approaches. I am a divorced person who has struggled with depression in the past, I mention that just in case we can relate through some of the same issues. A little more about me is that I don't smoke, I am a Christian, I've never done drugs, and I do not have any kids. I'm also a proud INTJ if that means anything to you. 
If you think we might get along I hope you reach out and send me an e-mail, I know it is craigslist so I don't have much hope for this.

Hi! So, I'm not sure what the deal is. I've lived in Woodbury for a little over 3 years and have failed to make a single friend. I will say that it is entirely possible that being a stay at home mom has affected my chances of meeting new people but I'm not a complete hermit. I get out but, at 30 years old it's a tad strange to ask random people to be your friend lol. I'm extroverted and chatty and admittedly too energized at times. My personality type is ENTP for those of you who know what that means. I am a social drinker and enjoy getting out of the house for whatever really. I like people but dislike dysfunction. We all have a little drama from time to time but if you can't stay out of jail or off drugs, we probably won't hit it off. I'd like to think I've got a pretty good sense of humor and am intelligent. I strongly dislike dull. Introverts probably wouldn't get along with me unless you're more of an extroverted introvert. Anyway, I wouldn't mind someome to go out to do girly things with or even just hang out. Like I said, I'm a mom so my outtings would either include my kids or I'd need to plan things out in advance so if that's not an issue and you think we may hit it off then drop me a line and lets see if we click! Note- I am not looking for side action as I'm happily married and I'm not looking for ANY male friends.... Hope to hear for you!

I am a 35 year old white male. Professional, educated, athletic, tall, and fun.

I am looking for a woman preferably married who is looking for a little spark in her life. A reason to get dressed up cute on your day off.

I would like a female companion for an occasional date and some casual flirting.
I typically have a free weekday once every two weeks. This would be a fun way to get to know someone new and see of we have any connection.

HI... Thanks for looking! However, please read in its entirety before flagging please :) I am a 39 yo looking for a friend to hang out with and do some shopping, movie, lunch etc periodically. This is strictly platonic. I live in the Maplewood area and only get out about 1 time per month during the day. I cannot get out in the evenings too much (sometimes later afternoon) or weekends for the most part. I am fun, humorous and respectful. I love living life and meeting new people. I live life to extremes as you will see. I am in good shape and very educated. However, I also love to cross-dress and have been doing it since I was very very young. Thats right...I am a guy. However, I have been leaning more to transitioning and am looking for a respectful woman to have some fun days out and have a friend to talk to. I have posted on T4W but all I get is guys wanting a transgender and women who just want to have a sexual experience. I am not like that so I thought I would post here and hope for the best. It is tough...believe me! Anyway, you can see from the pics that I take this very seriously and can pass (I think). I would like a real-person to get some feminine tips from including possibly some make-up ideas, clothing etc and just have some fun. YOU: must be nice, respectful, outgoing and able to communicate well. The next time I will be going out shopping Feb. 29 (Mon) I would like to email/text a bit first and get to know you. I would like somebody between the ages of 25-50 but depending on character I may budge LOL. Please contact me by putting ""nice friend"" in the subject line or I most likely will not even open it. NO GUYS!!!!! NO GUYS!!!!! NO GUYS!!! I will ask for pics at times to verify you are who you are...or try to anyways. I have tried this prior and got mostly junk responses.

I am looking for someone to train with. I am currently training for an Ironman, and needless to say my friends want nothing to do with that. lol
I have a history with marathons, and biking long distances. Swimming has always been a challenge for me. I'm getting better, but still my weakest link. I run and bike a lot outdoors. Getting out there as soon as the weather warms up. Now I currently train at Lifetime Fitness. I'm there usually 6 days a week. Not saying the person I train with needs to be that dedicated but having someone there two or three times a week would be perfect. 
What I'm looking for:
Someone that is really into running/biking/swimming. Not necessarily all three. A great benefit would be someone that is a solid swimmer to teach me a few things. I'm very confident in my ability but I'm smart enough to shut up and listen too. 
If this sounds interesting to any one please let me know. I would accept any pointers as well.

So it seems that no one knows what ""platonic"" means. At this stage of my life it's hard to make new friends. In high school and my early college years it was easy. Nowadays, people look at you like you have some ulterior motive or something. Maybe it's the society we live in these days *shrugs*. 

I am interested in meeting other guys close to my age (20s up to about 35 (must be old enough to drink. . . legally)). I am not discriminatory towards race or sexual preference, just understand that I'm looking to hangout, not make out.

About me:
I like to workout, watch sports (particularly football), play recreational sports and activities, bar games, going out for drinks on occasion, bonfires, video games (on occasion), go to concerts, see new movies (just saw Deadpool. . . it's a fourth wall break inside a fourth wall break! That's like. . . 16 walls!), rock climbing, and seeing the town amongst other things. 

Message me back if you're interested!

You stay fit and keep yourself well put together. You have the perfect smile, send out thank you letters, have your calendar mapped out for months... But you never let loose. You never get a chance to unwind. 
I would love to take you out for a night where you simply have fun, have a few drinks, maybe sing some karaoke or something random and silly, and then let you return to the daily grind.

So, none of my friends are interested in seeing Deadpool but I'm definitely going to check it out. I don't mind going alone but I figured I'd see if anyone else was in a similar situation (or just wanted to see the movie with me because my ad was so charming and engaging) and wanted to come along. I'm planning on going tomorrow or Tuesday evening. If you're interested, respond with a photo and I'll do the same. I'm sure this post will generate TONS of responses but I'll get back to you as quickly as I can.

About whom I am. I am 53 years old, brown eyes, salt/pepper hair. I am 5'9"" tall in good shape, I am muscular, but could use a little more weight, just my opinion. I have been told that I am a good looking man, maybe, I don't know. I had been married to the same women for 27 years until she passed away in 2006. My wife and I had 2 Sons, Ron and Mike. The kids were born 3 years apart, Ron being the oldest. Ron passed away in 1989 at the age of 6 years, his brother Mike followed him and passed away in 1981 at the age of six years old. My wife and I adopted a little boy at birth, David; he is 17 years old and now lives with his biological mother. I have been a widow since 2006 but since then live with a women that I love, but that love is no longer returned to me as she is seeing other (Men), that is plural. Knowing this I can not stay in a relationship with a woman that has destroyed trust and will not return love, I really believe that she is incapable of this. I have never cheated on my wife, and never cheated with who I am with now. But I do find myself lonely and needing to reach out and find life again.
I have always been a hard working man. I consider myself Honest, compassionate, caring, sympathetic, giving, and as my wife once had said to me that I was selfless. I do have a sense of humor, like to smile and laugh. I am driven, meaning that when I am put to task I tend to complete it no matter how difficult it can become.
I am looking for a Woman with the same traits that I have. Honesty, trust, and communication are very important to me and I look for these qualities in any future relationship I may have. I am looking for a woman who is a little strong willed, can hold her own with a little sarcasm on the side. This woman should feel comfortable in her own skin as well and feel good about herself. The Women I am looking for should be comfortable in jeans, and then feel just as good dressing up to go out, whether that be out to a club, dinner or formal outing. I am non judgmental and she should be as well, and this also holds true when she looks in the mirror at herself This Women that I have described here would complete me as I would hope that I would complete her has well. I believe that when the individual genders come together in a relationship such as I described, they become a whole new separate being, a being with two half's that complete the other.
I know that might have been a little long winded, please don't look at this any other way but trying to give you a complete picture of who this Man is, and please don't take this as a sign of weakness or desperation.
I hope that this has help you a little to understand this guy at the other end of the keyboard. I wish you well in everything you do and seek out. 

Hello! I am currently going through a divorce and have a little girl that I have 50% of the time. I have never ever happier. I've been online dating for nearly a year with a lot of disappointed. I've decided to take a break from it and just focus on myself. I am working on being a better me. I try to go to the gym several days a week, try to find fun new things to do, travel when I get the chance, and just taking full advantage of my new freedom. I'd love to find someone to do these things with. If something more comes from it, great, but I'm definitely not pushing for it. I really want a laid back fun friendship with someone who is as easy going as me. 

I'm 28, live in Maple Grove where I own a condo, orginally from a small town outside of the cities, I work in the financial world, sarcastic, easy going, and just trying to enjoy life.

Hey everyone! I assume that if you are reading this, you are a toker like myself that is interested in meeting other tokers. I am NOT looking for sex, just friendship and toking fun! That could include kicking back watching movies while we toke, going on drives or walks, etc. I love to toke indoors and outdoors, depending on the conditions!! Lol! I'm not much of a drinker, as I see it as a more harmful substance than others. Even if you don't toke, but are supportive of others that do, then I'd be happy to meet you! I don't smoke to get high, though it is great to be high. I smoke because I have chronic pain that otherwise keeps me from doing, or enjoying things that I like to do. It is the best medicine I have found out there, and I've been toking since high school, so about 12 years now, so I know how much it really helps me. Anyone else feel the same way or are doing the same thing?

So it seems that no one knows what ""platonic"" means. Hint: It doesn't mean sex. At this stage of my life it's hard to make new friends. In high school and my early college years it was easy. Nowadays, people look at you like you have some ulterior motive or something. Maybe it's the society we live in these days *shrugs*. 

I am interested in meeting other guys close to my age (20s up to about 35 (must be old enough to drink. . . legally)). I am not discriminatory towards race or sexual preference, just understand that I'm looking to hangout, not make out.

About me:
I like to workout, watch sports (particularly football), play recreational sports and activities, bar games, going out for drinks on occasion, bonfires, video games (on occasion), go to concerts, see new movies (just saw Deadpool. . . it's a fourth wall break inside a fourth wall break! That's like. . . 16 walls!), rock climbing, and seeing the town amongst other things. 

Message me back if you're interested!

I'm an active, outgoing, career-oriented guy looking to meet someone of a similar lifestyle and mindset for friendship with the potential for more if we click. To give you an idea of who I am, I'm big into fitness and sports, keeping up on current events, traveling, skiing, music, movies / Netflix, coffee, beer, bourbon, cooking, and restaurants/bars/taprooms.

I am not looking for the mirror image of myself, but rather someone who is complementary to me. I'm 5'10"" with an athletic / in shape build, brown hair, and blue eyes.

My name is Sarah, I'm divorced, female by birth and I'm not gay. I'm not wanted by the police, FBI, CIA or local magistrate. I'm not a sex offender or out on parole nor have I had sex with little boys. Don't smoke or drink and I'm not the type of girl just looking to get laid for a ""meaningful"" overnight relationship. I know that guys know porn is cheaper than dating so we have a set back. Also, I'm not crazy, I just do what the little voices in my head tell me to do. I know they are not real but they do have some good ideas. I'm not stupid, just hard of thinking. I believe my ex husband and former boyfriends would make excellent speed bumps for my driveway and it should hurt to be dumb and stupid people should be sterilized.....Just to tell you a little about myself. If you think you may want to chat, let me know.
I have had sooo much bad luck just looking for a friend to chat with. Hope to hear from you.
Please send me three pics and I'll return the same. Need to know who I am talking to. Most replies I get are from guys who can't provide more than one or two computer pics. If I were looking for guys, I certainly would not look on c/l, Lol. just want girl talk, that's all.
Also, I was once diagnosed with schizophrenia but the doctor says we are both just fine so don't sweat it, okay?

Hi,

I would like to meet someone to grow a close friendship with. A bond that reaches beyond monthly dinner/coffee connections. I'm looking for a woman who is looking for a woman to talk to, about nothing, cook dinner with, watch Netflix with, shop with, go on vacation with, and comment on attractive men and women with. Yes, I am bi-sexual, but I am not looking for a relationship (meaning I am not trying to find someone to have sex with). I am, however, searching for female companionship, which to me, is more important.

Honesty is of the utmost importance to me, so if you struggle with lying, we won't pass go. I am also a physically fit person, so you should enjoy long walks, occasional workouts, and the idea of running.

If you have a genuine heart, and are looking for companionship in your life, please reply. We should talk. If you are a red-head, please definitely reply.

I am very curious about the dynamic of this type of relationship. 20 year old pretty girl with a 50 year old wm who is well educated and nice looking...and of course married to make it even more forbidden. 

So what's the deal? Are you in such a relationship now...or when you were in your 20's did you engage in this type of relationship and now with more experience can describe what was going on and may even wish to discuss it with someone who is interested in the why and wherefores of such a relationship...love? friendship....? other? Please enlighten me. 

Is it driven by a daddy thing? Or, perhaps financial and resource motivates. Is it that the 20 year old males act like 15 year olds and so a man in his 50s is attractive? Or you may have other reasons. 

I have inquired about this with women that have been in such a relationship but they are pretty secretive about it....even embarrassed. So what is the deal? Maybe here with the privacy of CL you can tell me what is going on and how it worked...or is working for you? 

I have never been in such a relationship but am very curious. At this point I am not asking to be in one really, just want to know more about it. 

Maybe too you would like to get some things off your chest? Maybe you would like to ask a man in his 50's what is going on....things you could not ask him (if in your case this happened in the past) and you have some burning questions of your own. 

Where you seduced? Did you seek it out? What was your own family dynamic like and how did that, now with the benefit of hindsight affect the choices and your outlook at the time...or if happening now, in the present?

Sincere Questions. Appreciate getting your take on it...from your experience, insights and wisdom.

Thanks!

Have you been or are you now in a relationship with an older man? That is are you perhaps in your 20s'...or were years ago...and were sleeping with a man in his 50's? 

I have personal reasons why I am trying to understand this and would appreciate insight as to how this happens and what would be going thru the mind and for that matter the body of a woman....pretty and smart yet would have an unconventional relationship, sometimes referred to as a 'forbidden relationship' of this type.

Is there a daddy thing going on? Is it the prospect of more resources? Is it being tired of 20 year old males with 15 year old mental capacity? I mean....what is the motivation? 

There must be some commonalities as well as extenuating circumstances that result in a pretty 20 year old woman getting involved with a man in his 50's. 

I am such a man myself. Educated, nice, good looking, white, etc. I do not have such a young woman in my life, not sure really if I would want that but am very curious about it. I know of people who have experiences this type of relationship but they clam up when I ask them about it. 

Perhaps here in the privacy of CL you can enlighten me, maybe get some things off your chest. I don't know. Whatever. 

I hope I hear from you. It would help me settle some questions that have bothered me for many years. 

Thank you. Really....I would really appreciate your insight...wisdom and knowledge.

Hello there!
I'm just a guy with his life pretty well together, but find myself with plenty of lonely/boring time (don't we all?).
So I would like to chat/get to know/make friends with a younger woman, since I find I get along much better with that type. And by these terms, no, I don't mean the typical-CL-guy bullshit; I'm not looking for a hookup. Sorry, ladies ;)

Just as a guide, I'd say probably 20s or 30s,cute (of course) but mostly, I'm looking for someone open-minded, smart, interesting/exciting/intriguing, with a sense of humor.

Hope to hear from someone who fits the description.

Oh, and if you have a problem or are offended with the title, then you definitely do NOT fit the description, and you should leave my post, CL, and probably the Internet altogether. Or google ""sense of humor"".

You talk about date night but you are the only one who researches ideas. The dog receives more affection than you?

Hello!

First off I am 29, very happily married, and would never change or hurt that, but I really enjoy getting to know new people, that are okay keeping it platonic, or risking any harm to anyone's relationship. I am also from Texas, and enjoy getting to know people from other areas as it removes the pressure to meet if there is a connection, and keep relationships safe.

I work from home most days, which also means I don't do much on those days, and it would be great to have someone new to get to know and share things with. I'm very open minded, goofy, extremely laid back, I don't judge, I'm allergic to drama, I can be really sarcastic but I know when to turn it off, easy to talk to, and I've had an interesting and unique life so far, so I think I have quite a few interesting things/stories to share. I also have a bit of a dirty mind, and might throw a ""that's what she said"" into a conversation at some point. I am also a major night owl, so if you are too, even better!

I am looking for someone who is: intelligent, funny, witty, understands sarcasm, open minded, non-judgemental, dirty minded, drama free (although venting is allowed), easy to talk with, and just fun.

Again not looking to meet or change anyone's relationship, just looking for fun conversations to get through the day or night.

Hope you are having a great day and I'm looking forward to chatting with you!

Hi,

I'm interested in meeting someone who is interested in wearing diapers. I'm not really sure why I'm so curious about it, but I thought I would post to see what kind of people respond? I'm not interested in it in a sexual way, but the caring compassion is intriguing. I don't think I care if you a man or a woman, but I think it would be fun to explore this with someone who is petite. I think you have to be pretty small, so I can put you back in pampers or huggies.

Please don't be rude, I know there is a significant range of people in the world. I'm looking for good people who can be honest and innocent.

Dear ladies of Craigslist,

I am just curious if women on CL (ok -- especially the few attached/married women here) have the same issues find the right men as I seem to when it comes to finding a woman. I guess you are in demand and have lots of options here -- from total crazy to a little crazy.

All I want is just one woman on the side (besides my wife) -- I have a big heart but may not have capacity to love more than that :-). I am 37, fit/hwp but short (5'7""), so you decide if you are interested. I have dark hair and brown eyes. I try and get to the gym a few times a week. I have a graduate degree, a decent job, a wife and two kids, a house in a cul-de-sac in the suburbs . . .all I need is a secret paramour. 

You are smart and attractive, between the ages of 35 and 45, health conscious, adventurous (well, if you are here -- you are already adventurous). . . I do want this to be more than a virtual relationship -- so, hopefully you are open to meeting at some point. Based on prior experience - I think I may have already lost all of you by now - so, if you are still reading this, maybe that is some sort of signal :-)

Hi , Im Nancy , Im 47 yrs old living in Plymouth in need of new friends to hang out with and have some good times . I never get out and feeling pretty alone and trapped . 
Im single , shy at first , not a big talker , I drink sometimes and I do smoke ciggs , but would show respect if you do not . 

Looking for friends who like to go shopping , out to eat , coffee , concerts , bands at local bars etc .
the reason I don't get out is that I don't drive which limits what I do . so if this isnt a big problem with you and your looking for a side kick Id really like to hear from you , maybe we have something in common .

Greetings!

I am looking for someone to share time with. EMail is good to get know each other, and Words With Friends is the sort of thing to pass the time at many times of the day.

Both offer flirting opportunities. With Winter almost over, the outside world is opening up again for walks and art fairs.

If these things interest you, then feel free to reply. Pictures on request. 

Warmest regards

Allen

To you CL regulars, you know I have posted this ad several times. But it has resulted in some great conversation. Thanks for all who have replied. 

As I sit and surf through all the m4m ads on Craigslist, I am just wondering how many other guys out there that are like me. I am married and am a professional and rarely respond to any of the ads that are out there. Yet, there is something about the possibility of connecting with someone in the same boat that keeps me coming back.

Would love to chat with you if you feel inclined to respond to this post.

Thanks

Good evening, 

I have had some thoughts on my mind lately and I guess I would like to ask some questions and then see where all this goes. 

I work in a very professional work atmosphere. Would you be willing to critique suit choices, give input, new ideas from a woman's point of view? Do you enjoy seeing a man dressed professionally?

Maybe down the road you would want to join on a shopping trip to give input up front? 

Look forward to some honest, real replies...

I'm real, the wild fired Yeo yesterday, but I'm not sure that's the entire issue with the team. Time will tell!

I have been in the process of transitioning MTF since October. I have been told that I am very positive and confident and I thought,why not put that to use in helping other trans women (or men) who may need support and guidance. I would love to help someone with makeup, hair, shopping... But of course I can also be here for emotional support as your trans sister. So you let me know how I can help. We can start small or get right to meeting for coffee. Say hello!

Are you in need of something you can't talk about with your friends. Do you long for that time alone with a confident, attractive man, who gives you what you need, what you desire most...a warm red bottom. Many women secretly desire being spanked, panties pulled down, laid bare in front of a man. To be able to let go and release yourself. 

Does this describe you; 

""Personally I enjoy getting spanked because it helps me let go. Life is stressful and I don't want to deal with it sometimes. It's wonderful to know Im safe with you and you care about my need...to go over your knee and have my bottom walloped over and over. I become numb, I cry, and then the endorphins in my brain take over and I reach a euphoric high which you call my 'subspace'. And finally, when you've taken me as far as I can go, you hold me until I'm back, back in your arms and then you feathers me with kisses and talk about....whatever. 

This is what I offer to a chosen lady. Please be respectful, and honest with all your replies. 

I look forward to our time together. ;-)

Those reason sometimes involve finances, partner issues, or the lack of the previously mentioned. Additionally, I've witnessed incredible couples break up because the male could not produce children. This is such a tragedy! Recently I had a very dear friend approach me asking to help he and his spouse become pregnant. After much thought I accepted. It has turned out to be a rewarding experience, giving the gift of life to an amazing couple. I want to offer my services to any loving couple or qualified singles, free of charge, and without obligations. Please feel free to contact me for more information. Also please tell me your reasons/wants and post some questions for me to answer so I understand more about your needs.

Hello,

I am a 32 year old straight male who is currently and very happily married. During my early and mid 20s, I explored my sexuality with both sexes. My exploration process allowed me to know so much about myself and I am thankful for that. And I am also glad that my sexual history is not a secret to my wife and the people who are closest to me. 

So I am wondering if (an)other man/men would want to message/converse about whether they have gone through similar experiences. And to me it does not matter whether you are bi, or not out, or still figuring it out. I am just wanting to converse about the process of finding ourselves and figuring out where we land in the sexuality spectrum, and what have been the least and most challenging experiences throughout the process.

I think this post speaks for itself, but I am not looking to exchange pictures or anything of that sort. I just would want to converse in a way that feels comfortable.

There are many keywords to describe what I am looking for but here is a list: DD (domestic discipline), HoH (Head of House), TiH (Taken in Hand), D/s, Daddy Dom, LTR, 1950s household.

I am looking for an intelligent young lady who will be a mix of wife, submissive, little girl.

I have been heavily attracted to the domestic discipline type of lifestyle, with aspects of D/s as well. Where the man is in charge of the household and my girl will have a set of rules and guild lines to live her life by in every day life. In the context of a loving relationship where peace and harmony is the norm, and me as a harsh disciplinarian when needed. She will know her place in the relationship and while I will acknowledge her opinions, thoughts, and concerns.. I will have the final say. If she breaks these rules or forgets her place, her behavior will be corrected with discipline appropriate for a young girl (spanking, mouth soaping, lectures, writing lines, grounding, corner time, etc..). Her position in the household will also be confirmed with other bdsm play to remind her of her place and because I enjoy it.

I want my girl to be intelligent, caring, loyal, funny, healthy, and of course obedient. Someone I can share ALL aspects of life with. When we go out together we would appear as a very close professional couple, but she would secretly know her place. If she starts getting out of hand or stops being respectful, a simple pat on the back or a glance would remind her and foreshadow what might be in store for her later that night if she continues. When we are behind closed doors, she will play the role of a submissive girlfriend/wife.

About me: I am a 37 year old Dom, with many years of experience in various types of play and a healthy appetite for new experiences. I am intelligent, strict, caring, grounded, good job, fiscally stable. I have my life in order but still searching for the right one. If the above type of lifestyle interests you msg me as I would like to talk further with you.

While I would prefer someone local for obvious reasons, I am willing to start a long distance relationship with the right person.. although I would not want it to drag on without fairly frequent meetings.

I am also available as a mentor / disciplinarian. As I enjoy helping people reach their goals via encouragement and corporal punishment.

I am 5'-8"" tall, 175 lbs, blue eyes, strawberry blonde hair, but I usually keep my head shaved bald. I have lots of tattoos also. I'm open to meet just about anyone that will give me a shot.

I'm looking for someone that will be there for me completely. Physically, emotionally and financially. If you like what you see and hear, then contact me, send me a picture, lets see where this goes.

So i'm stuck at home tonight. 

I had plans to go out but I'm sick and it'll be no fun coughing all over everyone and making a general mess of things. 

I may be out of the action but i'm not down. I'm bored and looking to find ways to burn up the evening. I could do the usual things, order in, play video games. watch TV or even be productive and get some work done. 

I don't want to do any of that though and would rather find someone to chat with. Can just be tonight or maybe on going. 

Email is fine, IM is better. 

I'm mid 30s, educated, professional and all around interesting guy! You be these things too except the guy part. I have enough guy friends and I don't want to talk guy stuff. I want an actual conversation and I find thats really only possible with another woman. 

So, lets do this thing. Help me out!

Wanted: A woman who wants to develop artistic renderings of herself with the help of the male eye and perspective. Pen and pencil drawings and photographs/digital. 

Perhaps you want to have a personal record for various reasons. You might be shy yet you want to have tributes to your features as a woman. Or maybe you are very outgoing and somewhat exhibitionistic and enjoy not only the process of presenting and capturing your unique ways but having a testimonial of you that you can prize for yourself or special others.

It is all really about angle and lighting. The joke was if you put a fish eyed lens on any picture you will get the desired result. Not so. But we can do that route also and you can see what you like. 

Rubens and company were right though. So was Renoir. What I am getting at is I can do a lot with pen and paper or a camera but I can't pull rabbits out of hats. In other words you should have much to capture artistically. To put it even more plainly you should be at home with the following descriptions.

You are......fluffy, big, heavy set, plump, large bottomed, busty, fair skinned and pretty. Full figured to BBW to SSBBW. XXX ....20 W to 30W sized.

Well, why are you here one might ask? Well, there is one thing missing that I just am tired of doing without. That is having that ""someone"" whom you can share your day with, genuinely cares about what you are up to, and misses the flirting and excitement of talking to that other person....did they send a text or email....a nice distraction during the day. I feel I am ready to try and find this, so giving CL a try. I am not looking for any games or one night stands. Initially just looking to find someone to connect with and see what happens. Am I up for meeting possibly, sure, but we would both need to comfortable and respectful of each other's situations. 

Well, that is it. Short and simple. If you want to give me a hollar, please do. I will respond to all.

Thanks!

Are you a woman who loves taking photos? 

It would be fun to get together with a woman who is in shape and attractive. I mention this because not only would it be nice to co-op on a photo venture, but I'd like a woman who might also do some modeling work in front of the camera. Who knows? You may want to bring out that inner model. If you have a person in your life, we can get some nice photos of you for that person.

I'm a reasonably nice looking guy, 65, white, in shape, respectful and fun. I'm not a smoker, drunk, druggie, or weird type of person. This is my first attempt to find someone like you, so if at all interested, drop me a reply and we can go from there.

Hello,

Where to start:
I fell for the wrong woman, she is smart, sexy, mature, educated and accomplished. She is also married...

Anyway, not sure what I am looking for: she tells me that women should be all over me, not my experience though. I am 40, single, never married, no kids, east coast southern, educated, pretty smart, and i guess reasonably attractive...

I think I would like a friend, or maybe a soulmate, or maybe a friend with benefits, or maybe someone to just use me for sexual gratification. I really don't know at this point. I'm pretty busy but I have learned that I have time and make time for what I feel is important

Sorry to be so indecisive, maybe help me?

Hope you have an awesome day

I look forward to any responses and i don't just throw my pictures out into the net without having an idea of who I am sending them to. I will respect that of you as well

My post is one of many today and most likely will be lost in the massive amount of guys looking to hook up. I am not one of those guys!!!!!!

I am 47 years old 5'11"" 220 pounds and have been working out daily and playing racquetball 3-4 days per week as well. I love playing racquetball which is way more fun than spending an hour on the elliptical. I am married with 3 adult children and very bored these days. I have been married 25 years and I swear my spouse has turned into the man and me the women because she has no desire for intimacy. I want to hold hands, kiss and cuddle she just wants sex and to go our own separate ways following the act.
If you are looking for a guy to do these things with please send reply to this post. I am not looking to exchange pictures because I am married but I would like someone similar to me and to be attractive, outgoing and in a similar situation as I am in. It would be great if we could hang out, text, talk and become friends and hit it off! 
Again, I am not looking for sex because I have not been with another women for 20 plus years and it scares the crap out of me.

Thanks and I hope to here from you

Other interests are natural remedies, playing Words with Friends, tai chi (would like to take classes), photography, travel.... Shows: Orphan Black, Game of Thrones, The Leftovers, Downton Abbey, Gotham
So far I've attended one Meetup friend's group and met another mother and their child for a playdate. Would love to meet some other people! Majority of responses have unfortunately been guys or people who email but never meet. 
I'm very laid-back, unpretentious, say what's on my mind, appreciate people with a sense of humor, currently living in Edina but don't mind driving (within Hennepin), to hang out.

Highly dedicated to making moves in 2016 with strict nutrition and lifting schedule. Looking for accountability, and a little motivation if the chemistry is right.

Over the years, I've had a couple of very pleasant extended interactions with women I've met via Craigslist. As you might imagine, this hasn't come easily. I've posted quite a few times, and most of the responses have been somehow off the mark. Sometimes respondents have been looking for a different kind of interaction; many times there has been a simple lack of chemistry; and, because it's CL, frequently the problem has been sheer lunacy on the part of the respondent.

With that history in mind, I think I can do a better job of articulating what I'm looking for and which type of woman might be the best fit for me in this endeavor. Please note: I'm not offering any kind of authoritative global commentary on what's ""right"" or ""good"" here; I'm merely stating what works for me -- an admittedly imperfect person. I respect the fact that it might not appeal to everyone, but I'm probably not interested in having an extended argument about how misguided or unfair I am. 

First, a little about me: I am an academic in my late 40s. I'm married and have a couple of kids. I am generally content with this situation. Truth be told, I'm not desperately unhappy. However, I find myself somewhat restless, and looking for sustained connections online. My goal in doing this isn't to engage in a torrid physical affair (more on that later) but rather to find steady electronic interaction (mainly via email) with someone who stimulates me intellectually, emotionally, and physically. Only one or two email per day probably won't be sufficient to hold my interest. And -- despite the length of this posting -- I'm usually not someone who writes a short essay with each response. I'm looking for short but fairly steady contact (knowing, of course, that sometimes life gets in the way and one can't always respond immediately).

My partners in this kind of interaction invariably have been younger -- usually women in the 32-40 age range. I am not sure why this is --honestly I'm not obsessed with the idea of connecting with a ""younger woman"" -- but I have found it to be comfortable. Also, they have been reasonably well educated and engaged in professional careers. (No, I won't be expecting to see a resume, but there will be more common ground with someone in a white collar occupation.) I'm a fit, active person, and I'd prefer someone who is similarly inclined (runner, yogi practitioner, etc.), or at least fits into the ""HWP"" category. There are some other characteristics that I value, but they seem rather generic and subjective: sense of humor, literacy, taste in music, books, wine, etc. 

Finally, regarding the possibility of meeting in person: It's not my primary goal. Furthermore, I'm posting this ad outside the area where I actually reside, so it would be extremely difficult to pull off. However, with the right person and under the perfect set of circumstances, I would entertain the possibility.

But first, let's email.

Hello there. 33 year old white male in the south metro here. Clean cut, professional, normal kinda guy.

I live near the Brooklyn Center LA Fitness and I am just starting my workout plan. Due to recent injuries I am moving into the workout routine slowly.

I won't make any bold claims and say that we could be soulmates. After all ... to find out such a thing takes time and conversation to see what really makes the other person tick. 

You are probably a very successful person, you have much going for you and much to offer. People around you would never expect you to be searching the CL posts looking for a deeper connection as your life is already filled with good friends. 

Yet, still ... your heart and soul ache for something deeper. You're not looking for romance or sex (as wonderful as those things are) but more for someone that you feel can understand you on a level that most seem unable. 

I'm married and connect best with women in their 30's, but I am open to exploring a friendship with any adventurous woman who is looking for more than a diversion from daily life.

I am making a list; a list of fun activities and events to do and attend with my 12 years old daughter.

I am a divorced guy in the mid 40's. I have lived here for a while but not a native Minnesotan. As you know, between earning a living and life getting in the way of living, one get easily stuck in a rut.

I have my daughter alternating weekends but get stomped to figure out things to do. Her life at her mother's is essentially going from school back home. I am looking to add a more well rounded exposure. I am big on volunteering and that's something we have been doing a lot of lately. I, however, want to open her experience to various other activities especially ones that would be fun to do after volunteering.

I usually ask her what she would like to do for entertainment but the response is usually the same: I don't know. We have done some day trips and would love to add more. As it is said, the bare essentials of life are experience, growth, and contribution. I like to make a list to fill those buckets. I thought about playing a ""12 years old"" tourist with her. What would you put on the list if you were being a tour guide in the cities and Minnesota in general? I want to keep it as simple and minimum cost as possible.

I need your help. I will be happy to compile a list and share it with anyone else in similar situation.

Thanks for your response.

Cold, clear, calm autumn mornings lately. The weather pattern has been consistent. High pressure. The temp seems to hover right around 35 degrees F at dawn. Balmy. The sky twinkles with retreating stars and glows with pinks, purples, the warmer yellows of a sluggish sun on a jagged horizon. I'm out the door for work around 8am. That glowing ball has finally climbed its way above the foothills and I'm headed to town, West, with the low sun at my back, East. It's cold so full gear. Heavier gloves, heavy jeans, riding jacket with some protection for the back, shoulders, arms. This gives me a sense of false confidence. This is exactly what I do not need. I wear running shoes because it's easy to feel the shift lever and they are comfortable. The shoes are mesh and it feels cool when the wind blows through them. I gain speed, check mirrors, am blinded by the bright reflection of a beautiful sunrise behind me. Visor is up through sixth gear, the wind whistles around and through my helmet. Instantly awake. My eyes water. The visor goes down and I twist the wrist. 70 mph into town. 

It takes about a minute to get to the outskirts. 40 mph, 25 through old town, East Main, down through the gears and into second. I glance at the display. Tach-ing 4,000RPM's, engine temp is where it should be at 175 degrees. I note that the engine sounds great but there is a subtle rattle coming from a section of fairing. It's sleepy in town, not much traffic. I need to go to the bank on Main to deposit a check. Usually I go inside but it's too early for the lobby to be open so the drive thru it is. No one is there. I pull up, kick the stand, hop off, rummage through the backpack, start talking to the teller. She's really nice, and she's really cute. I notice after about 10 minutes of random conversation about our respective lives that she is really easy to talk to, that I don't have the $60 in cash I asked for, she still has my debit card, receipt, etc. Finding this comical, we both laugh at the situation as it unfolds. She's a bored teller from Boston. She's curious why I'm not in the slightest hurry to get to work like everyone else. She's beaming. That's what tellers do, right? We share a weird connection but I'm outside in full motorcycle gear leaning against a pole, shivering, wondering where all my shit is, and she's a beautiful woman dressed up in a glass booth. 

A van pulls up and she is forced to do her job. We say our goodbyes. She asks me if I want a lolly-pop for the road. They call them suckers here. Maybe there too? I told her no, I would probably crash and I just brushed my teeth anyway. She tells me that she's there all day if I change my mind. I laugh, thank her, start the bike. It revs high because the engine is cool. I make a quick left out of the bank and a right onto Main. Second gear, third gear. 40 mph. Buzzing to work with Thursday morning coffee smells in the air I'm thinking that my fingers are cold and it's getting harder to pull the clutch. Involuntarily I tilt over to grab my butt for a wallet check. I notice the heat of the sun on my back. It feels good. The maples around town are in full color. It's a beautiful morning. 

A light turns red and I stop. Samantha comes to mind and I think that I never even thought to ask her out. Not once. 

I'm just a simple guy here in Montana. Eyeing your area and will be exploring it eventually. Looking for someone to start some sort of dialogue with. Maybe words, maybe pictures, maybe some combination? 

I love people. But as a super-sweet ""pen pal"" and friend preferably you would be of a similar age, you would be sane, educated, empathetic, and able to write effectively. Ideally you're engaged in your community, you're active, you're in shape, you're petite, you're healthy, and you don't spend hours every day staring at your cell phone. 

Copious bonus points if you ride bicycles or if you're a 420 girl or if you're a hockey girl or if you write more than two sentences or if you don't send me something from your iPhone while you're stuck in traffic.

Do you exist? Write to me. Tell me a story.

Let me start by saying that I don't live in your city. I live hours away and I've had difficulty identifying like-minded black professional friends. 

I have a great career but my social life is lacking. I'm incredibly down-to-earth, relaxed, honest, etc.

I am in my late 20s and somehow I've made my career my life. I'm single and I don't have any children.

I enjoy traveling, shopping, relaxing at home, some reality TV, etc (I enjoy the simple things). Family and friends are incredibly important to me and above all else I am a Christian. 

I don't club, party or engage in the use of any type of drugs. I am a social drinker. 

If you are a educated black professional (relatively close in age) I would love to hear from you. I assure you that I'm as normal and sane as they come and CL is a unusual approach for me.

I was recently informed that there are a couple of nudist clubs just a short drive from St Paul. I've always been interested in going clothes free for a day, or a full weekend if all goes well. I'm a little bit shy about getting naked. My breasts are huge, and I have the ass to match. I'm worried that people will be judging me. I've read that most nudist club members are pretty judge free, but it'll always be at the back of my mind. To help counter this I'd like to spend the day, or weekend at the nudist club, with a couple whose female has the same/similar physical attributes as myself. I guess I'd even be open to just go with another female with similar features. As of today, Super Bowl Sumday, I'm single, but hope to be attached by the time when it'll be warm enough to have to pack nothing more than a towel for a weekend getaway. 

So, if you're a nudist couple, or even just interested in checking out a nudist club this summer, whose female 1/2 is a BBW, or you're a single BBW nudist, change the subject line in your email to whoever you think today's winner will be, and tell me a little bit about yourselves. Happy Super Bowl Sunday! (Please no single guys. True, I am single, but I've got my eye on someone)

I'm 23 and my depression is quit bad right now.
I've always have been a loner, but my social circle is down to nothing
now. As much as I want to be with people, it's a frightening and at times
impossible thing to do.
I'm looking for someone who get's that. Who know's some days are worse
than most. I still live at home. I'm not able to work much.
Lot's of times the medicine does more harm than anything else.
Now I have a mom and Dad, and everything's as dis-functionally fine as it 
can be.
But I want some who isn't family. I'd like someone older than me.
Who has wisdom. I'm not looking for sex or romance. 
I want to be close to you, to confide and laugh. To be friends but
more of that mother-son, or big sister-little brother, and the conventional peer friendship.
I'd like to email at first. Maybe talk on the phone. And hopefully we could spend time
together when I'm doing a little better. I was thinking meeting for lunch sometimes,
things like that.
This is by no means a requirement, but I was thinking you to be in the age
range of 40 to 60.
You can be married, single partnered, lesbian, or an alien. None of that matters
since this isn't about sex.

So many posts give a long list of what they want and hope to find in a woman. 

I'll turn that around ... what are you hoping to find here? What is missing in your life that you seek such a friendship? Or maybe nothing is missing but you just like meeting new people. 

Whatever the reason, tell me what you desire and maybe we can start a friendship.

Something I've begun to notice now that I'm old and decrepit at 28 is that I need to get out more.
I'm not necessarily talking about drinking! I've been there done that, but I'm more or less just looking for a new friend, man or women to hang out with, go to the gym, go out with.

Hello,
I am a Non-binary Genderfluid person and need a friend who can be there when I need them. Someone who I can talk to, someone I can hang out with, someone who will help me out if they can, and cares about my day. Someone who could understand what I'm going through is a plus. Or at least someone who can be sympathetic. 

I am currently homeless and staying with a friend temporarily. I have Aspergers and I don't drive, but do take the bus when I can. I have no job yet, and just so much else that is making things harder. But I need to be around people sometimes and I need someone who will notice when my smile doesn't quite reach my eyes. 

If you feel like you are someone who could do that, then please message me back.

Long shot but you never succeed if you don't try right?

Anyways, I'm looking for a person who would want to sneak out with me every so often (tonight??) for some fun. 

Can be anything, grab a bite to eat, hit a bar, see a movie. whatever. 

I've been married for a long time and my spouse does not like to get out much anymore and it drags on me. I'm just looking for a friend who can commiserate and maybe join me. If you're in the same situation as me then we can scratch this itch!

I'm posting in platonic because I honestly really just want a friend, I'm seeking women because I feel like I can have a better friendship with a woman, especially one who is experiencing what I am. 

Also, I'm cool with just emailing, texting, IMing.

What better way to fill winter days than with some email exchanges with strangers. Sound like fun? Me too. First things first I dont live in your city or even your state, its easier that way, no worries from you that I'm your next door neighbor or a stalker. Everyone is happy.

So what am I looking to talk about? Anything and Everything. Life. Experiences. Interests. We can compare notes and see how life has been.

Traits that you may have that will make you a good match for me:
- Between the ages of 30 and 60
- Married
- Curious
- Non religious
- Intelligent
- Open Minded
- Likes asking and answering questions
- Mostly Positive about life (although plenty of sarcasm and knowing winks are welcome)

Dont decline to respond to this ad because you think I will have to many or be overwhelmed, in fact being as I am male this ad will mostly likely go not only unanswered but unread, but to you the potential reader of this who believes that there is still fun to be had by emailing strangers, please respond with at least 2 sentences and we can talk. It will be great. I promise.

I sometimes read about all the psychos, crazies, lunatics, liars, etc. ... that inhabit this board.

I just want to say that my experience has been far from this. I have found a number of women to be very intelligent and thoughtful in what they write. Some have had amazing life experiences that have given me new perspectives on things.

Many are able to deal with the complexities of life. Life is not simple, nor are there easy answers ... we are all here for different reasons and cannot be lumped into simple categories. Some see past age, politics, and religion and can try to understand other's as individuals. 

Many are kind and compassionate. They have offered me words of encouragement at hard times. 

I have been fortunate to meet in person with many and they are often great conversationalists and quick to listen. 

So thank you to all the women that act with respect here and challenge the notion that people on the CL boards must be a little crazy.

2. A BBW. This means many things to many people so it is almost useless. Plus some women are actually offended by the term. What do I mean? I mean you are built like a woman. You have curves, fat, yes fat, chubby tummy, any size breasts (NO BOOB ISSUES), large bottom, hips, basically you have a big butt...(think Queen's Fat Bottomed Girls, or ZZ Top 'She's got legs') don't know how else to say it. Sorry. Medium height. Brunette, brown eyes ONLY. White, fair skinned. Blushing and freckles get extra credit (what a jerk right, sorry). Anyway they are nice in my book. SMART. I love high intelligence. And when you think about it you need to be pretty smart to make what I am describing ....be attainable, i.e. platonic sensuality.
3. I think that covers it. We can discuss the rest. Reasonable? I think so. 

Me? Middle aged white male. Minnesotan. Educated. Better than average looking, actually most would rate me as attractive (but of course everyone has their preferences). Tall, nicely built, healthy, not insane. Professional degree and nice to be around. Personable, non threatening, non hostile, no diseases (but since it is platonic....not an issue anyway). Let's see, just about the nicest fella you will ever meet and for surely the sanest and safest you will ever meet meet on CL. 

For a LTR with regular platonic sensuality meetings. Think of it as taking a class as a continuing ed. student. The world is our oyster and we can discover much about ourselves thru the safety and encouragement of a nice fellow traveler.

Hello!

I used to be a fun guy -- I was out on Thursday/Friday nights, doing outdoors over the weekend, had a small but tight group of friends, watched movies, went to the concerts, road trips, camping, etc. etc. Then I married my girl (believing that the third long relationship must work), had a couple of kids, friends moved on, got promoted at work -- and now, I am an overworked, sleep deprived married man, trying to find balance between home and work life while trying to make everyone happy. My marriage has drifted into rough waters (and future doesn't look too bright -- but we are not giving up and keep fighting to save it), at work I am in that middle management role -not high enough to make the decisions and not powerful enough to get it done through my team either. 

Basically, life sucks right now and I don't want to just bitch about it. I would like to find a special 'friend' to talk to -- first via emails and eventually in person. My first thought was trying to talk to women at the gym or in grocery stores and I realized that's not a very bright idea - may have worked when I was single/younger but I don't have a good game anymore. My second thought was a friend's wife who is very touchy feely towards me when drunk but as much as I enjoy the fantasy, I know it is a really really bad idea and will certainly lead to big trouble. So, here I am on Craigslist. I responded to a few ads and didn't get a response (I am not going to attach a pic in my first email). 

Writing is not my forte and certainly not this type of writing. I read some other posts in men for women section and while I am no different from others in my search (married men looking for women to email or have affairs with), I don't think I quite belong here and this is likely as bad an idea as hoping to talk to women at the grocery store. Otherwise too, I know I am likely coming across a complainer and negative person (which I am actually not). 

Oh, the customary info on who am I -- I am 36, married, engineer, . . . as for how I look etc. it will be easier to just exchange pics (if someone responds and we get that far). You are 30-40, married, professional/educated, . . . open minded for this sort of thing :-)

Even after quitting smoking two years ago and going vegan almost 4 years ago, my skin still has a shit ton of clogged pores. No matter how many times I clean them out, they fill up again. I've tried to get my partner to help me out in places where I can't see or reach, but it's just not happening, hence this ad. Hoping to find someone who would like to do an extraction trade, with someone who's also condemed with shit skin like mine, like once a month, because spas piss me off and give me anxiety, nor do I want to ask friends because they all have clear skin, and so, here I am, on CL, looking for a self taught pore clearing master, who's confident af they'll rid my back, neck, sides of my face, shoulders and upper chest, like a SHORT NAILED BOSS and open-minded, because I'm not the type to shave my pits and legs during the winter and I would love to grow a real genuine friendship.

What I Have To Offer: Clean apartment by MCAD (sadly no pets). During the day, I can provide a well lit private porch, heated massage table, crockpots for washcloths so we each have our own (heated and ready to go), essential oils, gloves. 

You bring what you'll need: extraction tool, wash clothes, towel if you want to take a shower, sheet for table, clay mask, etc.).

OK -- This ad is not for everyone and I admit, I am bad and I probably shouldn't be around here looking for women. I am married to a funny and beautiful woman, have two little kids, a decent job. . .life is good except I have a habit of wanting more. With the kids and busy life, there is not much time for intimacy at home and we always seem tired. Yes, I am trying to get the spark back at home but it is an uphill battle. I have been on and off CL for over a year and exchanged emails with a number of women -- I have been a confidant, a virtual lover/fuck body, a friend. . .but avoided meeting so far -- felt too much risk to my marriage. Well, there were barriers too -- either they lived an hour or more from me or some just wanted to keep it virtual. 

Now, I am back here hoping to find someone like-minded who would be willing to venture into more than an email fling. I am 39, hwp, 5'9"" -- 175 lbs. If you ever thought of cheating but were concerned about other things (risk to marriage, discretion, disease,...), I am the type of guy you want! I am posting this on platonic and not casual encounter section, because I want women like me who are like me (bad and may have cheated here and there before) and maybe looking for something long-term. 

Are you educated, smart, attractive, health conscious, 30-50 year old who may be interested in a secret lover? Tell me a bit about yourself, what part of the town do you live and let's explore.

MWM 49yo, attractive, hwp, prof. employed, educated, fun, outgoing but introspective with dry sense of humor seeks an attractive, hwp, discreet MWF with a naughty streak for ongoing email exhanges. Each day that passes is one you will not relive. Lets take at least add a excitement to the routine.

Only a dusting of snow last night but I'm really ready for warm temperatures, spring fever, sap running during the lusty month of May, etc. I'm only looking to pass some time chatting while I pace restlessly waiting for spring's arrival. I'm semi-attached (don't ask!) and not looking for love, a LTR, sex, one-night stands, or a spring fling (well, that doesn't sound so bad now that I write it!). I'm smart, passionate about life, and physically active. Shall we exchange spring musings?

I could go for an awesome friend whom I can help meet an awesome guy.

If you like athletic fratty ""bro"" types, I have an easy in. I know a lot about whiskey, went to a Big Ten school and know a lot about sports. I can be your cool black friend who doesn't cock block you and has no problem striking up a sports chat with strangers.

I'm also a writer who is the son of civil rights activists. If you're more into the intellectual guys, we can go to lectures and museum events and I can utilize my History degree to help you meet those guys with no pressure.

I'm also a pop-culture fanatic, so we can dominate pub trivia and you can meet other guys who have the knowledge you find so appealing. What can I say? It pays to be a renaissance man.

I've never had a good wing woman, so perhaps we can work together and be a super team.

I never thought I would be in this position since I married the woman of my dreams. She still is the woman of my dreams, but I'm starting to feel like I may not be the man of hers. I still try just as hard as when we first met. It doesn't really get me far anymore, and leaves me feeling like I have a roommate instead of a wife. I'm torn on what to do because I love her so much, but on the other hand I desperately miss being wanted, desired, or even thought of. There has to be someone out there in a similar situation through no fault of their own. I can't say if we'll ever meet, but it would be awesome to know someone out there is waiting for my next text, or if we do meet is excited for every opportunity to get together. I hope you're out there. If you are please message me.

I am a very attractive/handsome, athletic (lifelong hockey player), fit, professional that will be in St. Paul/Arden Hills on Wednesday night and looking to see if there is anyone who would be interested in grabbing a drink and or dinner with me.

I actually come to Minneapolis every 2 to 3 weeks for days at a time. Would be nice to meet a sustainable friendship.

Ideally i am looking for someone who knows more than i do about this stuff to help push me and help me shed some pounds. I am open to anyone who is willing to help. 

A bit about me, I am a 33 year old male, I am a big guy. (hence the gym) I am also a geek, keeping my eye on the pulse of a lot of pop culture. I love video games, super hero movies, horror movies, lots of different books and comics. I am educated and intelligent. Plus if you need your computer fixed I am your man. 

So lets do this and help each other get healthier.

I have spent very little time working on portrait photos or outdoor candid shots. I want to practice this and get better. This is not about shooting nudes. It's about finding the right person to model. The person that is willing to help me get better. What else it isn't, is me sharing the photos with anyone on the Internet. If you have past experience doing this I would welcome your input. I would like to find someone between the ages of 20 an 65. . I'm not going to say that I am locked into that age category, but it certainly covers a lot of people. Tattoos would be great. I can understand a woman's concern with doing this. If you are interest we can chat a bit and meet somewhere that you feel comfortable. The small details can be discussed when we meet. I am serious about this and am willing to share some of my past work to prove I am real. If a photo of me helps I am willing to provide you with one. If you are interested but still have questions for me, feel free to ask. Again, this is not about finding someone to photograph nude.

Here's what I am hoping to find. You will either think I am an ass or understand.
I am hoping to find a fun flirty woman that would like to have conversation and drinks/lunch with me tomorrow (Tuesday 2/2). It will be on me of course.

I am a 45 year old married guy and have the day available tomorrow and I have been wanting to kind of feel that someone was interested in me and possibly attracted or flirting with me? I am not looking for an affair or anything other than what I have listed above. Not really concerned about age or body type of looks....just the fact that you would be wanting to spend time with me would make you attractive to me.

I understand that there could be concern about safety...maybe you have a friend...more comfortable for you, double for me :)

I am real, safe sane and serious and hoping to find a fun flirty woman to spend an afternoon with.

Like I said, you will either get where I am coming from or think I am an ass and everyone gets to have their opinion.

I will respond to all who write to me.

Ill start by saying I'm not just looking to ""get high""; I have numerous chronic conditions that have been professionally diagnosed over the years, even though I'm fairly young (30). 

Without health insurance or a steady job, seeing specialists is impossible and seeing clinic doctors can be prohibitively expensive

Oftentimes, like right now for example, I am given meds that do not work for me, or that I don't like the side effects of. I usually keep them in case they can help someone else
Even if you just want to discuss living with pain, I can use friends who truly understand what this means.

I'm Specifically in need of tramadol/ultram but like I said, anyone who wants to talk is welcome to email me.

It's hard out here.

Some men would define what I seek as something beyond platonic. Yet 95% of what is posted in Men Seeking Men is far beyond what I want. Perhaps what I imagine is not possible.

If you are an intelligent, attractive, married woman -- over fifty -- who appreciates down-to-earth, over pretense; let's talk. If intelligence is important to your passionate sharing -- but not simply to ""prove or demonstrate your intellect"" -- let's talk. 

If loneliness in marriage and a home life without passion, is weighing on you; let's talk. If you're seeking an attractive man, over fifty, who is in a similar situation; let's discover each other.

Intelligent intimacies. Rediscovered passions. Newly found soulfriends. Thoughtful explorations. I don't really need to explain more. If we're mirror-images, we'll know it quickly.

I am looking for someone to share the simple lleasures of life and build from there. Is there another on CL looking for the same? Please put the color of your eyes in the email header.

I'm guessing that you are familiar with the classic Bill Murray film, ""Ground Hog Day."" 

I often feel that my life parallels the premise of the movie. I feel as if everyday is the same. As if a monotonous cycle simply happens over and over. Wash ... rinse ... repeat ...

Don't get me wrong, my life is wonderful in many aspects. It just lacks ... well ... I guess it lacks a sense of adventure. 

I am married and not looking to change that. I am financially stable, handsome, responsible, respectful, a great conversationalist, compassionate and an attentive listener.

I'm looking for someone in a similar position. You're cute, responsible, intelligent and have a lot going for you. Yet, you need more adventure. You're not looking for an ""affair"", but you do want to feel something inside your soul that has been missing. 

You are not looking for ""Mr. Right"" and certainly don't want to hurt those close to you, but you do want more than simply an email pal.

If you also feel that you are stuck in the Ground Hog Day cycle ... let's see if we can break out together.

I am a 62 year old man who is an avid hiker/backpacker/wilderness camper. I would like to link-up with a woman who would like to go on some wilderness adventures with me. Each year I go on two ""big"" wilderness adventures and several smaller ones. Last year my two ""big"" trips were to Zion National Park in Utah, and then to California where I climbed Mount Langley, a 14,000 foot mountain in the Sierra Nevada range. I also went on smaller trips to Tucson, the North Shore, and Red Rock outside of Las Vegas. I am not interested in a romantic or intimate relationship. I am seeking a physically fit adventurous female just because I have always gotten along well and developed excellent friendships with woman. This year I know I want to hike in the North Cascade National Park but before that, we could go on a couple day hikes to the North Shore just to see if we like one another before we plan on doing anything ""big"". Contact me and we can chat and then meet to see if this works for us.

O.K., here's the deal: I've determined that what women and men who are on this site - and particularly this category - are looking for two distinctly different things. Both are looking for the same thing, however: something that they are missing at home. Women are looking for lost conversation. We all know that as married life goes on, we tend to grow apart. Fact. Conversation gets more and more rare. Down to the bare-bones minimum to get by. It seems that women miss the day-to-day conversation that they once had from their partners - whether it be a husband or even a boyfriend. Your daily ""how was your day?"" and ""what are your dreams for the future?"" Am I right??? Women are just looking for someone they can chat about anything with; a true friend. Now, the flip side. Men. Men are also looking for what is gone in their relationship. Now once again, I am talking about the ""strictly platonic"" section and NOT the ""casual encounter"" section. Men who are truly looking for a ""hook-up"", sex, nsa, etc. are (should be!) posting/replying from the casual encounter section. I'm talking about men who are missing the sexy - NOT sex - side of things. Men here are looking for a woman to tease them, talk sexy, talk dirty, flirty, and fun. HOPING for some sexy pictures. Maybe even some real naughty ones. But NOT looking for a hook-up. And yes, I am one of those men. I want to ask you what panties you are wearing. I want to ask you questions about sex. What you like, what you don't like. What turns you on, what turns you off. So, with all THAT being said, here's what I propose to you: I'll give you what you want if you give me what I want. As you may have noticed, I can compose a sentence. I am intelligent, articulate, witty, sarcastic (in a fun way), playful, professional, and willing to engage. I can hold my end of a conversation; meaning I can both answer questions and ask them. You MUST be able to ask your own questions as well. Please re-read that last sentence. You will not get any ""one line"" responses from me. I am more than able to give you insights from a man's perspective on any subject. I - much like everyone else - have an opinion on everything! However, I also realize that my opinions are just that: my opinions. I am a firm believer in the saying ""Opinions are like assholes: everyone has one, and no one cares about anyone else's"". I am fairly non-judgemental. I would be more than happy to have sincere, everyday day-to-day conversation (what YOU need). In return, can you give me what I seek? Are you able to hold up your end of a conversation? Are you able to ASK YOUR OWN QUESTIONS?! Are YOU intelligent, articulate, witty, sarcastic (not mandatory!), playful, professional, and willing to engage? And, willing to include some photos? AND, willing to include some PHOTOS?! ;-)

I am a 49yo married white male. I am mostly looking for conversation via e-mail during the work-day to help my work days go by quicker. I sit in front of a computer all day. Maybe some evenings, too. If it should get to that...

I may be unhappy with my relationship, but I am NOT looking to change it in the near future.

If any of this sounds the slightest bit interesting to you, please send me a line...

I would love to hear from you.

Thank you for taking the time to read this entire ad!

I am also noticing that all my friends are married and hard to get together. I am single, so someone that is also looking for a wingman would be ideal to grab a beer and pick up some ladies. I am told that I look and act young. I don't smoke (anything) nor do drugs, but I like to go out, work out, and like most sports.

So I'm home for the day. The place is quiet and I'm trying to decide what to do with my rare empty afternoon. Read? Work? Watch porn? Space out on YouTube? 
I can hear the highway in the distance, through the partially open sliding door. Other than the noise of it the day is extremely quiet and still. I might walk down to the river and watch the swans. 

So why am I here? What am I looking for? Shall I list a series of qualifications for you? Maybe some conversation starters? I suppose I could. Then we can talk about how you like this and I like that. Maybe it works but I've never experienced it. I could pour my heart out right here in an attempt to appeal to your sympathies but that's just silly. 

The reality is simple. This ad will soon be buried alive by the constant flow of ads posted by desperate guys on this site. It's all rather hopeless and depressing. 

I'll keep it simple to wrap this up. I'm not going to make any declarative statements here or put qualifications on anything. Maybe you're just bored. Maybe you resemble some giant lonely iceberg far out in the vast ocean, only a small part of you extending above the surface to be viewed by the world while the expansive unseen bulk of your true self remains hidden in darkness far beneath the surface.

I'm a single dad, have two kids. It's been along time since I've seen a movie that wasn't animated, or eaten in a restaurant that wasn't filled with animatronics of giant mice or wasn't a pizza buffet, or any other kind of buffet.

Just wondering if anyone out there wants to get to know each other a little. Maybe at some point we can see a real movie or eat in an actual restaurant with no kids around.

Not looking for a quick hookup or anything. Just want to chat with someone, see where it goes.

I'm active, very fit, work out, play softball and basketball, honesty look much younger than I am, coach youth volleyball and basketball, like being outdoors. I have decent average looks, so if you're looking for movie star good looks then I'm not for you.

Hello. I could put the typical ""I can't believe I'm posting on craiglist"" line but let's be honest - I'm doing it. 

I'm lonely. I'm married but my wife seems to value her work, her exercising, her sleep, her personal time more than me. Yes we go on vacations, but at home - we are two strangers in the same bed (sometimes I just sleep on the basement couch - she does not care). Do I love her? Yes. Would I cheat on her just to feel wanted again....Frankly I'm beginning to wonder. I know it is a slippery slope. Still...I am a man and we men (regardless of what anyone says) are physical creatures....she hasn't touched me in months.

Is she cheating? No....she's too busy for that. Perhaps it is just to that point. 

Anyone care to chat? Will we ever meet - I don't know....but maybe you are ""in the same boat""

I am looking for someone to grow a friendship with over time. Looking for someone who is very outgoing, energetic, and who likes to be adventerous. 

I am a 21 year old male who loves virtually all things outdoors, cooking, eating, and some light gaming. I am very happily engaged to the love of my life and I have absolutely no intent of changing that. I think that it is worth noting that I am not interested in online only friends and I see no reason to exchange pics in the first email. I am fairly athletic and would like to meet someone like me who is not fitness model level but rather someone who can hold their own on a hike. If you think that you have what it takes then shoot me an email telling me about yourself. As a side note I think that I should note that I am an excellent conversationalist all though I find online interactions to be a unique challenge.

Right. First off, I will just say that I am looking for e-mail buddies, maybe chatting on KIK or some other IM. I'm very skittish so I'm not looking for someone to meet up in person unless I get to know you for awhile and feel comfortable.
Second thing that you should know is that I'm transgender (this is a big part of why I'm skittish). So that's where I'd hope you'd be open-minded. 
I'm rather desperate for supportive and encouraging friends who will be positive and not pressuring about this. 

If that's all fine with you, read on and see if we have something in common!

Well, I have a lot of geeky interests. Comics and anime especially (I've gotten into cosplaying at conventions rather recently and would love to make more cosplay friends).
I like writing and drawing as well, and would reallllly love some more creative buddies to talk art or stories with. 
My musical tastes revolve mostly around heavy metal (though I like some EDM now and then too).
I also have a habit of doing roleplaying games (mostly online), D&D, stuff like that.

I like some more normal stuff too, like sports (hockey!), but those are pretty easy to find friends who are interested in them.


Please tell me a bit about yourself (age, interests, etc.) if you decide to reply.

Have a great day~!

I have been trying to figure out CL for the past few months and as I responded to ads and posted my own, I learned more about what I am looking for, what I can and can't do, and what is fun. Also, the best ads are the ones that can accurately describe what the person is looking for so I am feeling optimistic.

About me: I am a married man, 38, hwp/fit - life at home is good but not enough sex (many reasons - though not relevant here). Many find me attractive and I feel that I am skilled in the art of lovemaking but that said, I don't have a chiseled body or a huge cock. I have a very creative mind, and I am very sensual - and I love exploring fantasies. 

What I am looking: a woman who is open for discreet relationship. I am a bit of dominant type and I would like to be your only online lover. I am hoping we could build trust where we have exchanged pics and we know each other. We could potentially meet one day - I think that real possibility is a huge turn on. In fact, I would like to imagine that we could meet soon - even if we meet more as friends somewhere than lovers.

If you are submissive type, we could explore that fantasy where I will give you orders. I would like you to be educated and professional, able to articulate and express your desires through emails and photos - another huge turn on for me. You are between the ages of 30 and 45 - sane enough to pull this discreetly and crazy enough to go on this adventure with me. I am a romantic at heart and hope I could find a friend forever here from this ad. 

Ok - back to reality - this ad is probably not going to get a single response - so even if you are not the right woman for me, feel free to drop me a line what you like and what you don't.

I'm seeking a friend who will like to maybe go to the movies with me time to time, grab a coffee and chat, and a work out buddy. I work out at the Y in coon rapids so if you have a membership that would be so awesome. A cherry on top would be if you play any instruments. Music has always been a major part of my life but it's been put on the back burner for the past year or two. I'm a 25 year old stay-at-home mom to a baby boy. I'm also taking classes part time online. I unfortunately have put making friends on the back burner and haven't really had any opportunity to meet anyone. I just would love an opportunity to hang out with someone my own speed, (mind you it's a slow one). As far as your age I would prefer someone in the rage of 24-32. Other than that I really just would like to meet you. I'm about to tear my hair out if I don't have some quality girl time asap.

I want to be that person to you that helps apply the information to action. 

Im 110% legit. We would be meeting at a SNAP Fitness. 

Im available nights & weekends. I have pictures and references. 

Best part. I DONT JUDGE. Only encourage you. 

Please put ""get fit"" in the subject line so we can start getting you in shape!

Hi! I am a 23 year old younger man, looking for a little more substance in his life. I haven't had a lot of luck finding this in my own age group, but have many successful friendships and relationships with people in slightly older age groups. I'm not looking for someone to baby me, or mother me or anything weird like that. Just a friend to get coffee with or go for a walk/hike with from time to time. I'm new to the area, so if you can show me around, thats a plus! Not really looking for anything romantic necessarily, but am not opposed if we connect well. I am handsom-ish, with long hair and tattoos. I enjoy writing, being outdoors (especially in this nice chilly weather), playing guitar, and relaxing at home with my dog. If I sound like good company, let's meet up :)

Hey! Looking for easy going girl(s) - I have no drama and prefer the non drama out of touch types! Perhaps I sound like someone you'd want to get to know. 

Most of my friends are guys, needing some more girlfriends I guess lol.


I live out in Eden Prairie, so hopefully you're out west like Bloomington, Tonka, Chan, etc. Plymouth or St. Louis Park is okay. It just makes no sense if you live near Hudson or St. Paul so that'll it'll be easier to get together. 

I enjoy gaming when I'm also not working at the job I love...I play bass guitar, violin, mix, enjoy writing, love 89.3, The Killers and The War on Drugs, my favorite store is Microcenter but I'm into shopping too I just never get to go, I love exercising (HITT, running), and I have a dog that is my child. 

I go to Lifetime, any location. Mostly EP, crosstown, Chan. If you're not in shape or experienced with training, don't be intimated, I'd love to give you pointers or just do light workouts. It's so much more fun with a parnter! :)

Drinks out are fun too every once in a while, local or downtown. Going to the movies, snow boarding, skiing, ice skating, and concerts at smaller venues like the turf, first ave. 



Thanks!

OK ... let's get this out of the way now. While I don't think age, race, religion, height, weight and other such things matter since this is simply a friendship (not a romantic life commitment) ... many others do seem to be very concerned with such things.

Thanks for checking out my Ad. You are into my culture and I am into yours. You do not need to write me and overly-explain why you are into African American culture. If you are like me, you get tired of explaining to friends and loved ones about what and who you are into and Why! We are all into things & people we are into and thats it. We are who we are. I do not care what your job, relationship or living situation is. Thats your business and not mine...I do not judge people. I am not better than anyone else.

Another big plus if you are 'Attached' or in an Open relationship, and then we will have another thing in common to talk about it. Pretending they do not exist or count in a section of CL, does not make them go away. :-)

Obviously due to the nature of this Ad and the area of Craigslist it is, there is no need to send me a pic or description. I intrinsically am a guy who does not have a Type anways and I am not into body shaming.

Also feel free to read in between the lines of this AD if you are seeking something. We are all adults with needs in any section of CL, realistically.

Put your favorite coffeehouse, teahouse (not many in the Cities) or cafe in the subject line.

{NOTE: Please do not reply to my AD if you are ""too busy"", dealing with stigmas about talking to or meeting someone from online. Sorry I had to type this out but nowadays you have to be specific about what you want on CL ads}

Hello, thanks for reading. Yes, it's Craigslist, and let judgers judge, and haters hate, but at the end of the day, I have to believe that there are a few women out there in a similar position as me. Unhappy sexually and otherwise in their current marriage, and just looking for something discreet and exciting with someone ""on the side"". 

I am not what you'd expect to find on CL, and I would assume that if you are looking in this section, and are still reading, that you are not the typical CL hook-up either. At any rate, if you're interested and willing to take a chance, shoot me a note, and we can find out a little bit more about each other, and see if there is something there.

That's right, from the start I tell it how it is. Little refreshing isn't it? I would like to think so. My intent here isn't to hook up. It's to talk to others and get to know you. Become friends, share thoughts, ideas, just check in to see how the day is going.

I think we could start something good and keep it going. Again I'm not looking to change my status.

So I have a dilemma ... I have 2 tickets for the Twins game on April 19th at 12:10 against the Brewers and have no one to go with. Are there any ladies out there that love baseball or just likes to go to sporting events, maybe even a Brewers fan, that would like to join me? I am a Twins fan, but don't mind a little rivalry. I am looking for someone that is enjoyable to be with and likes to watch a game in the elements, because it could be a little chilly. I posted this in this section because I am married and looking for more of a friendly companion than a romantic one. A little flirting and sarcasm is perfectly acceptable and welcomed. So, let me know if you are interested. I guess you need to prove you are real, so put the meaning of HR in the subject line.

How's your day? I am married but in an emotionally disconnected situation and I find myself missing good conversation with someone of the opposite sex.

Sometimes the easiest things in life are the hardest to find.

What I am looking for is really quite simple. I am looking for someone that I can chat with throughout the day. Someone to get to know, someone to help the time pass by with and someone to talk to about whatever crosses our minds. This is strictly a platonic friendship that I am looking for.

I am happily married and don't have any kids. My wife works quite a bit including days, nights and weekends and therefore we don't get to talk that much when we are apart. I work a typical Monday through Friday day job. That is why I am looking for a new friend. This can be strictly an email/text thing or maybe we meet for coffee one day. The key is fun conversations.

I have many interests that include board games, bourbon, hiking, camping, Lego's, movies, going to the gym, reading about new topics, playing with my dogs, craft beer, projects around the house and lots of others. I am currently 33 years old. 

You can be in a relationship or single as long as it's strictly platonic between us. Race doesn't matter. Age would probably be best between 30-40 so that we will have some things in common though it isn't mandatory. Mostly I am looking for someone who can articulate their thoughts, have fun, be open and willing to step out on a limb and get to know someone. If you think that might be you then send me a message and tell me a little bit about yourself.

I hope you got to enjoy the gorgeous weekend we just had and that you have a fantastic day!

Would really prefer if you were between the ages of say 20 to 30 so we are around the same age but am still willing to talk. Just to be upfront I like girls so there is not going to be any sex! Just friendship and seeing where that leads.
Please send a picture of yourself and a short discripion of yourself so I can tell who is real and not a robot. If you are a group of guys who would like to talk that would be awesome. Would be really cool to eventually hang out as a group of diaper guys.
Would also be great to meet daddies who just love diaper boys. If you have ever taken care of a diaper boy feel free to say hello.
Again mainly looking to chat, become friends and see where it goes. Please be 20 to 26 and we can see where it goes.

After reading ad after ad on Craig's List about individuals seeking to find a relationship offering meaning, contentment, or an opportunity to be spanked by a dominant transgender nun, I have decided that all I really want right now is a pretend relationship.

The benefits of a pretend relationship lie in being able to communicate (via email only) with another individual about things that are not actually occurring in one's life. It's the incredible chance to be completely dishonest with another individual who wants nothing more than a beautiful pretend connection with another soul.

We needn't share photos, real names, or accurate personal data. I will never ask you to call me, meet me, or send me your bank account routing number to help a deposed Nigerian dictator who will pay you back in millions. I just want to have a deep, intense relationship that has no actual roots in reality.

To be my pretend girlfriend, you must be exceedingly intelligent, articulate, and edgy. Your sense of humor must be phenomenal -- I would never pretend date someone who was not incredibly funny. You should be quite beautiful with striking features, (though I will never really know if it's true). It's essential that your mastery of English includes proper spelling. I will pretend break-up with you in a heartbeat if you make lots of typos. That's a major turn off...

I am, of course with this being pretend, a really bright, very good looking, pretend physician, who is coming off of a very painful pretend-break up, so I might be pretend rebounding right now.

Potential pretend girlfriends please note: I will not respond to any replies that include photos of your penis. (I don't expect any such replies, but it seems like that's what everyone writes at the end of their ads...)

Hi,
craigslist . . . here goes? I am a 55 yr old man who is interested in developing a friendship with the hope of becoming much more. I would love to go out with an amazing woman!

I am a positive, encouraging and extremely loyal man. I am fun, responsible, and I love life! I am patient, a good listener and faithful! I like hiking, camping, photography, cooking, golfing, dining out, sports, watching movies, cards/games, etc. 

It is important you know . . . I not only want to connect with a woman emotional and physically but spiritually. I am a Christian man who loves the Lord with all my heart. 

I am physically fit and enjoy activity. Walks, bike rides, hiking, bonfire, etc. It would be fun to go out to dinner, or a cup of coffee or a beer some night. I am a romantic at heart and love cuddling and affection.

FYI: I am NOT looking for a sexual relationship at this time. I want to connect with a woman's heart!

So I didn't grow up in Minnesota and don't have family here who would have had a cabin on a lake up north somewhere. I feel like I'm missing out. I thought I might as well see if there's a single woman (or man) out there near my age who has a family cabin and would like company. 

I'm not looking for anything sexual. Just a quiet place to get away occasionally and someone to enjoy it with. 

I'm a 40 year old divorced male (two kids, but they're only with me half the time). I'm a quiet introvert who enjoys reading and drawing and photography. I'm also a lover of the outdoors--hiking, camping, just sitting and enjoying nature. I'm a Christian (not that it matters) and I don't smoke or do drugs.

Hello and Happy Whatever Day It Is.. :)

I promise to make this the best post you read all day or I will admit defeat and buy you a few drinks. 

Here stands a happily married Black male aged a lovely 33 years. 

Love the wife and have no intentions of leaving her.

However we have opposite schedules and she happens to travel a ton for work...

How is this a problem? 

It is patio/bar season and I have no one to sit outside and enjoy a Long Island with... 

Not looking for an affair or anything other than a smart, witty person who enjoys girly drinks with umbrellas... 

And as I said with the offer of best post of the day or drinks on me.. How can you lose? 

Lets chat...

Between us, we can weld grand thunderstorms of longing, hear the screech of bending iron, sparks igniting against the friction of thought paired with thought. We can spit words out at one another like marbles, hear them rolling through blood vessels, through heart valves, through cranial nerves. Through windpipes that sigh in the dead of night while the moon looks in the window.

We'll probably never meet, but we'll pack sentences together like careful origami and send them to one another through the magic of internet. Be male. Be female. Queer. Married. Be whatever you want to be, so long as you're mouth-wateringly literate. 

Let's make our hearts pound through an imperfect love of an imperfect language. Let's suspend disbelief, make words the currency of our own reality. 

Write and tell me about something that lights you up inside.

Hello :)

I'm on here looking for a potential best friend.
I've been in a hetero relationship for a year and a half but previously before him I was exclusively dating women. Since I've met my partner I've felt some of my close female friendships have desolved a little and I'm missing that female bond. 
I'm 420 friendly
A social drinker
Very artsy
Covered in tattoos
I enjoy music, nature, and animals.

I'd love to get to know someone and see if we can build a friendship :)

I'm a lesbian, but I do like the way it feels to cuddle with a snuggly guy. I would like platonic (i.e. clothed non-sexual cuddling) with a single man (don't want to get mixed up with an involved man), 25-50, and be able to host; this would be for ongoing. Perhaps you're missing touch in your life, we can help each other out! Big plus if you have a cat(s) to add to the mix--dogs are also good, I have a snuggly one at home! Non-cigarette smokers only (I'm very allergic to cigarettes); 420 friendly and light drinking okay.

Me: friendly and fun, artsy/creative, late 20s, lesbian, BBW, warm and very cuddly. :) I've been told I'm good at massage, we can exchange massage too (i.e. platonic/therapeutic non-sexual massage).

Not looking to spend the night, just spending a few hours together at a time (watch a movie, chat, etc.). Please do not respond if you think ""cuddling"" is code for ""sex""--truly, it will get you nowhere with me. As much as I enjoy the feel of a guy, getting pressured for sex from guys is uncomfortable, so please respond to a different ad if looking for sex--thanks!

Hello, thanks for stopping and reading!

I've thought about making a post for sometime now and couldn't ever decide on what to write, how to write it, or what type of person would reply. Mainly, because I'm married and only others who have been married would understand.

So, I've decided to list some things about myself and if any of this strikes a chord with you when you've read it and have the courage to respond then I'd like to hear from you. Where things go from there, who knows, that's more than my decision to make.

In no particular order...

1. Married. Said above but wanted to be clear.

2. Not even 40 but struggling with my own mortality and watching the kids get older makes it even more interesting.

3. I have no hatred for my spouse, but if asked if I'd do it all over again the answer would be no. (Kids excluded of course)

4. Find myself looking up at the stars on clear nights, wondering if I'll ever be with someone and feel whole just because they're there.

5. Knowing without a shadow of a doubt that if it weren't for children I'd have ended the marriage a long time ago, but am willing to put up with my own sadness if it means their joy.

6. I find myself looking around at other women in normal situations(ie grocery shopping) and wonder if they could be feeling the same way as me but they've figured out what I haven't, which is how to be happy even though they truly know they're not.

7. Been wondering what I'd do if I were to meet that someone that is in my situation. What would we do? Would we meet? What if there's an attraction? Is an affair, physical intimacy included, something I'm even capable of in the long term?

8. Generally happy with all other aspects of my life, except who I chose many years ago to share it with.

9. The one thing I don't want to do, for the kids sake, is break up the family. I can't say I haven't thought about it and I'm someone who believes anything is possible, but for the kids' sake, I hope not.

10. Contrary to what some may say, I view #9 as a show of strength, not weakness. If you think it's weak then you can't relate, but either way I have nothing to prove to anyone.

Please don't flag, I'm very real, and if anything I said doesn't sit well with you then you should simply hit the back button and not judge those who are different than you.

Princess, we need to talk about what we did the other night....First, we need to make sure this just stays between you and me, because no one else will really understand sweetie, especially mean Mommy!.....You left so quickly the other night we didn't get a chance to talk, but I could tell you really enjoyed what Daddy did to you...When we were on the couch watching a movie, you turned it over to a dirty movie on the satellite....I told you you should probabaly turn that off before Mommy comes in, but you smiled and left it on....such a naughty little girl you are....The girl in the movie was on her knees sucking the guy's cock, and I asked you if you had ever done to a boy what the woman was doing to him...you said no, but had always wondered what it was like....About that time, you could see that Daddy's cock was hard thru his pants, and you asked me if you could touch it....I said yes, and princess, it felt soooo good when you unzipped Daddy's pants and pulled his hard cock out...the touch of your hand was so soft yet eager....I asked you if you wanted to put your mouth on Daddy's cock....your eyes got soooo big...I could tell you were excited but hesitant.....I told you I would look out to make sure no one was coming...so you did, and OMG princess, your mouth felt amazing!!.....It was all I could do not to moan out loud....Daddy put his hand on your head and held it down on my cock....you did so great princess, you just kept on sucking further down...up and down...up and down...I could tell you were really enjoying it :).....I loved how you took Daddy's cock all the way down deep in your throat and held it there...until you gagged....you got Daddy quite messy with your saliva princess :)...that's ok, I loved it....Mommy had never ever sucked Daddy's cock like that....and then you surprised me! You grabbed Daddy's hand and pushed it down under your skirt and panties...omg princess, you were soooooo unbelievably wet!...it was so warm and hot...you immediately started moaning as you kept sucking Daddy's cock..I slid a finger deep inside your tight wet pussy....you looked up at me with those innocent but naughty eyes...I could tell you wanted more...I couldn't take it anymore...I told you ""princess, Daddy's about to cum"", but you didn't budge....you kept your head down and kept sucking, Daddy's finger, now two fingers, shoved inside your wet pussy....I started moaning and began to cum when I heard a noise...I pushed you off and a few seconds later that mean Mommy walked in...you got out of there so fast princess! You didn't even say good night to Me...Mommy didn't see anything princess, I promise...So I have to ask, did you go back to your room and play yourself as you thought about Me?? Did you get any of Daddy's cum in your mouth?......I really want to do this again princess, it's all Daddy can think about!! I can't even focus on my work at all!.....Please email me back princess....I think you deserve a nice firm spanking from Daddy for leaving so quick the other night :)....we can meet and play again somewhere private and Mommy will never know...Daddy has so much to teach you.....Just put ""Daddy's Girl"" in the header and send me a pic(s) so I know it's you ok?

P.S. Added a couple pics that made me think of you :)

Daddy

If reading this makes you wet, you're who I'm looking for.

I am 30 years old attractive Indian and looking for a Frfiend to spend some awesome time with conversations and fun. Anyone married, unmarried are welcome. 

I am very frank and straight forward when it comes to expressing anything. I believe I have good sense of humor but I use it only when I have good company. Always feel like I am never too old to be adventurous. I like one who has values and traditions but not the baggage that comes with it. You can find that there is some discipline and a method to everything I do. I like to try new things, be adventurous, go to places. Live the life when you can and not wait to live some other day is one of the things I believe in. I have respect for those who know what they want and live happily in pursuing them.I give complete support whether it be my partner or my friend.

I love to socialize and love to participate in charity/community works. I am not a 9 - 5 person. I bitch about alot of stuff and sometimes I sing in the bathroom. Started learning how to cook and i don't know how to make tea :P. I love taking a road trip, Long drives (Hell Yeah....crazy abt cars) and hiking to bless my soul. I would rather swim in the ocean, than stare at it.

With me its all about building and Spending time and based on understanding, respect, and trust. I know you could be her. I am attracted to thoughts, intellect,opinions, and ideas. . 

I am very intelligent, outspoken, fun ,energetic, and look at life as set of challenges that I must work hard at in accomplishing. Everything happens for a reason. Everybody that comes into your life happens for a reason. Whether they are Mr. Right or not remains to be seen. You'll never know unless you take that chance.

Hello:
I am a good looking 54 yo bi but primarily gay masculine dude. I'm 6' 210 pounds brown short hair, hazel eyes and am very well endowed. I like baseball, history, music, politics, cooking. I am 420 friendly and enjoy a few beers. I am looking for a younger, or young at heart masculine HWP dude to get to know, have good conversation, and if the connection is there to have an ongoing FWB situation. I am very respectful and kind. I have been married twice and have two grown sons. I've been divorced for about 10 years now and have been primarily with dudes. 
My ideal criteria would be as follows. I am attracted to younger ( 25-40 give or take) in shape masculine dudes. If you are a baseball fan that would be a huge connection. Looking forward to the season starting. I would like to find a partner and explore the cities by bike. I have a road bike and a mountain bike. I'm not looking to be a sugar daddy and not looking to hook up right away, although if there is a connection we would both know. Ideally grab a beer somewhere, or coffee and go from there. Now I put this in this section to weed out the riffraff and talk to serious inquiries only. I will gladly share pics and expect the same. If you are looking to play games go to the casual encounters section. Now if you have read this far and are looking for an older FWB possibility, hit me up.

Hi there :)
I'm searching to try to find someone in a similar situation. I'm currently in a relationship but it has its good/bad days. Looking for someone who might be in the same boat (whether you're married, dating whatever) and maybe we can develop an amazing friendship :)

I'm a college student- so a texting buddy would be nice. Please don't reply if you have to run and hide from your wife or girlfriend just to text someone. I live in Iowa (Des Moines) so you won't have to worry about running into me anywhere. The main reason I'm posting in a different state is because I mainly want a texting friend. I would be open to meeting up with someone if we do get that connection, though. I'll be graduating in a month, so maybe you might know a few connections for me in my job search.. that's always a plus! :)

Please don't reply if you're just going to send a couple messages then be done.. I actually want to build a friendship with someone.

All ages welcome. I tend to gravitate to older people in my friends circle. If you're still there, shoot me an email with your location in the subject. :)

I'm looking for someone to email with throughout the day. Does not have to be all day, every day, but just enough to keep a connection with. Looking for someone who is perhaps interested in the same things I am, but certainly open to a dialogue about most anything except sexting. No problem with talking about kink and all the enjoyment that may bring, but I'm not looking for XXX correspondence. 

I'm in my early thirties, professional, and love a lot of so-called 'nerdy' things: some video games, graphic novels, board games. Also very much into literature and music. I used to be pretty adventurous, but lately have been playing it safe. I'm a fairly independent person with a somewhat wild streak at times. 

I'm not really looking to meet up with anyone yet, but if we connect, I wouldn't be opposed to it. 

Ideally, I'm looking for a guy around 27-40 to email with, but if you're a little younger or a little older, I'd be okay as long as we had similar interests. I'm happily married and not looking for any side action - sometimes it's just nice to talk with the opposite sex with no major strings attached. Not looking for someone who would be an emotional crutch. I understand you have a life and while we get to know each other, I won't just dump my daily woes or frustrations on you and expect you to baby me. 

It'd be great if you email more than just 'hi, how r u'. If interested, please respond with a favorite movie in the header, a little banter, and we'll go from there.

And not that it matters but I'm 31, unattached, tall and not a bad looking guy, and a good listener/asker of questions. While I would not rule out the possibility of meeting up at some point, it's not why I'm posting this.

I also don't do any drugs, not even 420. I like spa days, tea and have been known to have tea parties lol, cooking/baking, happy hour, groupons etc. Fun things I've done in the past: I fenced foil/sabre for a very short while. I've ziplined and skydived. I love roller coasters, animals, thrift stores as well as nice shops. I love berry picking in the summertime. Cirque du Soleil. Plants and flowers/gardening. I've always wanted to attend a Comic-Con and a MommyCon.

Hello,
I am a good upstanding guy in my community in an open type LTR meaning I flirt, party and hang out with the opposite sex but don't have sex.

This open thing is a mutual agreement with my partner (unlike some people who say they are in an open relationship without telling the other person).

I also have a wicked side in that I like bump and grind, get tattoos, drink, 420, listen to country, rap, industrial and metal, go to bondage clubs nights, gay bars and clubs. 

So if you are looking for someone to let out your wild side who is also loyal and respectful and knows how to let out the beast, doesn't try to pressure you and actually gives a sh*t about you, I'm your man.

You: 25-48, LTR OK as long as you are transparent with them and me. 
Like music (anything OK from metal to jazz to country)
OK with drinking, flirting and getting stupid but also OK with just getting coffee or 'boring' stuff like going out to eat and talking or working out.
Open minded about sexuality and society, not a judge first, ask questions later type

It would probably help if we had some things in common (or maybe it would make things interesting if we had nothing in common at all?). You are ideally between 27-37, live a somewhat healthy lifestyle and are able to hold a conversation.

Pictures are not required but if you feel so inclined then I promise to send one in return.

Happy Friday!

Hello, to start off I am very real... I live in the Twin Cities and am a loyal Vikes fan! 

I am looking to find a cuddle buddy. Someone that wants to feel close to another-without the whole relationship aspect of things. I would love to find someone that wants to lay together (you host), watch a movie, and just enjoy the closeness. I am not looking for sex and am not at a point where a relationship is a good idea. I am single and you need to be also. I don't have a ton of free time but would like to meet up a couple times a month. Please be around 30 years old, give or take a couple years. I am 5' 7"", 218lb, white. If you're looking for a situation such as this lets start with a few emails and see where it goes.

So I didn't grow up in Minnesota and don't have family here who would have had a cabin on a lake up north somewhere. I feel like I'm missing out. I thought I might as well see if there's a single woman (or man) out there near my age who has a family cabin and would like company. 

I'm not looking for anything sexual. Just a quiet place to get away occasionally and someone to enjoy it with. 

I'm a 40 year old divorced male (two kids, but they're only with me half the time). I'm a quiet introvert who enjoys reading and drawing and photography. I'm also a lover of the outdoors--hiking, camping, just sitting and enjoying nature. I'm a Christian (not that it matters) and I don't smoke or do drugs.

Make me reimburse you or meet you at the auto shop to pay for it and sign all the paperwork making me responsible. You and the auto guys can all have a laugh if you want.

This is a serious offer. Though getting used is a fetish, it's one that I can accomplish in entirely platonic circumstances. You can basically ignore me until I need to pay and then have a laugh. I'm good for $1,000 or more per year as long as it's over time so enjoy yourself.

Here is a little bit about me. I am 25. I am engaged. I have no kids. I don't smoke or do drugs. I work full time and I am a full time grad student. I will be taking the summer off from school, so I will have quite a bit more free time. :]
I am outgoing once I am comfortable around people. I can be a bit sarcastic. I am a loyal friend. I love to travel as much as much as possible. I am a crafty person. I enjoy scrapbooking, card making, and other random DIY projects. I love music and going to concerts whenever I can. I love going thrift store shopping, binge watching things on Netflix, and going out to eat to try new foods. I enjoy game nights, going out for a drink every now and again, movies, and bowling. I love to cook and I really want to host a dinner party sometime!
If I seem like someone you might get along with feel free to send me a message. Please don't message me if you are a flake. I can't stand making plans and constantly being told that the person can't make it. I understand that things come up, but this has been a consistent issue and all I ask for is a little heads up.

I work a normal 8-5 job and on the side I teach yoga.. Hot yoga to be exact.

The older we get, the more difficult it becomes to make new friends. So a number of years ago a few of us decided to start a women's group for straight, single, active, senior women to get together for lunch once a month as well as other activities. Our membership is limited to 12 members and now we find a need to replace one of them. We want to keep our group small and friendly. We're a group of senior women who have found this to be a great way to make new female friends. It's a community based group with most members living in the northwestern suburbs ~~ Robbinsdale, Crystal, New Hope, Brooklyn Center, Brooklyn Park, Maple Grove, Plymouth and Golden Valley. But if you live outside this area and don't mind driving a distance to join us, you're more than welcome!

Some of our members created a 4-some that meets twice a month to play 500. Two other members found they had an interest in common ~~ going antiquing and to estate sales, so they enjoy this together. Two other members enjoy the casino, so they've become casino buddies. If you have a special interest, a member of our group may have it as well. These women were strangers before they joined our group. Now they've made new friends.

There is no membership fee. Your only expense is whatever the cost is for your lunch or event. Our next activity is lunch at a restaurant in Maple Grove in April. Usually about 5 or 6 members attend ~~ small, informal and friendly.

If you're uncomfortable meeting a group of people that you don't know, I'll be happy to meet you for coffee at a public location so at least you'll have met one person. This is an opportunity to expand your circle of friends. Just respond to this ad with the subject line of Gals All Together and I'll get back to you with additional information about our group.


(This ad will be removed once the opening for the new member has been filled.)

We haven't had sex yet and I don't plan to as I only have sex with long term partners. The thing is, he is really wanting sex. I am not there yet, so he has requested a hall pass of sorts. He would like to find a ""side"" woman strictly for sex but maintain the arrangement he and I have. Originally, I agreed to it, but am beginning to feel uncomfortable. I don't quite know what to do and am looking for advice. Do I just get over it and give him the pass? Do I put my foot down and say no? Is this just a sign that our arrangement has run its course? Any advice?

I'm sure some will be tempted to hurl insults in my direction. I am not interested. I know I may seem naive or fussy. Keep your insults to yourself. If you have constructive comments, even if they seem harsh or tough, I look forward to hearing from you.

Okay... Some would think its sad to post an ad on CL for a friend. But lets be honest, after college, where do you meet new friends? Work? Sure, if you're lucky. I work for a small office and the two other women are old enough to be my mother. So, where do you go?

I am 30. In a committed relationship with my boyfriend of 7 years. He has a great group of friends. Sadly all of my awesome gal pals moved away and the few friends I have left near me (closer than 30 minutes) are all getting married or having babies. 

I want to find someone who I can go to happy hour with. Or sit at home and laugh while we share a bottle of wine (or 2). I enjoy going out from time to time but just relaxing in (maybe doing a craft or watching a movie) sounds better. Even doing something as simple as a book club ( everyone reads a book that interests you, then we talk about it when we get together).

If you are looking for a down to earth friend (no romantic interests at all), who is a good listener and genuinely cares, send me an email.

Hey there,

It's a pretty chilly Saturday and I'd like to find a new female smoke buddy.

I'm not looking for anything sexual but if there's mutual attraction that's fine with me. 

I'm white, 6'4, larger build & fairly muscular, ddf, educated, employed, and live with a few roommates in the west metro. 

Since my housemates aren't too keen on the smell, I'd prefer if we could meet somewhere to smoke, or I could drive to your place. 

I typically go for white/Asian women but I'm open to other ethnicities. As log as you're over 18, I'm fine with all ages as well.

If you're interested reply with a recent face picture and hopefully we can meet and smoke today!

Ok. A gorgeous day to roll up my sleeves and take on CL. After all, for us men especially it is a fiercely competitive domain! ;) 

A few words first about ""strictly platonic"". I am posting here because I want to start out by learning to know someone. Think emails, kik chat, etc. Like a fair number of other people here, I am attached and not looking to change my situation. I do, however, want chemistry and connection. And I want to start off discovering if that is really there. Down the road I am open to a conversation about whether coffee or drinks might be an option. 

Even online conversation requires attraction and mutual curiosity. So here is a bit about me: I am intellectually active and I thoroughly enjoy quality conversation. I believe in ""sound mind in a sound body"" wisdom so I exercise regularly and read widely. Hopefully you are thin to fit and value emotional connection? Being a vibrant, compassionate human being matters to me. Perhaps you too? Age and race open.

If you're relationship is something like this or even remotely like this then I could really use a woman's perspective. 

Posting here because I am genuine and sincere, no ulterior motives - which has often been said I'm sure with exactly the opposite in mind. Just trust there are at least a few of the good guys left. The kind of guy who in HS was everyone's ""friend"" but later in life turned out to be someone everyone trusted and counted on, that's me.

I remember life before marriage. Before children. I remember longing for one another constantly. Just holding one another all night and nothing else in the world seemed to matter. I remember loving one another with every ounce of our being. I remember lusting for one another (at minimum) daily. I remember staring in her eyes on our first date and knowing, without a doubt, I was staring into the futute. I remember passion. 
And then the first child came. And then the rings went on our fingers. And then life began. A life filled with love for one another and our children. A life we we had both dreamed of. A life we worked so hard to attain. A life filled with frustration. A life filled with exhaustion. A life devoid of sex. A life without the expression of that passion we once shared. 
I love my wife with all of my heart. I love my children with every ounce of my being. I look in their eyes and know, without a doubt, I see the future. I see graduations, and weddings, and grandchildren. I see a life worth living. A life worth being proud of. But I miss sex. I miss (the occasional) moments of irresponsibility with minimal consequences. I miss lust. I miss the passion.
I have no idea why I posted. I have no idea what my intentions or motives are. Maybe this resonates with you? Maybe you'd like to chat? I'm never opposed to making a new friend, and I love to learn about other people and hear their stories. I guess if you'd like to chat, drop me a note. I hope you're having an awesome night!

Good morning. My name is Beth, and I am looking for a man to take me on a date.

I am transgendered, and live part-time as a woman. I don't pass real well, but I try to blend in, and I am often accepted as who I appear to be - a tall middle-aged woman. 

The man I go on a date with will be between 45 and 60, intelligent and articulate, well-educated, have a sense of humor, know how to dress for the occasion, and be respectful of me and other women.

Email if interested. Pictures appreciated and will get mine. Dick pics will be deleted, out of age range will be deleted.

I have seen you drive to, I assume, work a couple times a week now going on a few months. Only occasionally have I seen you heading North. Should this be in Missed Connections, you can make that argument. But I might get more ""looks"" in here. You are stunning, a classic eastern European look to you..Russian maybe? You are a brunette. 40'ish..You drive a newer Toyota Camry. You have no idea who I am, we have never made eye contact.. not from trying and looking. Maybe I will have to use my horn next time. I notice you usually around the Plymouth/ Golden Valley area when we start to crawl on that wonderful road.

I'm looking for another repressed married guy with a PG-13 life to enjoy some MA activities.

I have friends and family but I have not kept up with buddies from high school and I was married when I went to college so basically, I've never really had an erection in front of anyone other than my wife, ex-wife and a few girlfriends. Now my wife has basically been my world for 23 years is post-menopausal and does not want anything to do with my erections.

St Croix valley stepmom, uninterested in mommy groups, or goody two shoes mommy warriors. knows from experience that others just don't get it. Painful reality; learned the hard way not to share my thoughts & experience with DH. Skids are tween: in for a rough decade ahead. Help me stay married by blowing steam with you. 

We could be occasional lunch or shopping buddies (though I don't actually shop much, just an excuse to see a friend). - by occasional I mean only every couple of months or less. I'm not needy, or looking for daily face to face contact. A texting friendship works great with me , once we hit it off, I'd not feel neglected if we only ""saw"" each other hardly at all. It's just nice to have someone local to call when furious, but gotta swallow it because of reasons only another stepmom understands.

Then again, if we became new BFFs, maybe we have drinks regularly? I have no real agenda or expectation. 

NOT interested in cheating, or partying behind DH back. Just want local female stepmom friend to cry and laugh with. NO MEN. No religious nuts, no teetotalers. No bio moms; you think you get it, but you don't.

Usually I find the idea of boredom as novel.... Who can think of nothing to do in a world full of endless things to do, but I think my problem is that I've got no one to do it with, and I work a very people person job. So I'm off for the week and rather than do all the things I complain about never having the time to do, like laundry, mop and do paperwork I decided I'd come on here to see if anyone is feeling the same way. We can go for coffee or a walk, play uno or whatever we can think up. I'm married, so I suppose you either have to be ok with that or have a horrible memory. I do have pics I can exchange.....

I just completed divorce proceedings last spring. Not quite a year ago. (Maybe throwing our the baggage right away will help save some people some time :) ) My friends and family have been asking if I'm looking to meet someone new or when that would be and I just figured I'd know when the time was right. And to be honest, I miss having someone tell me how funny I am lol

Seriously though, there is just something special about women. Im financially secure and have enough of my ducks in a row, but I miss the thrill of secret kisses, of seeing a new text, of finding out what makes her world beautiful and figuring out new ways to become a part of that. So, as it turns out, I want to meet someone. Someone who can LITERALLY Netflix and chill at first and can understand my wanting to look before I leap. Sexuality will definitely be a part of my future, but I want it to be after I have some trust and context. Call me boring. Sex is way better when you get to know what makes them wild and when they want just as badly to bring you there with them.

Me: white, early 30's, reasonably fit, short brown hair (full head still!), blue eyes, dimples.

You? Probably under 40, race is open, body shape is open... Just be funny, smart, reasonably self aware... Gotta be able to take a joke and have a comically thick skin. Im one who 'goes there' with all manner of iff color humor. So be warned.

Lets just spend some time with the newness of it all and see if we both end up preferring eachother :)

I am looking for someone around 31 to 37. 
I am looking for someone who would be interesting in hiking, actually hiking, Minnehaha Falls or Afton State Park. I jog the back trails. Dirt. I jog about a constant ten minute mile for about an hour. I break half way for five minutes. 
I am looking for someone who would want to go fishing. 
I am looking for someone who can teach me new things. Golf. I am a beginning to learn. And I fail at life; I am serious. Batting cages. Tennis. Etc. 
I want someone who has to have running water while camping. I have standards. You should too. 
I want someone who can have a pizza, a board game and movie night, but not the board games which last a million years. 
Someone who is a Republican. I am not interested in having debates. I am to old to put up with noise. 
Someone who will leave a Twins game, if it sucks, for dinner and a movie. 
I have been through a lot, and I am starting over. It is not so bad; I have no debt including my student loans from my bachelor's degree. My life is transitioning for the first time in four years. 
I am not going to describe myself for dating, but to be friends, friends need to feel comfortable including appearance. I am pretty. I am not gorgeous or cute. Tall. Between thin and average. Curly red Bob between shoulders and chin. Know to dress for the occasion. Groomed. I am more Old Hollywood than Kim Kardashian. Less is more. More is for expensive places on rare occasions.

I am a genuine, professional, normal guy in my earlier thirties. I have for a considerable period of time had meetings with cuck couples who've been into the lifestyle in varying degrees, varying from purely voyeuristic to clean up and fluffing, all of which have been great but........PLEASE IM NOT LOOKING FOR 1 NIGHT STAND IM ONLY LOOKING FOR LONG TERM CUCKHOLD COUPLE

I'd now like to meet a couple with whom I can build an ongoing three way relationship with, within mutually agreeable limits, that really explores the joy that such a trusted relationship can bring.
I am a subscriber to the view that this is so much more than just physical, that it is a lifestyle choice and that one's mind is as much an erogenous zone as ones body and that only when both are addressed can true release be achieved. It is so good to delve into the imagination and emasculation of the sissy cuck, with his wife that he's no longer capable of fulfilling........just providing the elements for her to share pleasure with her new bull who gives her what she needs.

I do also revel in the opportunity to let imagination run amok, obviously within agreed limits, and ensure that Sissy is trained within her new role, that of preparation, service, submissiveness and denial whilst enjoying unadulterated, carnal and hedonistic pleasure with his hot wife that he's no longer capable of satisfying.


I'd be very happy to exchange mail, chat or meet to discuss and would be delighted to hear from you should you be interested in exploring this further.If you are interested do let me know, forwarding contact details and thoughts, and I'll be happy to provide contact details as required by return and we can arrange to discuss.

I look forward to hearing from you

I had no idea where to classify this because I'm not looking for sex or romance but no more than friends kinda...
I'm very busy and travel a lot. And yes I'm lonely but not in a pathetic sense, it's just currently I don't have any one close. I simply want to relax, cuddle, talk, laugh, and that's about it. Older, younger, doesn't matter, body type doesn't matter either but I prefer smaller curvier women with a soft place to rest my head :) 
This should not be misunderstood for something more, not that I don't want or like ""more"" just that I have to be very close to someone intimately first. Also, please believe that this isn't a plot for sex or something weird or whatever you're speculating, it's as innocent as it sounds and I will make it worth your time, I promise.

I have a question for the ladies here. I recently started talking to a woman from OKC. We chatted for about a week, flirted, laugh and good chats. We decided to meet last Sat to go bowling. We met and she smiled and I smiled. She was cute. We bowled a couple of games, laughed, had a good time even shared a few ""touches"" through out the night. So before the night ended I asked her if she had a good time and if she would like to go out again. She said yes. I offered to make her dinner and she seemed to love the idea. So at the end of the night I walked her to her car and reached to give her a hug and she leaned in to kiss me. I reciprocated with a ""nice"" kiss goodnight.

I asked that she shoot me a text when she got home (we had a couple of drinks) she told me she would. When she got back to me I told her thanks' for the nice night, that I had a good time and looked forward to Tuesday. I guess I also told her I thought she was Sexy. She said she had a great time and thought I was cute also. On Sunday we did not talk, I sent her a message yesterday just saying "" Hope you are having a good day"". She sent me a message stating that she was sick and had pink eye in both eye's. I was wondering if I should be taking that as a hint that she did not want to meet again. I asked her about it and she told me that she had fun, thought I was cute but did not feel any connection.

So I guess the question here is mostly for the single ladies. What are your expectations when you go out on a date? Do you have to have that immediate connection? What makes you want a second date. I guess I ask myself two questions. One did I have fun, and secondly did I think she was cute? If the answer to those two questions is yes I ask for a second date. I guess I just think putting all the pressure on one date to have a connection it really doesn't give anything a chance. Especially if you enjoyed yourself. Connections take time to grow.

So I am sure you can guess that I kinda liked this girl. We had fun, some great chat's online and on the phone, seemed to have several things in common.. I guess I'm just confused. I don't understand women. lol

Yes, I'm attached but I'm not looking to change my situation for you or have you change yours for me. In spite of being married, I've definitely been very lonely for quite some time. Basically, we're really just roommates at this point. Sound familiar?

I'm very safe/sane/normal, considered attractive by most (g-rated pics available), and very much for real. I'm ideally looking for someone in a similar situation to mine with whom I might be able to develop a friendship and see where that takes us.

My only ""must haves"" regarding you are that you be a non-smoker, 100% ddf with an understanding and agreement to be completely discreet about our friendship. I don't care if you're in the south suburbs or not, but please at least be somewhere in the Twin Cities region!

Seriously. There are hundreds of postings on here, all saying the same thing.

""MWM, doesn't want to change things at home"" ... No kidding!

""Looking for a friend, a discreet one"" ... because a normal friend is too blabby LOL!

""Huge married cock needs a ride"" ... Cripes! His cock is married, but he's not?

""Are you compasionate and sensitive?"" - Spell check please!

And I didn't don't even go near the Casual Encounters for fear of catching a disease or two.
Can that even happen?

But ... where do we turn? We can't hit on our hot married neighbor next door. We can't really let our friends know about this and have them hook us up. Bars! Well, so here we are right? Married. Unfulfilled. On Craigslist with the rest dregs of society and a few normal ones like us. Right?

I'm not stuck on myself, I promise. I'm just particular I guess. This is dangerous territory that we're treading through ... I want to make sure it's with the right person. Quality over quantity.

So, if you're married too and you just haven't found what you want, give me a shout ... you never know.

Please be attractive, in shape ... age/race doesn't matter ... and fun to chat with. I do want to get to know you before we go further.

I'm never totally sure how to start a conversation here, know what I mean? Seems funny to just say hey let's a grab a drink or dinner? But I guess we have to start somewhere. I thought about cranking out a funny pickup line or two...something like:

Is your name Google? Because you're everything I've been looking for!

Pretty lame I know...I promise they get better.

I promise I am normal. Maybe grab a drink? If you are married and looking for a nice professional guy to connect with, give me a shot. I am married as well and can understand your situation. I'd love to listen to you tell me all about your frustrations and work.

I am a Geek/Nerd and I wholeheartedly accept it. Sadly not everyone does though. My passions include Lego's, some models, Sci-fy TV shows and movies, board games, Tolkien, The Marvel Comic Universe, and a few other things. With that being said, I do have a normal Mon-Fri day time job and I do have other hobbies and friends. I'm just trying to say that I'm not a complete weirdo or anything. I'm just someone who has a passion and wants to share it with other like minded people.

I am looking for any fellow geeks/nerds that might want to chat and get to know each other. We can talk about our passions and help each other get through the day. I am married which is why this is posted in the strictly platonic area. Your status doesn't really matter to me. I am really just looking for fellow geeks to talk with.

If this is you, then send me a message. I hope to hear from you.

I seem to be running into the same trouble as a lot of other people are lately. Getting a little stir crazy and ready for the weather to warm up just a little bit more so we can finally get outside. And today's snow really isn't helping. LOL. 

I wanted to see if anyone out there wanted to chat and help pass the time. Potentially looking for an ongoing chat friendship. Topics of conversation can be about anything. I am a pretty laid back guy and don't pass any judgments. I have lots of the normal hobbies and interests that everyone else seems to have. With a few others thrown in there for good measure. I can hold my own in a conversation about most topics and enjoy learning new things.  

I am happily married and not looking to change that. Really just looking for a friend to chat with. Your status doesn't really matter to me as long as you are respectful. If you are in the same place as me and interested in a new friend then I hope to hear from you.

I am looking for someone to spend an evening with once a week or so, maybe a phone call a week and some nice texts during the week, things to keep the connection alive and feeling real. I am looking for a casual but loyal friendship with clear communication and boundaries. In other words, saying yes or no is respected. 

I want us to be able to flirt once in a while, commiserate about friends, family and partners, discuss sexual identities and the challenges they bring, hit the movies, club or coffee shop.

I put this ad under ""strictly platonic"" because that is all I am looking for until friendship is established.

However, given time, if our partners agree and we are interested, there are always doors to more involvement such as phone sex, mutual masturbation or increased sexual attachment and intimacy. 

I am bisexual, exploring polyamory at some level, sex positive, and like to play with androgyny and cross dressing. I am also interested in music, art, philosophy and avant garde cinema

I am a married man who works in a creative field and miss connecting with a female who thinks and works in a similar way. My wife works a desk job and doesn't understand what I do. Don't misunderstand this... I am no slouch and work hard in my field and make most of our income. But our frustrations come in over her desire for routine and my need for creative space and time. 
I am just curious if anyone feels this way. I don't even know if we will ever meet but I would love to have someone to talk with who may think similarly. Feel free to tell me about yourself and send a photo if you want. It is nice to know who you are talking to but I understand if you prefer anonymity.

I am looking for is a friend that I can email or text durning the day and maybe meet for dinner or lunch someday, but not right away. 
My ideal match is a married or attached women between 25-43.

Are you married and missing something in your relationship and are searching for attention both physical and emotional? Guess what? SO AM I !!! Yes I know it's strange but us guys too go through it too. I am married and relationship went cold. Just need someone to talk to , cuddle with , and if it does get physical why not. I'm a normal guy that is looking for that SPECIAL friend to flirt with and get physical too. I love caressing and feeling how a woman's body feels and trembles with pleasure when she's given the proper attention. I don't care about your height, weight , or how you look as long as we both understand each other's needs. I'd prefer that you are able to host or have a place we can meet during the day. Days work best for me and can travel just about anywhere in the twin cities. I'd also prefer you live within the cities or around there. I've had responses before but not really what I'm looking for. I am as real as the Minnesota Vikings. Send me an email with your description of yourself and please try include a pic if possible so I know you are real as I am. In subject line please include today's date so I know you are real. No subject line I will not respond and your email will go to trash bin!!! Good luck n hope to hear from you soon. ;)

I'm looking for a woman in her late 30s or early 40s to talk to and get to know.

Hello there!

I have a few questions:

Are you tired of being ghosted?
are you sick of feeling out of place at meetups that are really just groups of friends going out without the intended intention of the group?
do you want to make a friend while being yourself and not pretending to be polite?

Well I have a somewhat odd and somewhat childish proposition!

A BLIND PLAY-DATE!!!!

Meeting someplace like the Zoo or the MOA and getting to know each other while having fun!
Please email me ONLY if you are seriously interested. i dont want to exchange emails on occasion to plan something and then eventually not do anything. If you dont have much going on in life then i would reccomend this. I am offering possible friendship at the risk of meeting a serial killer. 
so please take a chance on this silly girl!

so yeah.

Firstly a huge thank you for reading this. I am looking to find a new friend who ideally is looking for someone to communicate as a change from everyday life, some magic, all platonic and this is about friendship but if things develop over time just because of a cracking friendship then they do but I am hoping to find just a great new friend in my life. You can be married or not I am fine with both.

I know the friend I am looking for, this would be a kind happy person, open to what life has to offer, not blinded in either direction and who is a wonderful caring friend that I can communicate with and will enjoy conversations and be available to relax but who is also very romantic at heart and loves the finer things in life, dinner, theatre, opera, classical and all types of music, with an excellent sense of humor, smart and intelligent, reliable and loves real romance that a friendship can bring sometimes. I like someone with ambition in life a desire who enjoys life and a will to succeed. I am just looking for an awesome new friend.

So what can I tell you about me that will stimulate your interest in some form or another? I am from the United Kingdom, 6ft 2"" tall, medium build, attractive (so I am told), auburn short smart hair, blue eyes, professional person with a lovely outgoing personality, I am an active and professional person and have always been so, I enjoy having fun that's so important in life, I love culture and history but then having grown up in England it's hard not to with castles and the like everywhere. 

I am looking for someone to meet up with for lunches, dinners and drinks, catch a movie, or do lots of other fun things in the area. I am new to Minneapolis area so I am enjoying seeing all but currently finding I am getting cabin fever just stuck in. 

I truly enjoy talking and telling stories (of which I must warn you I have and endless supply!), just thought I better tell you... For my career I am a business owner and love it, I truly enjoy my work and the leisure time it provides me also.

Please write more than one or two line reply if you really want me to show interest, if you have a photo that would be nice too...

MGTOW, or men going their own way, are referred to as men who are frustrated with the lack of incentives to date who choose to opt-out of dating and focus on taking care of themselves.

This may be a little odd to be posting here, but I'm looking for something fairly specific and not sure what to expect.

I'm a married guy in my early thirties. I've been married for a few years now and the spark at home in the bedroom is mostly gone. We've tried to bring it back but it's been rocky to say the least.

I love my wife deeply and I don't want to change our situation. I'm to the point where I just need more fun in the bedroom. I know that might seem selfish and I know that what I'm doing (even by posting this) isn't exactly honorable, but I'm curious, too.

Ideally, I'm looking for someone that understands where I'm coming from or respects my situation. Again, I'm not looking to change my situation at home. I'd like to get to know someone through email first and see where things lead. I'm in no rush to find someone on the same page as me.

I thought I would give this a try. I'm a straight guy in my 30's, down to earth and thought it would be great to find a nice in-shape guy, 30-45 to connect with as friends, who'd also enjoy having a cuddle-buddy for a non-sexual friendship. I was able to experience this a few years back and thought it would be strange, but it was a great experience. This is not an opportunity for sex, and not just limited to cuddling. I'm a good conversationalist and listener, and looking for the same who is comfortable with themselves to do this. White, Asian, Latino, it doesn't matter. The hand of friendship has no color. Not your typical ad I know, but would be great to find a nice, cool guy who'd enjoy the same. Maybe watch a movie or a game? Tell me more about yourself in your reply. Serious replies only please.

This is pretty simple - I would like to go and see the new Batman v. Superman movie with someone. No pressure, just a movie and perhaps a bite to eat after. Going to the movies alone is nowhere near as fun as having someone to discuss it with afterward.

While meeting someone similar to me might be comfortable, I want the opposite. I want to be uncomfortable with you. I want what you are to be in such stark contrast to how I am, that we could be candidates for the Maury shows when he has disparate couples on.

I am a nature loving, commerce and corporate profit hating, all weather Bicycle riding, junk food eating, novelty loving, frivolity hating, hard laboring, obscenity using, simple living Man. I'm more likely to join in activities that have little cost, and involve Nature, than I am in spending obscene amounts at some crappy establishment. I have no tattoos, or piercings. I will never marry, or have children. Ok... I MIGHT have children, but I doubt that ANY Woman would agree to the terms I would require.

If reading what I put down about myself causes a visceral reaction in you, then send me a message.

It is my intent to spend one hour per week, or month, with you, and discuss anything and everything that we care to. Hopefully we have some heated conversations. We will always meet in a public place and not share any identifying information about each other. No matter what you say, I will still want to meet periodically, barring any unforeseen event that is.

Things I don't give a FUCK about: Age, relationship status, race, looks, or ""income.""

Or would it be Spousal-Attention-Deficit-Disorder? Hmm?

So why the ad you ask? Simple, I got to thinking that I might as well chat with others that feel the same way - that just don't get the attention they deserve from their SO. I have heard that this is a great place to look. Some say there are more than a few of us here.

I hope to hear back from someone who is inquisitive, open minded, educated, smart, well-read and yes, you guessed it - married. You should have a playful sense of humor, and a little sarcasm can go a long way as well. I am open to making new friends if nothing more. 

If you're interested in getting to know me, you would have to like good-looking guys that are smart and funny, have a lot of energy, honest (other than the obvious), confident, and have been known to be a little bit naughty. I have a nice smile, brown hair, blue eyes, I am 5' 10"" 180 lbs, I work out almost everyday and I think I look pretty good for an old guy (36)!

Tell me a bit about you, your looks (be as descriptive as you can), your situation. How long have you been married? How long have you been thinking about looking around? Have you done this before? What city do you live in? I understand the need for discretion, so if not the exact city, one that is near you. Also tell me something that I would find interesting about you.

I am available to chat over email most days while I am at work, and in the evenings after my wife and children have retired for the night. We are getting ahead of ourselves here, but I thought it should be mentioned that I am able to make myself available in the evenings when needed.

Let's get this party started!

Not looking for anything outside of friendship, just am a grown man that was raised by and loved without the active involvement of a father or other male relatives.
I'm not searching for any specific type, and have only prejudice, illegal tendencies, lack of self-control and laziness as deal-breakers.
My activities are diverse, but don't have any experience or skill at video games/rpg's, or ""role-playing"" of any kind.
I'm active summer-time hiker, but need a woman who will help me keep from getting lost in activities like hiking hugely effective terrain like Lebanon Hills.
I'm not opposed to traveling a bit to meet up with someone worth it, I have driven all over the country and into Canada. 
My job gives me unlimited vacation time if I give them at least 2 weeks notice.
I have the patience, perseverance and dexterity needed to fish, just never met someone that both knew enough and was enough my style to ever start.
I'm a reserved and self-restrained man who is privately an open book, publicly more of a great listener than talker.
I'm surrounded by University students that haven't lived enough to have similar perspectives and common interests. I don't drink anymore and I've been to and done Virginia Beach, Freaknik(twice), Panama City, Little Havana and didn't need to go to Cancun with Galveston having all the same festivities.
That lifestyle offers no appeal to me anymore.
If you are a self-confident, self-aware and active woman anywhere from 35-50, then this 46 year old man would love to discover the Midwest with you at the helm.
Doesn't matter if it's North/South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska or Illinois.

I am looking for a connection. Depending on the type of connection we have we may take walks, share affection/human touch, go to dinner, happy hour on a patio, theater, orchestra hall and many more. I am hoping to meet someone that can talk about real life, help each other figure things out and offer a different perspective, I like real, genuine people. 

I am an introvert/mellow, practical, analytical, Christian, spiritual, reliable - you don't have to be just like me, but I've heard it said and believe that people tend to like people that are like them - their temperament and values.

I'm not looking for a lot of responses, please be intentional about responding and telling me about you and what you are interested in. Interested in an unattached/single man, roughly 39-52 for platonic connection. 

Happy Easter!

I am very down to earth, real, and just an average guy. I'm 36 work a full time professional job. I work out 5-7 days a week and love to go biking. I enjoy hiking as well as walks around the lakes and basically anything physical. Im very fit and enjoy being active. 

Im young looking, I have a great attitude and very positive! 

I would love to meet friends that I can work out with, go on walks and hikes with, I also have property up north and would love to find people to go camping and fishing with. 

I am very open minded so if you have suggestions about fun things to do please feel free to provide your imput! 

Hope to hear back from someone. I guess I don't have an age preference, just please be mature and respectful. 

If there is anyone free today, feel free to say hello. Also I actually want to meet up and hang out. Not really looking for a ""text"" or ""email"" buddy 😀

Loneliness can be a curse, but can also be a blessing. I've thought a great deal about this, and I'd like to meet an honest, attractive, friendly, smart woman for conversation and feedback, once a mutual trust has been established. Coffee, walks, even shopping would be appropriate places to meet when schedules permit. This is not a romantic opportunity. I simply seek a sensible and sincere woman of whom I can appreciate her worldview and sense of humor. I need a friend. Age is less important, though experience tells me women over the age of 40 generally have more to offer.

Hello, 
So, I have been reading the posts from married men looking for married women. Because I was trying to get an idea of what to say in mine. And the men all sound so desperate. It's the same thing. ""We lost the passion, the romance, I feel like were just roommates"". I get it, most of us that are married and looking on CL, men and women, probably do feel that way. But, man can we get a little more articulate, or creative or maybe even just bit more honest? At least pretend to be happy. I feel like I should respond to these guys and try talking them off the ledge. :)

Okay, yes, I feel all of those things too. So I'm just going to say what excites me about posting here. I get excited when I connect with someone. Someone that's not afraid to share whatever comes to their mind. I get excited to see an email in my inbox from that person. I'll admit that it puts a little bounce in my step and makes my day a little brighter. I feel good knowing that person is looking for my email too. And yes, I would like to meet someone and have some fun with. Hopefully we hit it off, laugh and look forward to getting emails and just keeping it low key. Is this more of a rant than a post?

I'm a nice looking guy. Working professional. I take care of myself and eat right. But I wouldn't pass up a plate of wings either. But most of all, I'm very normal. I'm just missing a little of that human touch. 

I hope to hear from someone that knows where I'm coming from. :)

I moved to MN about 8 years ago; since then I have not met women that I connect with outside of my professional life. And there are limits about what one can talk about with colleagues--even those you really dig! I miss my high school gf's with whom I could speak about ANY topic. No worries about being PC. We can just be ourselves. But I only see them once a year...

Here is a little bit about me... I am 40-something but feel 20-something. Single, responsible, healthy, well educated, fun-loving. I work full time in a great field in Saint Paul and have lived in Eagan for three months now. I like to write in my free time. (I'm an aspiring author, i.e, unpublished, but working on it.) I enjoy music, walking for fun and fitness, going out to eat, trying new cocktails, watching movies...

I get along with most people, but prefer the company of women who are witty, attractive, smart and fun, 35-45. I don't talk about the weather. Prefer to alternate between purely entertaining and edgy discussion and substantive idea sharing. 

I have two teens who are great and a boyfriend who suits me, I just want to find a [platonic] female to hang out with from time to time. Preferably in Eagan or Saint Paul.

If this works, I will be both delighted and surprised! :)

Hi Craigslist,

I need some help. 

My wife and I are recovering from a major relationship issue from the past when she decided to have sexual relations with other men. I want to say I'm over it, but deep down inside, I feel like I'm really not. We're in a good spot today, but I know there's still some things she's not telling me because she KNOWS it'll hurt me if she shares that information. I supposedly already know a lot she tells me, like 80-90%. This secret though, the final 10-20%, it pains me, and she tells me some things are better left unknown. I want to believe her, I want to trust her, but what she's asking for is a HUGE ask I feel.

I just don't know if i will ever truly get over it if I don't get the 100%. I feel like it'll loom over my shoulders forever otherwise, but I only time will tell?

My question is, should I really just let it go? If so, how the hell do I even do that? After her most recent share about what she's done (late last night), I've been having nasty images of her and another man on replay in my head all day and it just makes my heart drop. Am I in the wrong to be feeling this way? Is what I'm feeling justified? I mean, she's here with me now, she did choose to stay with me, but why do I still feel this way? There's just so much going on I'm not sure what to think of it. I love my wife and I think she's beautiful, but I'm think I'm reaching a threshold I didn't know was there before?

Anyway, if you've read this far already, please provide some insight to your thoughts about my perception of my relationship. I really need some help and can't carry this alone. If you're wondering, I've shared how I've felt with my wife, but she dismisses my points and can't empathize with me. She's closed that chapter in her life and has moved on, I want to do the same, but for me, it's so much harder and I can't understand why. I'm beginning to think I'm experiencing some PTSD or something.

I'm working at home today. Bored stiff. I also had a fun date over the weekend, so I'm feeling just a little revved up and flirty. 

So I thought I'd throw out a game of ""Twenty Questions"" for anyone that's also bored and, er, ""flirty"". 

I'll start with the first three. Why blow through everything at once, right?

1. The last person you slept with (or are currently sleeping with) - how long after you first met him did you sleep together? 

2. What's the riskiest and most inappropriate place you've ever gotten busy? 

3. What is something that guys *think* is hot, but really, really isn't?

It's Monday, partly-cloudy, nice outside, and the Twins are in spring training. I'm not a 'bot, in other words. 

Hey, it's just a time-killer...

I am looking for a penpal (strictly penpal) to talk about my most intimate thoughts (and yours)... and by intimate, I do mean that I want to talk about sex but other things too, such as finances, arguments with my wife, etc. You know, the stuff that you usually don't discuss with anyone else. 

My idea is that we can remain anonymous because in talking to a complete stranger... we are more likely to be honest. No expectations, no judgement. I don't plan on exchanging names or photos... you can live near me or be from anywhere else.

I'm college-educated and beyond and I would prefer that you be intelligent, if not college-educated and beyond. I can write nice, detailed letters and conversations.... and I'd like for you to be able to do the same. I don't really care about age, as long as you can express yourself and think about what I am saying and give me a different perspective...

I am seeking platonic Female friends. I am not looking for ANYTHING else. I'm also not interested in an on-line ONLY relationship. If that's what you want, you can stop reading.

I do not text, nor do I like talking on the phone for more than a minute or two. I usually make arrangements to meet someone, or see if they are around, so I can stop by, but that's it. If these too are not for you, then stop reading.

I'm very picky about whom I spend time with. Many behaviors and things people do, are not things that I condone, or tolerate. I don't care if you do some of those things, but I will not hang out with you if you do them while I am around.

I will not answer ANY questions via email, so don't bother asking. I want active, real world friends. If you meet me, you can ask me then. Also, please use complete sentences when you email me. Otherwise, I will have NO IDEA what you are talking about, and will tire of it very quickly.

Для вас, где бы вы ни находились.

Несмотря на то, что мы друг от друга и никогда не встречались, те веры говорят, что в этом мире пространства и времени, мы уже вместе, но просто не могу видеть его еще. Таким образом, чтобы облегчить боль неумолимое время, я пишу это письмо в надежде, что это как-то оформить вашу душу к моим.

Правда быть известно, я искал тебя и до сих пор во всем мире. На улицах, в моих мечтах ... и в глазах каждой души я встречаюсь.

Я потратил на этот раз отдельно от вас в одиночку, устанавливая цели, реализации мечты и стать человеком, которого я всегда хотел быть. У меня было много поездок в течение моей жизни, те, которые я буду делиться с вами. Когда-нибудь я буду также узнать о том, что вы пережили в своем собственном пути, ища меня тоже.

Там было много, кто спросил меня, кто вы и что вы стоите. Мой ответ на них всегда было то же самое, что женщина, которую я люблю знает свою ценность и любит меня больше. Она имеет глубину в ее сердце больше, чем бесконечность.

Они говорят, что лучший успех, что один приходит после того, как их самых больших разочарований. Так что здесь я не буду, не привыкать к разочарованиям жизни или очень глубокие шрамы любви, но все-таки я готов сделать путешествие, чтобы найти свою любовь и простое счастье.

Самое замечательное из всех вещей в жизни, я считаю, это открытие другого человека, с которым наши отношения имеет реальную глубину, красоту и радость как годы растет. Любовь между двумя людьми является наиболее чудесная вещь. Своего рода Божественной аварии.

Можно сказать, что я нахожусь здесь, ожидая, чтобы найти. Для того, чтобы увидеть, может ли я найти ваше сердце. Я хочу, чтобы кто-то говорить и кого-то, чтобы слушать. Я хочу, чтобы домашняя жизнь больше, чем трудовой жизни. Я хочу, чтобы комфорт рутины и острые ощущения от неожиданного. Я хочу, чтобы страсть, доверие, верность и прощение за ошибки. Я неудержим в одиночку, но вы совершите меня, и вместе мы сможем достичь невообразимых высот.

Это время в моей жизни, когда все прощено и все будет отрабатывать. Я потерял, но в большей степени я был благословлен, все, что делает меня, кто я сегодня.

Мысль о том, в одиночку пугает больше всего. Мы пытаемся найти тот, который мы привлечь к на внешний вид, когда мы должны показывать наши сердца, а также - но вы будете видеть меня, и вы найдете меня. Я буду стоять перед вами с открытым сердцем, который вы будете заполнить больше с счастья, мира и любви.

Так что пока мы не встретимся, знают, что я здесь ... терпеливо ждет

Hi my name is Sylvia
Looking for a fun and outgoing female, strictly platonic that's not!!!! Judgmental about a person's 
age!!!! It's hard to meet people around my age and people have seem my ad here before and will 
Email a few times then stop so sad, I still believe that at least there is 1 honest and sincere person 
that is in the same situation that I am in, and feel lonely and would like to have a female friend to talk
too, I have a Great!! Guy in my life and we have fun together, but still we both like to do our own 
Things and he has his friends and I'm happy that he does but now that the weather is getting 
Warmer theirs more I can do with other people garage sales, thrift stores, walking and having 
a good conversation with another female would be wonderful to me. I pray to God everyday to give 
Me strength if it's his will for me to have a friend or not this will be my final try at this 
and if I don't met anyone then I leave it up to him my lord Amen

Hey there. 29 year old single white guy here. I feel like I am smart, funny, caring, and fun loving and hope you are too. I have just been missing that physical touch of another person and I am desperately craving it. I am not looking for sex but if one thing leads to another, I am not opposed to things going further. I am really just looking for someone to cuddle and snuggle with and maybe watch a movie or just kick back, relax, and chat. Nothing super serious. I am a bigger guy (all the better for cuddling if you ask me) and I smoke cigarettes so if that's not your thing please move along. I am open to age, race, body shape, and marital status, however if you are married or attached in some way, please know I do not want to be a part of any drama that you may have. I am drama, disease, and drug free. So, if you please, be the same. If you are 420 friendly that is okay, just know that it's not really my thing.

Answers to some FAQ's:
Can you host? - Sadly, no I cannot. So you must host.
Are you real? - Yep, I sure am. Today is Easter and it's grey and gloomy outside.
Do you have a pic? - Again, yes I do and you will get one if I get one first. Sorry.

So if any of this sounds like fun or you are feeling that missing connection as well, please, hit me up with a reply. As you may have noticed I am quite literate, so please at least make an effort to look like you have an education (I am not trying to sound condescending, just too many people using text speak for whatever reason). Change the subject line in your reply to something witty or funny to catch my attention and prove you aren't spam.

Looking for someone to text or talk to over the phone, maybe meet once or more if we tolerate each other, which I hope we will. Don't just send a message saying hi or asking if I have a pic. Here are the answers to that and other FAQs:

Do you have a pic? Yes
Pic for pic? Sure, my inbox awaits you eagerly
Will you sell me your panties? No
What do you do for fun? Really, if I tell you now you won't remember BUT if you insist: travel, garden, cook, camping, listen to music, bike, lay on a hammock, dream of moving away from artic winter temperatures.
Are you real? Yup, and it's Easter and gloomy outside.

You: not a putz, single (not married in other words), 25-43 don't just want to talk about sex.

Me: sometimes a putz, brunette, employed, long list of things I consider fun and lame. Sometimes I do lame things for fun and that's a whole other conversation. Proximity is important to me. I don't even know where Coon Rapids and Plymouth are. Yup, I'm that girl.

I was tired of my spouse, we'd been together too long
Like a worn-out recording of a favorite song
So while they lay there sleeping, I read the paper in bed

""If you like Pina Coladas and getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga, if you have half-a-brain
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape
I'm the love that you've looked for, write to me and escape""

THAT is corny, but you get the picture!

Have you been married for a very long time and find yourself wondering what it would be like to have an intimate relationship with a long-time married friend? Obviously we would be discreet about our new-found friendship and keep our contact between the two of us. I'm wondering, too, so here is my ""escape ad"".

I'm a single mom of one school-age kid. Have a boyfriend I should really dump. Have a great job and a really cool cat. I am overall mostly content but I don't have any single parent friends. I have childless friends and partnered/married friends who have a second body to watch the kid(s) sometimes, and therefore do not understand the plight of the single parent. I'm no longer interested in explaining myself to them or worrying if So and So is going to be mad that I can't go do something every week. I'm over that. So, here I am, wondering if any single moms of school age kids (mine is 9) are in the same boat! 

I like to do a lot of things that we can chat about if you write me. I'm kind of nerdy, non religious, and egalitarian. I've gained a little chub this winter so I'm planning to be a little more active and lay off my beloved wine for a while (pretty sure the chub is 94% the wine's fault, sadly). A lot more can be said so feel free to reach out. 

PS if you have or had a significant other who couldn't stand the kids, definitely write me.

Yes, That's correct. I am many things, but can't seem to beat that. If you want to know what makes me a pariah, you'll have to email me. It'll surely be the only one I get from you.

I am not like the others, and belonging is a myth. I used to think that I belonged somewhere, but time has not shown that to be the case. Now I haven't BEEEEEN EVVVERYWWHERE, so I may not have found where MY others are, but for me, life's been the opposite of belonging. Right from birth.

What makes me so unwanted? The reality is that I know good and well what those things are, but I AM NOT like that, and that's the Elephant in the room. People will claim all day long that they're accepting... AHHEMM... BULLSHIT! 

STAY

JUDGMENTAL

AND

KEEP

XENOPHOBIC

Growing up, I made friends easily. Time and circumstance, however, have made meeting new people something rare. I hang out on the weekends with a married couple that I've known for years, see others on occasion, and do all the activities and projects I REALLY enjoy, by my self.

I can NOT for the LIFE of me figure out who's arm I need to twist to get a companion for those activities. Someone with my level of interest and ability in those things. I hope we get AI Humanoids soon. Hey Chappie, LET'S GO!

Before you go and send me suggestions, I'm not interested in hearing it, Ok?

I want an ongoing outdoor activity partner. Hiking, Bicycling, in-line Skate, Disc golf, Spelunking, Snowshoeing, Canoeing, Backpacking, camping...

Being a pariah is what prevents this, so I'll just keep doing these things alone.

Seeking a classy, fun, in-shape, HWP, intelligent friend. Looking for fun and flirty email exchanges to bring a smile and laughter into each day. Prefer someone with a positive and playful attitude. If we hit it off and it leads to having coffee or a glass of wine down the road, so be it. I'm not opposed.

You'll find me to be an intelligent, professional, well-dressed man that is willing to discuss a variety of subjects. I am currently partnered, but don't let that deter you from responding. It means that I'm not married and not dating multiple people. Perhaps you are partnered too. 

Looking for one female friend to connect with and establish a ""Flirtationship"" that may or may not lead to something more. No hurry, no rush, no expectations.

It's going to be rainy and cooler later this week, so a great opportunity to exchange a few emails and get to know one another.

I am not looking for a hook up or FWB, as that is not where I am currently at in my life. Married or single is fine, you are relatively free during the day during the week, you live in the northern burbs, Crystal, Brooklyn Park, Maple Grove, Anoka, etc. I would like someone 30 or older, so we have more in common.

Hi there. Thanks for reading my ad, out of the probably thousands of these that are out there. 

In short, I'm looking for someone to chat with on a regular basis. I get somewhat bored at work from time to time, and today is one of those times. Not really interested in chatting with a ton of people, or talking for an hour or two then being done. I guess I'm looking for more of a pen pal kinda thing. Let's get to know each other, vent about our lives, and be actual friends (electronically), and chat about anything our hearts desire.

Sound like something you'd be interested in? Then what are you waiting for?! Email me, and type ""I'll talk to you!"" as the subject to weed out the plethora of spam emails that I will most certainly get. Also, pick our first topic of conversation. The most interesting ones will probably yield a quicker respond.

It's gonna be close to 70 today. Any plans for the nice weather?

Hello!

I'm a 30 year old married woman with no kids who is looking for someone to hang out with from time to time. I'm into thrift shopping, going for walks, having coffee, or just hanging out at home and watching movies or netflix to pass the time. I like to go out to dive bars occasionally and play the jukebox or shake dice, whatever seems entertaining! 

I'm really laid back with a good sense of humor and I'm hoping to find some cool ladies who dont need a huge game plan to arrange a get together and are cool just hanging out and chatting. Please be within 15 minutes of the Lindstrom area because I want to be able to stop by without having to make huge arrangements (again, just chill :D) so in the Shafer, Taylors Falls, St. Croix Falls, Osceola, Forest Lake, Chisago or Center City area would be excellent.

I can't be the only person bored as hell in the area. Drop me a line and let's see if we connect!

I love food and baking, reading, movies and just started knitting. No drugs, period and I'm not ok with you if you do them so don't bother. I don't drink but don't care if you do if you aren't sloppy about it. I'm absolutely not looking for someone I have clean up and take care of (I will leave you if you become ridiculous). I'm also not a fan of smoking, sorry.

Hello gentlemen-

I am searching for an email friend and on a lark I've turned to craigslist! 

I'm looking for an email friend who is kind, thoughtful, a little flirty, funny, intelligent and consistent. Also someone who is able to string several sentences together to make a paragraph and who is able to keep the conversation going. Oh, and single. That one is important. 

I'm not too picky about the topics of our conversations. Tell me about your job and what you like or dislike. Vent about your crazy roommate. Tell me your secrets. Tell me funny stories about your dog! Pretend you're a dog! No, wait. Not that...that would be weird. 

I really must ask you not to send inappropriate photos and/or emails. I am ONLY looking for an email friend. Strictly platonic, ya dig? And truthfully, I'll probably just mock you if you send me naughty material anyway annnnnd possibly show it to my girlfriends. And I don't want to make you sad by doing that. :)

I feel that this is something that is either only in porn or more rare than anything all together! Can or do REAL women REALLY deep throat? I mean like take the entire thing in their mouth. 
Is there such thing? I know this is more or less a rhetorical question, but I mean how can there be so few?
I believe a lot of women say they can, but truly can't fully DT!!
Is it an age thing? The older you get the more experienced? or the younger have less Gag reflex? I think this is BS!
Please put your favorite eye color in the subject. I do have gtalk/hangouts if you want to try that too.

Very few people (if any) know you're like this. If they were going to to try and guess which of their friends might be looking around - you'd probably be the last person they'd look to. Maybe you've always been this way or maybe it's something that is new, but you have a need that is not being filled.

Hi Craigslist,

I need some serious help for I am having internal battles about my current relationship.

My wife and I are recovering from a major relationship issue from the past when she decided to have sexual relations with other men. I want to say I'm over it, but deep down inside, I feel like I'm really not. I feel like we're in a good spot today, but I know there's still some things she's not telling me because she KNOWS it'll hurt me if she shares that information. I supposedly already know a lot she tells me, like 80-90%. This secret though, this area of unknown, the final 10-20%, it pains me sooooo much though, and she tells me some things are better left unknown. I want to believe her, I want to trust her, I want to give her my 100% but what she's asking for is a HUGE ask I feel and I don't know if I can do it. 

I just don't know if i will ever truly get over it if I don't get her 100% of the story, if I don't hear it straight from her, I feel like I will have reservations for her no matter how hard I try to love her again. I feel like it'll loom over my shoulders forever otherwise, but I only time will tell?

My question is, I guess, should I really just let it go? If so, how the hell do I even do that? Or, how do I make her tell me the full story? Maybe it's truly better if I don't know, because maybe it'll truly crush me? At this point though, I don't really care and just want to know!

After her most recent share about what she's done in the past which was a couple nights ago, I've been having nasty images of her and another man on replay in my head all day and it just makes my heart drop. Am I in the wrong to be feeling this way? Is what I'm feeling justified? I mean, she's here with me now, she did choose to stay with me, but why do I still feel this way? I still feel like something is still missing and I don't quite understand what it is. There's just so much going on I'm not sure what to think of it. I love my wife and I think she's beautiful, but I think I may be reaching a threshold I previously wasn't aware of?

Anyway, if you've read this far already, please provide some insight to your thoughts about my perception of my relationship. I really need some help and can't carry this alone. Lugging these thoughts around all day to-and-fro work, home, and everywhere else has been extremely taxing. 

If you're wondering, I've shared how I've felt with my wife, but she dismisses my points and can't empathize with me. She's closed that chapter in her life and has moved on, I want to do the same, but for me, it's so much harder and I can't understand why. She feels just in her decision-making then and doesn't feel remorseful for how she made me feel and hates the thought of apologizing or even feeling the slightest bit empathetic. I guess for her, she says, she was all ready to leave when she performed all those acts, therefore, her heart was elsewhere, and therefore her body too. I'm like, FML....

Anyway, that's enough. I can write a novel if I wanted to. 

So if you've been in a similar situation or have a deeper understanding of the greater issue at play, your response will be very much appreciated. 

Thanks you Craiglist.

Hi there. I'm a 25 year old veterinary student and I work in an animal hospital. I love to laugh, learn new things, watch/go to movies, shop, go to the gun range, try new foods and play all sorts of games. 

As for the title, I'm recently divorced and 22 weeks pregnant, so I'm still trying to get used to not being married and also becoming a mom. I'm completely open to making friends with ladies that may or may not be moms; I just need an excuse to get out of the house and keep my mind occupied during downtime with chatting. I've only had a few close female friends in my life and I'd like to change that as I enter this new phase in my life.

I thought this 'Strictly Platonic' section is a great place to make local friends, of course, like minded, easy going, fun loving people. But......

I have posted on here before and have gotten responses who seem genuinely interested, but always fall out when it comes to the next step of meeting. Not sure if they chicken out or get intimidated or just plain wasting time since they may have free time!! Ok.. I will stop ranting.

It seems like its difficult to make new friends in the Midwest especially when have their own circle of friends and doesn't want to expand the horizon.

Its actually sad that I have met several people across the ocean and other countries and keep in touch regularly and visit, but its hard to make friends locally!

I've not yet given up hope of finding new friends, but this is not about that. This is about us being strangers. It may sound weird, but I think it could work out... maybe.

Here's what I'm thinking: We never ask, or divulge, personal things about each other. We arrange the activities, and where to meet (inside the Minneapolis City limits) via email. We can leave the City limits, but we must START inside them. We ONLY talk about the activity that we are doing, or things that are happening to us in the present, and other non-personal things. That life doesn't exist when we are together. We leave that all out. A clean white board to fill, for just us.

Does this sound like something that could be managed? It might be a struggle at first, to keep from normal get acquainted banter, but I want us to remain complete strangers.

I'll refer to you as you'd like, and you refer to me as I choose.

What do you say?... Stranger?

I'm a guy from out-of-state who is a terrible fit with Minnesota people most of the time. I would like to meet some female friends who have moved to the Twin Cities from other states and countries.

Hey everyone, 

Thank you for looking. I've never done this type of thing before but here it goes.

I'm 25 Female, living out of the Minneapolis area. I am seeking a friend, BD to help me out in times of need. 
I'm very outgoing, friendly, happy, adventurous. If at all possible, I am not very open to intimacy and in a email I can explain. I'm open to many other things although.

I can send a photo with the first email, I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

I keep thinking that I can make new friends using the internet, and more specifically craigslist. That's why I am delusional. I may be insane too, because to do the same thing over and over, while getting the same result, and thinking that the result will be different, is one definition if insanity.

I'm not too picky. I'm not unlikeable. I'm not dangerous. I'm not an imbecile. I''m just different from the rest. Too different apparently.

I just wanted people to do things with, that was all.

Being delusional, I'll probably try again in the future, when the anguish of this recent series of attempts wears off. I have hope, and that's eternal. Even craigslist can't crush THAT.

Good Day!

I find myself being able to talk to pretty much anyone. I recently met a nice young guy here, but turns out he just is not that into really wanting to be friends, even though we seem to have formed such a strong bond. I am looking for the again, but a genuine and true bond.

I am just looking for one great text friendship. I would eventually be open to meeting if we really hit it off. Please don't be a serial Craigslist guy, who posts 4 ads in hopes of finding someone better, especially if we get a long so great lol 

I am open to all races and ages, just be prepared to chat a lot and have fun. I am 27 years of age, I enjoy deep conversations, both pointless and meaningful. I like watching thought provoking shows and a wide range of cartoons and anime. I am pretty shy in person at first, but let the brightness of my heart out if I care for you. I can at times be emotional, but lol really start girl isn't. 

Thank you for reading! 
I really do look forward to our text conversations :)

You love fitting words together, shaping them into images. So do I. 

Between us, we could weld grand thunderstorms of longing, hear the screech of bending iron, feel the friction of thought paired with thought. We could spit words out at one another like marbles, send them rolling through blood vessels, through heart valves, through cranial nerves, through windpipes that sigh in the dead of night while the sweating moon looks in the window. 

We may play. We may fuck or be tender or hate each other's guts. Indeed, we may never meet, but we'll pack sentences together like careful origami and send them to one another through the magic of internet. Let's make our hearts pound through an imperfect love of an imperfect language. Let's suspend disbelief. We'll make words the currency of our own reality and leave the rest of the world behind. 

Write to me. Let's see what happens.

I will remove this post when I have a guest join me. This spare ticket is not for sale! I won these and this is an invitation to join me for a fun night and to celebrate my birthday,

Do you love music? Are you a fan of KS95? I won tickets to the next Live95 concert! It's on Thursday April 7th. I'm looking for an outgoing guy to join me at this event. It's also my birthday on the 7th as well. Doors open at 6:30 so I was thinking it would be nice to meet before hand and get to know each other. Also possibly have a light dinner as well. I'm a SWF and HWP...You are a SWM or mixed, between the ages of 27-50, a non smoker and DDF. You should be at least HWP . Hopefully you dance some to...I love to dance even though I'm not very good. LOL... I'm DDF and a non smoker. (Not that that part matters as this is being posted in platonic). You should be available to stay till the end of the concert, otherwise what's the point of going?

I have two tickets to the Florence and the Machine concert in June with Grimes opening, and I'm looking for someone to show me around the city before the show in exchange for one of the tickets. I'd like to check out the Walker sometime in the afternoon, maybe walk up to Mill Ruins Park, share dinner and attend the show together if we hit it off, but with no prior obligations outside of serving as a tour guide. About me. I'm an artist and a lover of nature. I work as a tree health care specialist, but my passion is painting. Artistically, I'm into pinup, tattoo flash, surreal landscapes, poster art and cosplay (not an experienced cosplayer but definitely open minded to learning from one). I'm in my thirties and prefer younger women, twenty something at least, but age doesn't matter to me if it doesn't to you. Appearances aren't terribly important as I am primarily looking for a friend, but am single and available for more if the chemistry is right, so it would work best if we find each other attractive. It would be awesome to meet someone fun to attend shows with when I'm in the city. My last five events were Suicide Girls Blackheart Burlesque, Alt J, Mumford & Sons, The Flaming Lips and The Black Keys. Your pic gets mine.

Hi~! It is about 3:40pm, I am in EP and done with work for the day. I am headed to have a drink at a nice place nearby. I am funny (truly- I am told I am a ""hoot"" to be around), fit (like actually workout), attractive, safe, single and fun. So- if you are in a similar boat come have a drink with me. Platonic is good but if you are searching a bed mate or a marriage maybe bring that up first thing :)

Hello, 

Thanks for stopping by to read my ad. I hope I'm interesting enough that you reply if you like what you hear. 

I'm 37 year old married man (judge if you like but you only live once). I think I'm a pretty awesome guy in general. 

I'm open to finding a variety of relationships. Someone new to chat with during the day would be great. Cool with not planning on meeting if that is not your cup of tea. If after some talking you want to exchange pics no prob. If you do want to meet at sometime I can probably do that as well. Sorta open to seeing what the universe brings. 

Contact me back via cl but please give me some indication you are real. Like say something about the ad or day of the week. 

Hope to hear back from you soon.

I just wanted to take this opportunity to apologize to women for my past behavior. I have always been a man who felt he had to seduce many women to prove he was a man. I have used many women in my 48 years.

However, recently I met a strong woman. A woman who enjoys putting a man in his true place. She made me realize that what I did in the past, I did to overcome my short own comings. She has made me realize than men truly are sissies. Women are the stronger species. Women should be the ones in charge of a relationship. I am male a sissy that is in a female led relationship. I have been branded as a sissy. Forced to get a piercing to show I am a sissy for her. I am also forced to only wear women's lingerie all the time. Other things as well

I was told that I need to apologize to all the women I hurt or used in the past. So ladies, if I hurt you by sleeping with you and not calling you back, I am sorry. I truly mean that. I am realizing how pathetic I was and am as a man. So please accept my apologies.

I truly apologize to all of you.

If you know who I am or if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

But, for today, I am super bored and just reading through this Craigslist (some of you that post especially on Missed Connections - HILARIOUS) and wondering what goes in the minds of people when they see are bored or aimlessly walking around the skyway. Would you meet somone on here, Would you go out with him/her, would you make out with him/her, would you become friends, would you introduce him/her to your friends/spouse, do you think naughty, flirty!!

So, this is a kind of somewhere between platonic and casual encounters, but I figured I would start here (based on the other ads in the platonic section, its not too far off). 

Essentially, I am a 30 year old single guy, but I am lacking male friends. I am currently under employed but, I am looking for work. I have always made excuses, but I think part of the reason I have always felt slightly uncomfortable with male friends is because I am very closeted bi guy. I am a shy guy in general, and I have never been out on a date or let alone had any type of relationship. Somehow I feel more comfortable with men than women. But I however am not interested in anything sexual or dating, but a bromance is something I've wanted for a while.

I am 5'9"" give or take, and some body, but trimmed face. Short brown hair and hazel eyes. Anyone close in age under 40 is fine. And just be interesting, fun, the prancing type and patient. I have a wide variety of interests. I think we need to really build some trust for something like this to work, so be willing to do that. I am not looking for right now, just someone I can chat with and hang out with.

So I got back into gaming earlier this year and my Steam friend list is looking pretty barren. Searching for someone to play with and just shoot the breeze in general. I have loads of games (I can't say no to sale) and a pretty broad taste as well, though I prefer RPGs and indie games.

Should make it pretty clear that I'm not from anywhere nearby so this isn't a subtle ploy to hook up or any other creepy shit. I don't care if you're married or partnered or whatever, I just want some gaming buddies. 

S'pose it's customary to put a little about me here: I'm 33 and single. Gainfully employed. Open minded, good sense of humor. Obviously enjoy gaming a great deal, and other activities that involve sitting down. Reading, watching movies, listening to music. We can exchange emails (or Kik) a bit as well if you prefer. The internet is a weird place and I'm sure you'd like to confirm I'm Mostly Harmless and not gonna bombard you with pictures of my dick in a little top hat or something. Though you might get a lot of pictures of my cat. He's a silly sailor. But anyway, if any of this strikes you feel free to drop me a line.

TL;DR - Looking for Steam friends.

This post is just for a lark really. Think what you like about it, or not.

I think everyone is crazy. If you look closely, dig deep, watch long enough, you could pick out some THING that makes you feel some type of way. If you WERE... fully conformist?... I'd be SHOCKED. I certainly hope you aren't, 'cause I'm not. I want to hear about your non-conformity. NO... REALLY.

Unfortunately, I'm not like anyone else that I can find. I can't seem to get the peg in the hole. (not innuendo) That's a subject I want to keep away from. With you anyway. (platonic section)

The goal was new friends. That's what this functions as, right? Maybe I have it all wrong and this is just some version of a chat room. People just looking to yackity-yak (don't talk back) via text, and nothing more, 'cause it seems that way, just sayin'.

I thought, and still think, that it's a community board to post offers and offerings, for others to come to a central location and peruse through, to acquire aforementioned things. Am I wrong?

Since I haven't been conveying a proper message, in the correct way, to appeal to someone who'd like a companion for mutually enjoyable things, I'll put out, since it's a fairly simple thing to request, that you take a walk with me. It can be short, long, or really long. It's up to you. If you want you can ask me a shitload of questions before we walk anywhere. Like a speed date. You should make a card with them on it, for brevity. There are few I won't answer, and Some will certainly be replied to with some of my own.

The point is to meet and talk, so if you want questions answered, you can ask my face. Want to see it, send yours first. I don't care, but everyone else seems to, and since I'm attempting to be that way for the sake of compromise, I'll reciprocate. My post, you go first. Don't get bent out of shape if I'm not flash with the picture. I can't stand that anger and dismissal thing. Settle down, take a minute, and BREATHE!

I've got one hand in my pocket, and the other one is waving a good bye.

Hey guys, I've posted here a couple of times looking for someone that wants to be my workout buddy or just a friend in general. I don't care what your gender is. Sadly the people I've met with didn't stick around long, for some reason my post gets flagged for deletion too. I want to make it very clear I'm just looking for someone to work out with me, or if you're not into working out just hanging out and becoming friends.Walking, the gym, I have a membership at planet fitness. If I found someone that had a membership there or would like to just go there with me would be great but that's not the only option, walking and stuff like that are possible too.

I'm a bit of a bigger girl, I'm very upset I'm back to the point I started at. I need someone that can help motivate me, keep me going, not give up on myself. I work better with other people and I need the kick in the butt. If you're interested please send me an email and we can talk. I don't meet many people and that's why I post here, a little sad I know but it's led to some great friendships.


To make it clear, I just want someone to workout with me, nothing sexual or anything like that. Workout buddy, friends. I hope to hear from you, thanks for your time, I hope to hear from you.

Hello!

Note: I posted this in this section on purpose. I'm not looking for a one night stand or a long term relationship. I'm just looking to help someone more as a friend.

I'm also not trying to hurt anyone's feelings -- quite the contrary. I'm trying to help. If you read to the bottom, you'll see that I give the other side of this coin too. ;-)

Thanks for reading. I'll cut right to the chase. Most women don't know how to give oral sex to a man. And that is understandable. It isn't a trait you are born with, it is something you need to learn. Given the sensitive nature of the topic and that it is something that needs to be learned by doing and two way communication, it is no wonder that most women don't know how to do this properly (even many who think they do).

I am also going to be completely up front here. Almost all men really want a woman who can do this one thing well. They may not say so (may not want to hurt your feelings), may seek out another woman or leave the relationship, all because of this one thing. I know that sounds rough, but it is the truth.

If you are a good catch in most other ways and give good oral sex often, most men (unless they are idiots) will know they have a good thing and will stay in the relationship.

So, why am I posting this? I am offering to help you learn how to give great oral sex. This applies to you if...

You are

inexperienced and are worried that you will get in this situation and not know what to do and be embarrassed.

have avoided/refused to give oral sex because you don't know what to do and are too embarrassed to tell the man.

have given oral sex and the man complained about your technique, but didn't work together to improve it.

have given oral sex and the man left the relationship or cheated on you.

have given oral sex and you think you know what you are doing, but have some doubts in the back of your head and would like to know for sure.

have given oral sex and think you know what you are doing, but wonder about other techniques so that you can offer variety to a man.

It is rare for a woman to not fall into one or more of these categories, so don't feel bad. You have these choices

Do nothing. Doing nothing to solve a problem is never a good choice, no matter the problem.

Get in a relationship with a man and tell him that you need help and hope that he is able and willing to have this discussion and help you. Risk embarrassment and/or him being a jerk, or embarrassed himself, and him leaving. You may find a man who is understanding and who will be truly honest. You may also end up in a situation where he doesn't want to hurt your feelings or doesn't want to or know how to help you, so he just tells you that you are doing great. You then continue doing what you are doing, he is not satisfied, and if/when you end up in another relationship, you keep doing what you thought was good, but is not, and that man isn't satisfied either. He may just think you are beyond help and not want to bring up the subject. Remember, men can be embarrassed to bring this up too.

Read books/magazines/online articles. You may learn some tips here, but it is a far cry from real, hands on (literally) experience, and instant feedback. In fact, you may have already tried this approach. How is that working for you?

Take me up on my offer to help. I am not going to make fun of you. I am not going to lie to you. I am not going to run away. And even if you are worried about these things, I don't really matter, since I am not the one you want to hold onto. You aren't risking a real relationship here.

What I will do is be very open and honest, understanding, clearly communicate, and provide a happy and positive learning experience for you. I can guarantee you will learn how to give great oral sex, feel confident and good about yourself when doing so, and not have these doubts hanging over your head. Romantic relationships are complex and there are many reasons they fail, but this won't be the reason for you and may just be one reason a relationship succeeds for you.

You really have nothing to lose by replying to me. I understand that it might be awkward and you don't know what to say. I'll make it easy on you. You can just reply and say that you are interested in my help. I'll take it from there. No stress. :-) I'm laid back, non-judgmental and easy to talk to.

No, that isn't me in the picture. ;-) Feel free to ask anything else you'd like to know.

Oh, and although this has all been about oral sex, if you have doubts about other things and you want help with those, that's fine too. I focussed on oral sex, because it is the one thing that causes the most problems for women. That doesn't mean it is the only area you can learn and improve upon.

As I stated up front, my intention is not to make anyone feel badly. However, I am being very honest and very direct. This is just the reality of this aspect of human sexuality. If you feel badly, then I encourage you to do something about it.

I'll add something else as well. I am by no means claiming that women don't know how to do this, but men know how to give oral sex wonderfully. I'm well aware that most men get a failing grade in this subject. In fact, if I had to guess, I'd say that men, on average, do far worse. I believe women are more complex down there than men, so men have an even steeper learning curve. Women are also more varied than men in what they need to reach climax. I'm not saying women have it easy or that it is easy to know what to do with a man (hence this post). I'm just saying you might have it a little easiER than men. So feel good about that!

I'm in no position to help men. However, I can also help you in how to approach this subject with men and how to help them become better at providing you with what you need as well.

Now take the thirty seconds to hit reply and send me a message! I'm a nice guy, I promise. :-)

HI Ladies
A little bit about myself, I am outgoing and love being outdoors especially now that the weather is getting better...well maybe in the next few weeks the weather will be good. Nway, I am looking for a friend who likes being adventurers and doing fun activities. I really would like a friend I can count on and one who is not flaky. I am very loyal and would like the same in a friend. 
If you are looking for an awesome friend, shoot me an email and I will get back to you.

Hello there,
I should post as a disclaimer that I am married and 18 weeks pregnant, yikes-now that that's out of the way you see my dilemma. I am the first and only of my friends to adopt this lifestyle which tends to leave a 'lost in translation' with my other friends regarding social event choice.
I am near the end of my bachelors in nursing, waiting on employment until after first baby.
About me: Tattoos, piercings lifestyle, love anything nerdy; especially art, video games and anime (cosplay). Ex-rave go go party girl, love adventure including exploration and physical activities. (Downtown photography, yes please).
Open in life, pansexual, no I won't hit on you but I have a lot of gay friends if that bothers you.

Like to share opinions, ideas and sexual fantasies

You're different and you know it. Not in an arrogant way ... it's just that you can afford to be very selective in your relationships because you are a cut above the rest. 

You are brutally intelligent and well educated. People see you as successful and you have much going for you. You have integrity in the way you live and demonstrate characteristics of loyalty, honesty, openness and compassion. You take your responsibilities seriously. You're fit and very attractive.

Yet, here you are ... looking for something more in life. You are most likely partnered/married and in general very happy with that arrangement. You just need more connection, a bit more adventure in life. You are not needy and so you are not going to enter into a relationship lightly ... as I said ... you can be highly selective ... you're that good. 

I am an educated, loyal, handsome gentleman looking for one person to share a deep friendship with. I'm not interested in serial CL relationships and you should not be either. You want one special friend ... a friend that is not needy and has their emotional life in order. 

This may be very new for you, as life is in general wonderful. Yet, it is now time to explore a bit. You need to seek that mystery and magic that has faded over time.

I'm not looking for a fling ... I'm looking for someone that wants a long term friendship without interfering with their current relationships. I envision us getting together once or twice a month after getting to know each other by email. 

Hope to hear from you!

frustrations in life is exactly that. it's life. I get that. you wouldn't be worried about things in life if you weren't alive but I guess not knowing what's next is a good thing.

I have to change but I don't want to in certain ways but love watching my children change and grow. such is life, not getting everything we want but ignoring the little things that make life truly special. A coworker of mine accepted another job and on her last day,I wanted to give her a hug goodbye. I didn't but gave her a high five. truly pathetic but just plain silly I guess. I guess I either chickened out or over analyzed it. I guess I worried too much of the social norm or maybe that I make things awkward. oh well, til next time. thanks

I have overcome a lot in my life and it has made me a very strong, brave and interesting person. 

I love movies and music. I love going to concerts. I love to cook and dine out as well. I need someone to cook for and to dine with! I like hitting the casinos, roadtrips, Netflix, hiking, massage, yoga and meditation, being in nature. I love animals and zoos, and I'm a dog-lover in particular.

I like anime, video games, reading, writing and art.
I love tattoos and piercings, exploring the city, haunted houses, camping and theme parks.
I love going out, getting coffee and the downtown art scene.
I live a very open and accepting lifestyle, I am pansexual although this won't affect the friendship.
I am finishing up my bachelors in nursing, and really looking to connect with people to either go out and/or sit around and play video games or watch movies/anime.

Big BOOBs play? Treats on me! Seriously why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free? That's what I have always been told. You might as well get some treats for your big teats? Let's talk and come up with something that works for us both.

The bigger the better the tighter the sweater...or something like that. Maybe T-shirt, blouse or something you gravitate towards, besides your tummy, nicely. 

So, you have a splendid rake, a ton of ta tas and every time you go out your get stared at. Has to be a lot to deal with? How do you do it? 

Would you like some attention to you...instead your big melons? Want to talk about life in the big boob lane, the ups and downs so to speak. It's not all a bed of roses, I understand and appreciate that it is a mixed blessing. 

Confession! I am a boob man. You don't say?! And I like nothing better than caring for and adoring nicely in a variety of very nice ways, YOUR BEAUTIFUL BREASTS. Seeing you flush with excitement, swelling with pleasure from my boob obsession is icing on the cake. 

So think about it. You have to hoist your big girls around all the time, your shoulders ache, you have to put up (literally ala Playtex cantilever 24 hour engineering marvels) with a lot. Why not find a regular admirer who is deeply interested in you finding as much pleasure from your big breasts, lovely areolas and nipples and I DO? I might just open a new feeling or two for you.


I am nobody to be afraid of or uncomfortable with. Very normal, WM, post-grad educated, tall, blue eyed, very attractive. Apparently my middle aged chronology (age, 50) is a impediment, but it shouldn't. I am very young looking and if anything it gives me some maturity and measure to make smarter decisions, have some patience and understanding and more appreciation about life and all it has...and could have. That's where you come in. Would you like to throw your hat ( and brassier) into the ring and be my adult playmate....and I, yours? What do you have to lose? Deep shoulder strap marks that need some relief? To see the upside of things you carry and lift ...you know...the cup is half full, way more than half full. But you can't do these things alone, or not nearly as nicely. You know you would really like an honest shoulder rub and foot to go along with your other ...rubs. I promise to do both...and BOTH so very nicely you will want to compensate me somehow, but I do it for bigger reasons. My mission in life is to see and feel you cum and orgasm from my attention and sensitive care and attention to your breasts! The balls in your court dear, send me your bra size and favorite T time activity!

I promise I can do both, nicely. 

Have grand boobies, please. 44DDD or more.

It can be about any subject, and my job will be to listen and offer advice where it is needed. I will then get your feedback about what was helpful and what was not. That's it.

I'd really like a close friend. A best friend. (And a potential life partner, if things went that way).

I can email a lot on the weekends while at work. During the week, I can talk on the phone, run errands, go for walks--you know, day-to-day life.

I have vacation time I can use on some weekends--I've been saving up the time off for the right person to spend it with.

I'm authentic. Down-to-earth. A great communicator. I like to get to the heart of the matter. I like to deal with emotions and explore deeply into relationships, life experiences, and other areas that are meaningful.

I like to laugh, be silly; and I enjoy just being.

I'm a one-best-friend kind of person. I'm big on exclusivity. I want someone authentic and sensitive to share life with.

I'm female. You can be male or female.

It may be a long shot, but I am looking for a friend (any gender or orientation) who'd like to hang out with me and do the boring stuff in life. Don't get me wrong- I'd love to go out and see movies, walks, patio drinks, game nights, etc. too,

Hi Everyone! I'm a wife/mom that is searching for conversation and occasional hanging out. The husband and I have a great relationship but we work opposite schedules so our time together is very limited. Not looking to cheat so if you want more than that, I'm not your girl. 

Ideal scenario = one man that is comfortable with my relationship status, close to my age and local to text throughout the day and meet up with. This could include happy hour, dinner, dancing, movies, sporting events, comedy clubs, concerts, etc. 

Interested? Hit me up so we can start chatting asap!

This is a topic I've been having difficulties finding people who know anything about it. Weeks ago one of my lovers told me that he had HPV, so I got tested and I have it as well, so I told the three others and have stopped having sex. I've given blow jobs since then, but having gone from multiple lovers to none it's been rather difficult for me :-b.

So, was wondering if someone reading this has HPV as well and could answer some questions into how you handled it. Thankfully I have the non-cancerous strain, so that's awesome. The only 'cure' is time. It'll be really hard, but it can be as little as 6 months for it to go away, but as much as a year and my doctor doesn't seem to think it's a big deal. Just wondering if you just cut out sex in your life? Or did you continue, just making sure condoms were used? Just curious what changes you've done? I know it seems weird to post, but I am afraid I will give in to my urges, especially if after six months it's not gone as I go crazy usually after a couple weeks.

Thank you in advance for the real responses to my inquiry

I'm currently single, but I'm not on here looking for someone to date necessarily. I don't care what you look like. What I am looking for is someone who shares similar interests, wants hang out occasionally, and text or chat. Lately I've been watching a lot of Minnesota Wild hockey since we are on the verge of clinching a playoff spot, and I also play hockey in a local league. Since it's getting warmer every day I'd like to spend more time outside either going for walks, bike rides, etc. I enjoy brewing my own beer outside in the summer so I'm looking forward to that too. Of course I have other interests like movies, music, restaurants, coffee, blah, blah, blah. Message me if you are in the same boat, and I'll disseminate more about myself!! We could trade pic for pic if that's your thing.

Why do you bother to read craigslist posts? You're not going to reply to them. You're not going to meet anyone. If you do send a reply, it's only to ask the same stupid questions everyone else does, or ask for a picture, because you're superficial and shallow. How can you stand out if you are JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE? If I were superficial, you'd never meet MY standards. I used to have a stupid list of criteria, but don't any longer.

Hey, married guy here, just looking for a married woman who wants to chat during the days on kik. I'm typically home alone during the afternoon due to a job that gets me up early and I get bored. Never looking to leave my situation or meet up, just want a fun woman who likes to flirt, chat and get to know all sides of each other. Home all day today...alone.

Send me your kik username in the subject line...I can also do yahoo or snapchat if you prefer.

Seeking female friends with similar interests for possible new female friendships. I am a 52 y/o white female who is very nice, down to earth, fun, ""normal"" lol, has varied interests (including movies, cooking, crafting, walking, shopping, lunching, wine get-togethers, love animals, music etc), sense of humor. For some unknown reason I find myself a bit lacking in friendships/fun female companionship. This is STRICTLY PLATONIC. If you find yourself in the same boat send me a few words about yourself (:
Btw I am happily married, have older kids. Please have a similar life situation as I do in regards to age, etc. Chances are we'll have more in common.

Hi! I'm john. I suppose I should tell you a bit about myself. I'm 26. I'm a bit chubby but not huge, six foot nothing, nerdy, intelligent, Netflix addict, open minded, white, nonjudgmental, bearded, and I'm just looking to get to know someone and have some fun with. I'm also a sucker for curvy women, so BBW is a big yes. I love to read, go to movies, lift weights, hike, and cuddle. I'm open to more if we really hit it off, but for now I'd like to just have someone to chat with about anything and everything. Im open to talking openly about sexual things, swapping pic, and more. I'm very easy going and chill kind of guy, and I'm pretty much a night owl. I'd be open to hanging out once we chat a bit, but it's not required. I'd like to get to know some awesome people. It would be great to hear back from you. :)

Firstly i am curious as to why there is a man seeking woman section under strictly platonic, and on second thought it occurs to me just how anguished Plato must have felt about friendships with the opposite sex. However I have chosen to post in this section with the hope of meeting a kindred spirit.

I suppose I'd define myself as an empty nester without a nest. I may be in denial and just be another lonely old man. Regardless, I feel the need for friendship and think that I would make a good one. I am willing to be emotionally available and cherish our time.

So, I'm not a complainer, by any means. I was just thinking how difficult it can be for a guy on this site to find what he's looking for, thinking, how great would it be to be a woman on here... choosing from a list of hundreds of male suitors. 

But then I decided to walk in ""your shoes"". Sifting through the m4w section, particularly casual encounters, is a complete joke. It honestly makes me embarrassed to be part of the male species. It's clear you don't have an easy time on here either, you definitely have quantity, just zero quality. 

Let's break down a types of ads I noticed:

Ad title= ""yo wanna hook up 2night call me now horny"" 

Really? I'd like some enlightenment from you women... Does this work?? My intuition says no, but if so many guys are placing ads like this it must be successful at least occasionally. We're talking about a guy here who has worse grammar skills than a 1st grader. Do these people have jobs? How did he even turn on his computer? So many questions... 

Ad title= ""horny need pussy asap""

As a man, I'm sure we've all had this feeling at some point... But what is the thought process here for getting a woman to respond to that? It obviously screams desperation, but also says getting your need for sex fulfilled is the only thing on your agenda. You don't think she has needs or wants? 

Ad photos= dick pics galore, including some from multiple angles.

This is really what has me shaking my head. I just don't understand.. I've never taken, let alone sent, a dick picture. Ladies, does this work? The dick pics I managed to stomach and look at were not what I figured people would be interested in seeing. Why post a picture when your dick is tiny? Oh, that nice rash and scab, let's take a close up of that! Can you find that dick hiding in that patch of hair that hasn't been trimmed in 15 years? What kind of hygiene is going on in other places?.. Sorry, my mind is spinning. 

Anyway, again, I apologize on behalf of males everywhere. We're not all disgusting creatures. 

I'm good looking, and have no problems getting dates, but sometimes it's just nice to get laid by someone you can stand to be around and can connect with on a few levels. I know this ad will probably get bypassed by most, because it seems like most women seem to be looking for a serious relationship (although I'll be honest, I'm not sure this is the site for you if that's the case). I just want a hook up, or if we have fun, multiple hook ups. But not just any hook up, I want to be able to feel comfortable, know you're clean and safe, and enjoy your company. If you can handle that and are looking for something similar, feel free to shoot me an email!

Hello!

So I'm not sure if this is the best place to post for this but it seems you can find just about anything on Craigslist right? 

I'm hoping to meet someone who is into fitness/healthy eating (not necessarily obsessively so) to chat about fitness, dieting, workouts, general life stuff and especially how to stay motivated. 

I am not fat by any means but after an injury and long winter, I've gotten a bit soft. It's been hard for me to stay on track with healthy eating and I have lots of vacations and trips coming up that I'd really like to be in shape for. Maybe we can stick to just email/kik, maybe meet up for coffee sometime and maybe even become real life gym buddies if it all works out.

So is there anyone else here in the same boat or interested in this kind of thing? If so just shoot me an email with some info about yourself! 

*Picture not required but appreciated. I am happy to reciprocate after we chat a bit!

Are you having an affair? Did you steal candy from a gas station? Are you worried that your kid is gay? Did you hear a really racially-offensive joke that you'd like to share? Is your husband's cock too small/big/curvy/soft? Is there anything that you'd like to get a guy's perspective on? I'm chock full of opinions and humor!

Please be prepared to use all sorts of colorful language, such as cock, pussy, and fuck (bonus points if you can splice multiple profanities into a single new, colorful word!). If you don't have a sense of humor about all of life's foibles, don't even bother.

About me, I'm in my mid-40s, three kids, a wife, and a prodigious... sense of humor.

Please send me a message with the word 'Sativa' if you'd like to talk. I don't care about your age, marital status, or race... just be prepared to share stories and have some fun.

To start things off, please tell me about either your first time having sex, your first time getting high, or your first time getting arrested. (not all three, just one)

Hi!

Friendly post here. I just thought it would be fun to get a woman's perspective about the gym. 

I've been working out most of my life and always have been fascinated by women in the gym. I by no means stare/gawk- just really appreciate the tight pants, pulled back hair, little sweaty beautiful women that you are!

I feel like I fall in love with multiple women daily. Do any women feel like this too?

About me: 30's, athletic, normal, down-to-earth,fun, told I'm pretty attractive throughout my life( if that matters for conversation, however very humble).

Not looking for mean-spirited responses. Just interesting conversation about the topic. I think about it so much and have never really opened up about it to anyone. So, thought the anonymity of CL would make it comfortable for both of us.

Thanks hope to hear from you soon!

Not quite sure where to post this and really not sure what exactly if anything I'm looking for. Just would be nice to have a decent conversation with someone similar.
I'm about as normal as it comes. Very good looking, hit the gym when I can, married (to a female), good paying job, living comfortably I guess you could say. Sports fanatic, enjoy socializing, trying new craft beers, spending time with family and kids.
On the other side, love everything about an attractive woman and really don't find other guys attractive or appealing sexually. However, I've messed around with a few guys over the years which is really nerve racking and goes against my traditional sexual preferences. It's fun though. The adrenaline and excitement of maybe doing something against the grain if you will. Mixing it up. It's mainly consisted of me getting sucked by the other guy but have stroked another guy before. 
Anyways, like I said would be nice to find someone to talk to with a similar mindset and experiences. Age isn't too much of a concern but probably in your thirties or fourties.

You are sitting alone tonight, wishing for something, but you are not sure what. 

And your thoughts are spinning quietly, as they always do, round and round and round inside your head... and you feel alone. 

You have been with others, many others, but have never really felt ""not alone"" for long. And...your thoughts have never stopped spinning, while the thoughts of others never really seemed to spin in the same way as yours... not for long anyway. 

You have also been with only a few others that you have shared this with... You know, that you have told about your thoughts that have never stopped spinning for long, and how they don't seem to spin like the thoughts of most others do.

But those few others, well, at first, seemed to understand what you were sharing with them, you know, before much time had passed. Maybe before enough time had passed to make their understanding real.

And of those very few others... unfortunately, there were not many that for long, really wanted to hear your thoughts. You know... the thoughts that have never really stopped spinning for long.

And at that point...because it never feels very good to stop them from spinning, you eventually walk away... to let them spin, to let them spin in the way that they need to spin to make you feel alive again.

Over and over and over...this has happened. Has happened to me, anyway. 

Then one day, I realized, that in some way, my spinning thoughts actually make me feel ok, maybe even happy, whether I feel alone or not. 

So now, I just let them spin... I don't stop them, and don't hide them, and never stop sharing them, and never stop being happy, not for long anyway...well, perhaps simply not for as long. There are moments...laugh. 

And I now try to let all others do what they need to do as well, you know, to be happy. So as they do what makes them happy, I don't seem to worry about them, or about myself either. Not as much as I used to, anyway. In any case, most things seems to work out, over time, over some time. 

There is a reason you are reading CL. You want to find someone that you can feel ok sharing with, and let them feel ok sharing with you... 

With this in mind, perhaps you should just ramble on and on and on (like I just did...) and simply not worry about being graded, judged, or changed? Just a thought, my thought at the moment... 

I guess that is what I am trying to do by writing tonight. As I let my thoughts spin, spin, spin,...simply just share a few... without much worry. 

I mean, really, what's there to lose? And, perhaps, what's there to gain? That may be a good question...smile.

I'd like to start off by saying that I'm not a Republican or conservative and have always been a strong believer in gender equity. However the poisonous and bigoted version of ""feminism"" that exists in Minnesota today has nothing whatsoever to do with gender equity and everything to do with shaming, hurting, and marginalizing as many men as possible as badly as possible in the name of ""sisterhood"" and revenge. So I'm looking for those few of you who don't buy into it. I find an anti-feminist or non-feminist attitude in a woman to be an admirable and attractive quality. It shows an independence of thought and an intellectually robust resistance to intense propaganda. I'm a college-educated Caucasian male from a different part of the Midwest. As you can probably tell from this ad I communicate pretty well. So if this ad interests you don't hesitate to contact me. I am open to talking to and meeting women from any race as long as they have not jumped on this man-hating/man-shaming/emasculation bandwagon.

There comes a time in a person life when you feel like you have become silent in your current situation. How that happens or why it happens is unknown.

I am in need of someone I could confide in, share some laughs and maybe become close friends. I see myself as a trustworthy and all around good person. I work a fulltime office job but have time to text and email throughout my day. Posting a CL ad is not something I would have even thought about but I am hoping this works.

There are A LOT of married men who are bisexual, their wife has no clue and would divorce him if she found out. 

Thats what almost all bisexual married men say when I ask them if their wife knows, or I asked them why they don't just tell her about your attraction to men. 

What would you do/say to your husband if he confessed to you he is bisexual. Would you leave him? Kick him out? Or would you accept him for what he is? I don't know the percentage of married men who are bisexual but it's very high, believe me. I was just wondering what a married woman's perspective is on this.

I am looking for something pretty simple in my mind. I am looking for someone that I can chat with throughout the day. Someone to get to know, someone to help the time pass by with and someone to talk to about whatever crosses our minds. This is strictly a platonic friendship that I am looking for.

I am happily married and don't have any kids. My wife works quite a bit including days, nights and weekends and therefore we don't get to talk that much when we are apart. I work a typical Monday through Friday day job. That is why I am looking for a new friend. This can be strictly an email/text thing or maybe we meet for coffee one day. The key is fun conversations.

I have many interests that include board games, bourbon, hiking, camping, Lego's, movies, going to the gym, reading about new topics, playing with my dogs, craft beer, projects around the house and lots of others. I am 33 years old. 

You can be in a relationship or single as long as it's strictly platonic between us. Race doesn't matter. Age would probably be best between 30-40 so that we will have some things in common though it isn't mandatory. Mostly I am looking for someone who can articulate their thoughts, have fun, be open and willing to step out on a limb and get to know someone. If you think that might be you then send me a message and tell me a little bit about yourself.

I hope you have a great day!

I just came across an incredible video recording of Danny Boy (Grainger's Irish Tune/County Derry) performed by a group of 9th and 10th grade orchestra students in Plano, TX. I have taught high school and college-level orchestra for over 21 years, and NEVER have I heard a group of high schoolers play to this level of expertise. They actually outperform many recognized orchestras in legitimate music schools around the country. These are high school freshmen and sophomores--and they are led by a young conductor who we'll be seeing more of in the future, I'm certain!

It takes 4 minutes to listen. You won't believe it.

I'm working at home. Loooong phone meetings on booooring subjects. I haven't even opened my mouth in two hours, except to say ""here"". 

So what the heck. I'll start some Twenty Questions:

1) What's the most inappropriate place you've ever gotten busy? 

2) What's the thing that guys seem to like the most about sex, that you're the most ""Meh"" about?

3) When was your last one-nights stand? 

Feel free to shoot some back. I'm sure not going anywhere...

Just want to exchange emails, learn about you, interests, hobbies, random facts and thoughts, insights, observations, etc.

If your interests mainly involve either sports, country music, working out, politics, religion, camping, hiking, etc., we probably won't have much to talk about. 

Looking for someone that makes an effort in the conversation. Be humorous and not afraid to be silly at times. Not afraid to ask weird, quirky or nonsensical questions.

Sorry I don't Kik or text.

If you're only going to write a sentence or two please don't reply. 

If you think I'm putting this post out because obviously I'm looking for sex but being coy, please punch your junk for me.

Hey ladies! I didn't think I'd find myself resorting to Craigslist to find friends, but here I am! I'm 25, single, and childless (by my own choice, I swear). I like to think that I'm easy to get along with. I'm an introvert so I can be a little shy at first, but I get over it pretty quickly. I was really shy growing up so I'm not lying when I say I currently have ONE friend. One. It's not cool anymore. I have several acquaintances, but I would like some actual friends. Like the type you can talk to about anything and completely be yourself around. Ya know, a REAL friend. If you watch Broad City, Ilana and Abbi's friendship ""is goals."" If you don't watch Broad City, I suggest you start!

The basics about me: I currently work full-time and go to school for photography part-time. I don't like kids, so it'd be great to find someone who doesn't have any. I drink and am 420 friendly, you don't have to be but don't judge me for it. I love animals and am very compassionate about them, I'm a vegetarian, in the process of going vegan. I love to try new activities and go to new places. In my own opinion, I'm hilarious, and I absolutely love to laugh, so a sense of humor is a must! I like to go out on the weekends, but I'm also not opposed to staying in and watching Netflix or gettin down on some classic super nintendo. With summer coming up, I can't wait to get outside and enjoy nature. I could go on for awhile, but I won't. 

If you think we'd hit it off, please send me an email with your favorite movie as the subject so I know you're real (bonus points if Fantastic Mr Fox is your favorite movie). If you have Facebook, send me your link and I will add you, if you'd like. I'm looking to chat briefly and then meet up either for coffee or at a park or anywhere else public. I'm not the biggest fan of communication via technology when it comes to meeting new people so the quicker we can get that out of the way the better. Thanks!

I do not smoke and am not 420 friendly in any way. If you are also looking for someone to talk to please message me and we could communicate over email, or possibly text. Please be between the ages of 28 & 39 years because I want people around the same age as me. I am open to married, divorced, widowed or single men. Please no one over 40. I do have kik messenger if that works best. I am not looking for hook-ups. I am very happily married.

I am wondering if you have ever wanted to share your deepest darkest sexual fantasy? However, you feel your fantasy is too boring, too weird, too taboish, etc. your afraid of being judged by someone?

Why not tell your fantasy to a man you will never meet? I am a very open minded male. I will never judge you no matter what you tell me. I am just very intrigued to find out what women fantasize about. Are you married and fantasize about cheating? Are you single and wanting to do something? 

Please tell me. I promise not to judge you. It will be our secret. Have a great day.

Hello,

It would be nice to meet other women around my age who drink socially and not into smoking, and going clubbing. I am a chill laid-back introvert. I am shy and reserved at times. I like watching movies, making healthy meals, trying new restaurants/cafes/brunches, going to seasonal festivals/events, walking, mini golf, playing tennis and listening to music.. I am for the most part a homebody, but would like to meet a few people to hangout with. I work full time and I do not have any kids. I am also considered low maintenance.

I usually have get togethers with friends once a month. A lot of friends fell off so I'm looking for new friends that I can genuinely connect with. It'll be nice to meet up at a restaurant on Fridays and just vent about out busy work week. 

Random - I like country music.

Friends only. Looking for people I can meet in person or text buddies. Please respond with information about yourself ( including age face pic and gender). Please also note we will not get along if you are loud, ghetto, super pushy, plain ol rude ( not in a joking or sarcastic manner), have no manners, and do not know how to act in public.

Cuddle and chat and snooze as we are comfortable. 

I know you may be skeptical but I'm a married guy that doesn't want to change that. But I'm alone this weekend and would so enjoy some company. I'm a professional guy and well traveled, so I can hold my own in a conversation. Let's try this out.

I'm 35 and have been happily married 15 years. I drink occasionally but don't smoke or do drugs and not into partying. We're child free by choice and not religious. I'm looking for someone who has a similar lifestyle. I like board games and card games. We often have game nights with drinks and taco dip :) I like going for walks and yard sales. I love to read, mostly trashy romance novels. I like cooking and baking and finding new recipes. We like bowling - roller derby - mini golf and going to the drive in. I'm pretty frugal and simple so it doesn't take a lot to make me happy. Cambridge people only.

I am the proud father of a 3 and ½ year old girl. I have been separated from my wife since September, the divorce has went from ugly to civil to nasty. It was to be settled in early April, but due to the fact that issues are unresolved it wasn't finalized. Aside from being in a divorce and custody fight I have a lot of other things going on as well. I am not in legal trouble, nor am I into drugs (which makes me ddf) or anything illegal. I'm very upfront about things, I know some will be intimidated by my situation, but those who aren't will find a teddy-bear of a guy(big, harry and loveable!)
I'm financially embarrassed, which means I don't have money (I'm self-sufficient and not looking for someone to take care of me!) I'm creative when it comes to doing things, even with little or no money. I'm adventurous and like to experience new things. I'm looking for friends, if anything develops out of that I'm more than ok with it. I have lots of time on my hands, I don't currently work due to a spine condition. I'm still mobile, yet I have days where I move slowly. I enjoy things like music (country, older rock, pop, etc. . .), movies (especially comedies as I like to laugh), fishing, sports (Twins, Vikings. . .), other outdoor activities. . . I also like to go to Theatres, concerts, dinners, and other activities where I dress up.
I'm a person who will be honest and open. I believe in communication, it's what cost me a marriage and in my opinion one of the biggest sources conflicts in any relationship. I also will bend over backwards for a friend. I am seeking someone who doesn't mind that I will on occasion blow up their phone when I need a friend, and know that they can do the same. I also believe in apologizing when I do make a mistake and appreciate being told when I make one. I sometimes need to think about what I did, but I will always apologize. I am looking for someone who understands that if we get mad, laugh, hug, cry, etc. . .everything is going to be fine with us and we can still be friends and be there for one another!
If this sounds interesting to you, I would love to hear from you. I prefer texting to start, as I don't have internet and use Wi-Fi when I email. I live in Hinckley and would prefer someone that lives in the area or can come to the area as I can't afford to drive.
Thanks,

Teddy Bear Dad

NOTE: This is a PLATONIC invitation - I am only seeking a friend to share an evening at the movies.

Want to go tonight 4/10? Now showing: Superman vs Batman, Deadpool, and 10 Cloverfield Lane.
- all are unseen by me and of interest... Might still be there next weekend...

I am looking to meet a nice gal to accompany me to the Drive-In movies, as a friend now...
- and please, a remote chance of a future long-term friend or more...

You:
While I am not seeking a literal 'date' - I would prefer if you were also in the market for a LTR (I am) as the possibility of this evening progressing towards friendship and further dates would be very nice.
Would you agree - an evening is always funner if you are with someone you enjoy being with... 

So I ask only a few things = Please be:
- between 20 and 50 
(if you are under 40, I would be glad to go only as friends, yet still request matching all)
- any height
- healthy please - Skinny, Average or A few extra. (within 30 lb of HWP)
- clean and D/D free. 
- not a BBW please. 
- not a person who uses 420 or any form of drugs!
As I mentioned, my hope is to develop a friendship which may progress to more in time. 
Besides, if we are healthy and clean - we can both be comfortable sharing popcorn... 

I'm the one doing the driving and hosting, so all I ask is to please be a woman who at least I can enjoy feeling comfortable around and enjoy talking with... and I am not comfortable with one who does not match the characteristics above...

I would hope to swap photos and type some first... maybe even swap cell #s and talk some - I do want you to feel safe and enjoy the evening so it is important you are OK before we go. The point of the evening is to share the movies with a friend - nothing more. 

Who knows, we may get to like each other... or just become incredible friends... right?!
That is it - I have NO expectations beyond enjoying the movies and the company of a friend.
And yes - this is a rewrite of a 2012 post, so I have posted this on and off for 4 years, and have gone a few times and had a nice time. One became a friend and we typed for years till she married some guy.

Me:
I am a 56 yo, 6'5"", white, nearly average, D/D and and coffee free. My other interests are bicycling, walks, hiking, travel - weekend road-trips or other, canoeing/kayaking, just being active and enjoying the outdoors - before the next snowfall... then a new list... :)
(I do not drink coffee - my vice is Diet Mountain Dew! after all, have to be awake for the drive home)...

Why the drive-in?
3 movies for $8.50... And I spring for the gas to get there (around $5-$6). 
When it gets warmer, we can sit outside if the mosquito's aren't bad - yet for now - my car has some comfy luxurious leather seats with a nice center console to hold the drinks... We can get some dinner from Subway or take-out of your choice en-route, and spend the evening watching 2 or 3 movies and having someone to talk and laugh with! 

About timing and parking: We have to get there early as the theater will have cars waiting all the way to the high-way waiting to pack all the decent up-front spots by 7 pm (7:30 Sundays). We should plan on getting there by 6:45 pm (or 7:15 Sundays) to get in line for the front good spots (Best spots are 1/2 way between the screen and concession stand in the shadowed area of the photo).
Getting there early is beneficial anyways - besides a great spot for a better view of the movie, we will have plenty of time to talk, eat dinner and get to know each other before the show.

So - WHY am I writing this invitation? Besides the fact it is embarrassing to go to the drive-in alone... and I have. It is so much more fun sharing the evening with a friend. Someone to talk to during intermission, laugh at the funny parts, and yes - maybe get a bit teary at serious moments, of course, depends on the movie. And yes - I do not talk as much as I type... 

So - email me, lets type a bit, maybe chat, and get ready to go to Vali-Hi some weekend or weekday evening soon - maybe even tonight! 
We can even meet any time/day before - if you want to before we go... 
Thanks for reading and Have a Great Day/night - Look forward to email/chatting with you...

I know best friends since high schools who never bring up sex when they meet up and even I know married couples who not do not talk about sex but are barely having. We continue to be a society that never talks about and is more ashamed about it. And the only way we are comfortable dealing with it is if we are Judging someone, if its in a movie, or if sex is being used to sell a Car, adult diapers, or new laundry detergent.

I would especially love to hear from you if you have a very active sex life whether people know about it or even better do not know about it and its a side-thing. Also big plus if you are into poly or non-monogamy.

Sometimes having someone to talk to about a part of your life you are living but not sharing with others can be very Validating. There is a real chance we are NEVER going to meet and this might all be via Email. I could be open to coffees during the day to share and discuss. I could be open to other things as well.

*Please be discreet, mature, respectful and have time to Write/Email Frequently🌹🌹🌹. If you can not find time to write or long emails to read and write are not your thing, then this is not the ad for you. Also if you do not have a lot of sexual experiences, this is not the ad for you either. I want a Woman who does not apologize about your activities or thoughts.

I am not into body-shaming. I respect people of all different ages, shapes, sizes, and shapes. Diversity makes the world beautiful!

Weather looks great. If it doesn't work out this time, let's think about a future ride. Ping me and go from there.

Put ""Nauti Hawg"" in the header to confound the bots. Looking forward to a great season :)

Not looking for sex.

Smoker. I don't understand majority of people. What really matters is never addressed. Conversation beyond that is important. This world is hurting, I'm tired of feeling all of it. Life can be so much more than this. Take me away from myself for a bit. If you aren't a fan of Bernie, you won't like me.
I am 27, I shouldn't feel this old. 

Thank you.

I know absolutely nothing will come of this ad except a bunch of porn bots etc. But, you never know I guess. I am a divorced male with 2 children whom I have part time. Needless to say I am not even close to ready for a relationship. I do however need to meet some people as friends. I have no clue how to go about even meeting someone to hang with. Its not that I am an introvert, or shy around people its just that I have been out of practice for the past years. 

For fun I like to watch any kind of sports, explore the city, hang at the lakes. I also like watching movies or hanging at home watching Netflix. I also have recently started at the gym and found that I actually enjoy it. 

So I guess in ending I am just looking for someone that wants to start a friendship. Not picky on ages or anything just wanna find someone to be able to talk/hang with. If something more happens great if not thats ok also.

Perhaps you are like me. You wonder how you got here. You never imagined yourself searching Craigslist for a posting that might connect with what is missing in your life. You are an intelligent person and have opportunities, but getting involved with friends and coworkers would be a mistake, so you play it safe.
You are looking to scratch that itch which you feel in quiet moments and all too often you feel yourself writing off even though you desire it strongly. I have come to figure that these moments are the quiet desperation that Thoreau wrote of and part of me is still not willing to go peacefully and accept this in life.
So here I am. 
I am a good natured, outgoing person whom is confident with who I am and how I appear. I am creative and have many activities that keep me busy and I will try anything once. I don't have any vices that are too harmful with the exception of searching Craigslist for what is missing in my life or marriage. I tend to think that even though I am
happy with what I have , I still keep pushing myself to develop as a person, and yet still find myself wanting of the passions that are not in my everyday life. Upon deeper reflection, i believe I tend to yearn more for the opportunity to let out these thoughts than try to fulfill them- meaning a friend or confidant with which to share and get feedback from, and in return would do the same.
I dream of the opportunity of a woman that would sit down next to me and strike up a conversation which would grow into an undefined and deep personal connection for us. We would share ideas, laughs, coffee and whatever the other one needs with no pressure or judgement. This would not be a relationship of expectations or dependency, but one that supports the other. It would be a safe place in which we would be able to be that person aloud that we don't usually show the world. 

What traits am I looking for?
Nothing too complicted; 
Strong character
Good sense of humor
Intelligent

Right. I'm just going to be simple with the ad here in regards to what I'm looking for.
If the idea is of interest to you, reply to it, we can talk and see how well we get along. 

Basically, what I'm looking for is someone who has an interest in something... a skill, a hobby, some other kind of activity, that they want to pursue. Particularly if you're new at it... I meet a lot of people into some of my interests, but they aren't interested in me since I have yet to ""catch up"" to their level. 

Things I personally am interested in:
Arts & Crafts, particularly drawing and sewing, though I'm interested in any kind of craft or DIY sort of thing.
Costume-making/cosplay/make-up or anything along those lines.
Writing.
Cooking. 
Health stuff. Not really looking for a workout buddy or anything like that since I work out on my own, but it'd be nice to have like an accountability friend who is trying to be healthier as well.
Learning languages. This is a big one, I could really use someone who wants to be language buddies. Currently interested in Swedish, Finnish, Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean (I've studied Swedish and Mandarin a bit, the others I'm almost completely new).


And hey, if you *are* super great at one of these and wouldn't mind hanging out with a newb while working on are crafts together, that'd be super cool too.

Have a nice day, hope to hear from someone!

Hello there :)
I am a 31 year old single woman living in Blaine.
I work a M-F job in Fridley, is low pay, but am working on other personal improvements before changing jobs.
I am extremely open, geeky, love boardgames, listening and discovering new music (I honestly do this the most with my 9 year old nephew :-b), love hanging out with my niece and nephews, but had my tubes tied not to have my own children, love to bowl, go to movies, play miniature golf, hike, camp, go for walks, just hang out and talk, etc.
I am not girly in appearance, I pull my hair in a ponytail 90% of the time, I never wear make up, all about comfort. I am most comfortable in shorts and skirts, so that's what you'll see me in unless I just got off of work as I am required to wear pants there.
I am not a clubber or bar hopper, so would never join in those escapades.

I am unable to travel myself, I take the bus to and from work, but the buses in Blaine stop running at 6pm M-F and don't run on weekends. So, would need to be someone close by.

If you have any questions, feel free to drop a line. Even though I am single, I don't care of your status. You can be married, mother, single, gay, straight, etc. As I am looking for friends to talk to and hang out with :).

Straight to the point....I am bored and starting to get tired of being alone. Being single in your late 30s is not very fun. Most of my friends have married and become distant. Me, I have yet to find the ""one"". The problem I have is I am attracted to guys. I have tried to reject those feelings all my life but I just can't force myself to love a woman. Plenty of relationships that to me have felt more like friendship ended because they want someone to love them. Everyone deserves that. My dilemma do I continue to try and find a woman that I love or face the facts and start seeing men. I am the type of person who likes to blend in, not flashy, I don't crave attention, just a simple guy. Blending in as a gay man will be a challenge. Although you could say I have been doing just that for a long time. I'm a nice guy and have worked hard to get my professional life together. Now it is time to focus more on my personal life. If you can relate to anything here reach out and let's chat. Not interested in anyone older or partnered. Put your age in the subject line.

I am looking for a friend to talk to regularly on snapchat or kik or something. I am with someone but it's basically for our kid that we don't split . It's just easier to stay together. I miss having someone to talk to. I want to have a awesome friend! And not just a flavor of the week situation, I really want to be important to someone and for you to mean a lot to me :)

The title could be a good story line or a verse line...

It need not be taken literally, but could be.

The gist: I had a long professional exam today and now I am in the mood for not thinking, but instead toasting, sitting across from a pleasant girl, toasting and discussing something meaningful/less...

The date can be platonic, plUtonic, any kind of tonic...Best if not ""plague-tonic"". But any other kind of tonic (and gin if you like). 

I could be your genie (and I like ""Jeanne""s, ""Jenny""s and ""Jenna""s). And I am fond off all things ingenious (being a genius myself). Ingenuous (trusting) is all right, too, in this case. And I guess I don't mind if you wear jeans, if you like (I think I have good genes, too).

Today would be just fine.

Hurry, the whole single female of Minneapolis is in line:)

However, I am not opposed to getting one.

I am seeking a female who is active and has a few pounds to lose. Or someone who is extremely fit and wants to help push me to the next level. I am sorry but I am not sure a beginner can push me enough. However, I am happy to help you. We are all in this together. I live in the Minnetonka area and just want to meet a female who wants to go for walks, excersise, bike rides, runs, lift weights, yoga, pilates, anything. I just want to help keep each other motivated this winter. We are I. This together with one common goal. To lose weight and get in shape.

Ok. I know I'm in the ""strictly platonic"" section. And that's pretty accurate, but 'strictly' seems like a strong word. Yes, I'm married and I need to stay that way. You need to be married too.

My kids are my priority and always will be. I'm an intelligent, educated professional.

I'm hoping to find someone who likes to write. The evidence suggests that I'm a fairly reliable correspondent, as I'm still in touch with penpals I've had since the '80s. Yes, I live in the Boston area, but I thought it might be fun to make the acquaintance of someone from this part of the country.

I'm an enthusiastic urban walker, have never been in a fistfight, am often praised for my sense of humor, like to hang out in used bookstores, can carry a tune, have a vivid imagination, and know a thing or two about a thing or two. 

Will this lead to something else? Hard to say. Sometimes a correspondence is a prelude to another kind of relationship, sometimes the correspondence IS the relationship.

Write to me. Tell me stuff. Thank you.

Hello,

So maybe this is just a bit of a rant, but I'm also a little curious who's out there. See, I have this problem. On a scale of 1-10 it's like a 13. I used to be very social, too social maybe, and of course only with women. Despite several efforts, I've just never been close to any men. I guess maybe it's because women are cuter and I can flirt with them. And you know that feeling you get when you think someone is just a little bit interested in you? Like they hang off everything you say, even when you're just being yourself?

Anyway, then I got married and due to several events, dropped literally every person in my life outside of family so that my marriage wouldn't fall apart. I totally understand it's not good to be close to another woman when you are married. However, it's been 3 years now and I'm really having a hard time with it. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if I had just someone to talk to, but I don't. I work from home and am with my wife literally 24/7. I love her to death, but sometimes she just drives me crazy too.

So, yeah, like I said, I'm venting. Probably not many who care, or should care. Sometimes I'm glad I don't talk to anyone, I've always been a bit of a loner. But sometimes...like now, I long for it. So much so that my whole body craves for it like an earthquake, tearing every cell and throwing it to pieces. Nothing wrong with casual emails right? No...it's not true, because if she knew, she would be devastated. So yeah, maybe you understand, and maybe you respect marriage, which you should. Just let me vent, it feels good to just tell someone, even if I have no idea who you are.

Are you simply tired of trying to exchange with the average person? 
Are you wired in a way that you have never actually felt as though you fit in...for long anyway? 
Have you never stopped looking for a path that would bring you to thoughts, situations, and opportunities that you didn't already know about?

Are you tired of being alone, mentally, not long after most relationships begin? 
Do you think you will never actually not feel alone because of the way you think, the way you simply can't turn it off for long? 

Have you gotten to the point where there now seems to be more comfort in simply spending most of your time alone? 
Have you done this for a while now, but still...

Can't stop wondering? 
Can't stop thinking that you are surely not alone in the way that you are wired? 
Can't stop asking where there are others like you? 
No, not the same, but those that have thoughts that simply won't stop occuring either? 

Questions that won't stop being asked, but hold little interest to others it seems? 
(No interest, unless you become famous, of course!) 

If you would like to try exchanging in this direction, try from your direction.

Really, what have you got to lose? I can't see you, I can't hear you, I can't make you stay around. I can be blocked and deleted.

So... 

Start with words of thought. 
Any words that hold value to YOU! 

Start with a drawing.
Any type of drawing that you have created or enjoy staring upon.

Start with something you have written or read.
Something that holds value to you, whether you understand it or not.

Start with questions.
Questions you have lived with, that you know have no definite answers.
Questions you have about what I have shared. I may not answer. I don't have to answer anything!

Start by sharing a peek at the fire that keeps your head ablaze.
You know, the fire you have often attempted to put out.

Not because it actually ever hurt you.
But because others told you to.
Or made you feel weird when they saw it.

I won't ever tell you to put it out.
Because I never tell myself to put mine out either.

Want to show me that those like you don't exist, by not responding? Do it if it holds value for you. 
Will that hold value for you?
Give it some thought, it may or may not...smile.

I'm just looking around for people to talk to. I'm a very open person, and just enjoy meeting new people. I love to read, hang with friends, write, listen to music, watch tv/movies, and so much more!

If you're looking for someone to just talk to about anything, feel free to chat with me :)

Hope you're having a great day and looking forward to warmer temps soon!

I'm looking for someone I can have a conversation with pretty regularly. I'd like to get to know you, your likes and dislikes, your wants and needs, just anything you'd like to share with me and I will reciprocate. I'm doing this mostly because I find myself getting bored every now and then so I thought it would be fun to have someone to text and have a real conversation with when I am bored. 

This will be strictly platonic as I don't imagine I will ever meet you in person. All I'm asking is that you be truthful, honest, and genuine in our conversation. I want this to be something fun and enjoyable, so hopefully it is. 

I'm open to talking to just about anyone who can hold a conversation and isn't a try-hard. Someone who is looking for the same thing and isn't going to pretend to be someone else to make it happen. 

I'm looking forward to hearing from you and getting rid of this boredom :)

I am a in shape, good looking, normal/sane, mid 40's white male seeking a college aged female to give me a back massage. I am NOT looking for a pro or a ""happy ending"". It seems all of the massage therapists that advertise on CL are really nasty and gross. I just want a normal, nice looking girl with experience or no experience to give me an aprox. 1 hour back massage. Maybe you are in school to become a certified massage therapist and need to practice? I was thinking a college girl needing money would be perfect? I will consider others but no working girls posing as ""massage therapists"" please! So 18 plus for sure ok? If it goes well we could meet twice a month or more. I have been training 5 days a week getting back in great physical shape but my back is really tight from all the exercise. I'm thinking 40 - 50 dollars per time? No men please.

Mutal attraction is important when looking for a date. I'm looking to get to know your personality and brain after I know if I am physically attracted to you. 
Then meet up after going through my catfish proof verification. .lol.. 
Meeting up is to see if the connection we've established grows or deminishes. 
I'm awesome. I'm confident, sexy, easy on the eyes, have my shit together and want to find someone who isn't looking to screw right away. 
I love to laugh, smile, be happy and grow into a better person than I was yesterday. 
All and all i want a man I can be comfortable around, who loves to give me attention and wants it in return. A man who is attentive, happy, funny, awesome likes to be active or just relax at home and is versitile in that manner. 

Please send a picture and a little bit about yourself for a response. 
You should be 36-41 , easy on the eyes, no more than one child, preferably none
and be white.

Attraction doesn't mean that you have to be a model. It means that I find something I find attractive about you from the shape of your eyes, the shape of your head to your height and smile. 
I mean come on now x there are people out there that have the ugliest dogs and their owners think they are so adorable. 

I'm pretty spiritual but not religious. Open minded and down to earth and the realist person you will meet. 
I'm not typically active but not opposed to getting out there and doing things.

I recently relocated back to Mpls, and have this urge to go play bingo at Mystic. I think it'd be fun to find one other person, or a small group, and all we do is every once in a while get together to play bingo. Or go see comedy improv shows. 

I'm not a big drinker, don't smoke, don't do drugs, and don't really gamble much. I hit Vegas a few times a year for work, but mostly just play a few hands of blackjack and call it a day.

I'm gay, but most of my friends are straight guys I went to highschool with. So whether you're straight or gay or bi or whatever, it's a non-issue.

Mainly, I'd like to make another friend, and just do something outside the norm, like bingo. 

I'm 39, white, chill, and really don't care about age. Just please, for the love of God, this is in strictly platonic for a reason. I'm in no way looking for anything other than a friend to hangout with playing bingo at Mystic (if I haven't made myself clear by now).

Is it possible for an attached guy to find an attached girl with the same unhappy issues in their relationship? It would be nice to find someone who does not judge or say things like ""if you are not happy then just leave"". I would like to find someone who understands that ""leaving"" is much easier said than done. People change over time. I am not convinced that the human species was ever meant to be monogamous. Why you may ask? Well that is a conversation for another time. Simply put I miss the excitement, butterflies, and passion! Are there women out there who feel like this? Are you tempted to act on these feelings, have you, or would you? There is much to be said on this issue. I would not rule out meeting someone new who, like me, is seeking the same thing and not just a quick random hook-up.

I could not be any less like the creature that most of you seek. 

Your desires outlined with so many words about soul mates, perfect families, dream jobs, and a vast network of close friends. Just normal, normal, normal.

I find it funny (or not so funny?), that two drinks and fifteen minutes (or an hour and a cup of coffee) usually reveals worlds full of addiction, hyper-sexual (therefore non-sensual) acting out, artists that love being artists but hate art, groupies that like bands but not music, victims (survivors) of bad decisions, bad health, bad relationships, and bad luck. 

Anything poetic seems to be stopped, anything significant seems to cease, and the ennui of day to day and skin to skin seems to creep in. So you hate your job, everyone does, or they wouldn't call it a job would they? Everyone hates someone in their family, familiarity breeds contempt. Yes, when you get drunk you sleep with people you don't know and are likely to get diseases, so don't get so drunk. Sorry, there is no ""bad"" art at the Walker, Weisman, or MIA, because ""bad"" art doesn't mean anything. How can you not hate your Ex who tried to destroy you? And no, at your age you don't need silicone boobs... 

We all have our story, it's just the deception that turns me off. 

To be very upfront, I am undate-able at the moment..(or so says my best friend.) 

Therefore, I am seeking a similarly undate-able woman of extraordinary (well, I'm not extraordinary, but...) ability to write and perhaps spend time with (really maybe, maybe, maybe some day eventually) until the world decides we are date-able again. 

If you are intellectually out of this world (intellectual base, that is), emotionally and psychologically out of your mind from time to time, and promise not to write ""what was that about?"" when I send slightly poetic but nonsensical emails, please respond.

Teasing and all that goes with this lost...art. Would you like to explore a sensual but non sexual relationship? Might make your nights more enjoyable. Lots to think about, isn't there.

You should be full figured with large breasts and bottom. Great mind and very naughty thoughts you need to get off your chest. Age is open. 

This would be a LTR, if all goes well. We can always adjust the expectations if we decide later to do so.

Hello-

I am a responsible goofy 29 year old female looking for friends. I would love to find/make a group of friends that will hang out and do fun activities with.

I'm originally from northern MN and that is where most of my family and friends are. I've been down here for awhile but am really missing a great group of friends to enjoy life with.

I like a large variety of activities and I find I get along with almost all personality types. I enjoy going to movies, bowling, fun new restaurants, I love tabletop games, cooking, and just hanging out with good people. I'm not much of a drinker but I don't mind having a few drinks with friends. I am trying to get motivated into fitness again and would love to find a workout partner besides my dog.

I'm not interested in starting an intimate relationship with anyone at this time. I just miss the genuine support of friends.

I'm an educated, kind, average person. If you find you also want to improve your social life and meet new people feel free to respond.

Are you wired differently? 

Your thoughts are not the same as most people around you? 

You have dated, perhaps been married, but after a while, you find that you are no longer happy. 

A voracious reader? Perhaps a consistent writer or artist? Undoubtedly an unstoppable thinker? 

Yet, over and over, you find yourself alone, wondering what exactly is different about you?

If you would like to share your thoughts, I would like to read them and share mine.

I don't think I am alone in this perception, but finding those who share the experience is often difficult.

Perhaps it is for you too...

I don't get how I'm here right now. Alone, unloved, empty. I've just tried to follow all the rules and do the right thing. I know a weeping man is very unattractive to women, so I don't expect any female responses (I'm sure I'll get all kinds of sympathy from gay men... don't worry no one has to know right?). I guess I'm writing this post because I have nothing else to do. I've written posts and profiles on dating sites before, but nothing like this. This is more of a rant -- a cry for help -- than it is an advertisement. I'm well aware many of the things I'm writing here are a 'no-no' if I seriously wanted to catch somebody's romantic interest. 

I've poured my heart both into others and into myself. I am drained emotionally because of it and have no-one there to support me, which I desparetly need. 

By most measures, I 'have it all' -- good looks (atheltic body and handsome), successful job (6 figures), and caring/loving personality... and yet after three decades, I can't make a meaningful connection with a real attractive female. I'm not talking about sex, and my standards are high (as they should be) but not ridiculous. For example, everyday I run out of 'likes' on Tinder (meaning I'm swiping right a bunch). It's crazy so many women I get matched up with won't even talk to me -- what's the point of a match? It seems the only ones who will are actually fake profiles, robots who follow some script which ultimately leads to some website.

Even though I am kind and good hearted, I have an assertive, type A personality. I have always been associated with leadership positions wherever my school/career have taken me. I'm the guy who runs meetings, delegates tasks, as well as 'gets things done' when no one else will. All this to say that I am much much closer to Marty McFly than his father, George.

Because of my giving personality, however, I have been taken advantage of. I have given, given given... and it seems I am always on the same side of giving/receiving. I was involved in a long distance relationship with a woman I never actually met for over five years. It wasn't a catfish but at this point it might as well have been. I thought I had a connection there but in the end it appears there wasn't one. And apparently, from the view of those I interact with daily in person, I don't need any support. I will admit I don't exude any vulnerability so I can see why people aren't prodding to find it. But it is there. And it is crippling me tonight. I just don't know what to do anymore. 

My primary love language is touch. It is killing me inside to have gone this long without ever having a women I can just connect and cuddle with. I just want someone to hold me. To just love me without it being about sex, favors, partying, etc. I just need love... even if it's just for one night, and I am beginning to feel like I'll never have it....

I have a few couple friend coming with me to Chicago, on June 31st until July 2nd. Its for a July 1st Guns N' Roses concert.

This would be an all expense paid trip. Including First Class plane tickets, fine dining, hotel room with two beds as this is a no pressure trip.

I'm 35 and I'm not looking for a girl friend anytime soon. So I'd like to find a good looking female to be my date and like usual to show off to my friends.

I'm not looking for a hooker rather a friend. 

Again maybe I'm doing this all wrong but i thought I'd try.

* Public humiliation. Humiliate me in a restaurant, verbally, etc.
* PAnty shopping. Victoria's Secret or other store, humiliation in front of salesgirls, etc.
* Diaper humiliation. Parade me around in diapers, humiliate me. In mall perhaps?
* Sissy maid for the day. Private of course. If you need a sissy maid to clean your place for a few hours, happy to do it!
* small penis humiliation. I have 1 inch when soft, 4 when hard. make me show it in front of you and your girlfriends, see it whither in my panties.
* Meet at a bar, make me buy drinks for you. Laugh at me for wearing panties, snap my bra, slap my face, throw a drink on me. Verbally taunt me, unleash whatever frustrations you have. (This would have to be saturday).
* Just friendly coffee, but feel free to laugh at me, again, verbally abuse me or just make me get up and leave you alone. 

I am married and don't live in MN so this is a one-time thing. but can also tribute (or if you're up for just doing for fun, great!

hope your wild but not like super crazy wild.. but that is otay if you areeee. I visit the cities often and always have lots of free time. I am looking to find someone that likes to do stuff.

I party with pretty much everything.. And nothing.. soooo I really do not care what the deal is... I have just been helluvha bored everytime I work in the cities and it is getting niceeeee out and it would be really cool if I had a bum to bummmm with....!!! I love most positive people *lol* I am a really positive person myself. I am very easy to get along with, laugh with, dance with, and probably cry with. I love talking about everything and nothing... I am a pretty handsome fella.. Educated & stuffs ~ been through a lot so relating to the struggle is not exactly hard for me. not exactly a big drinker, but I can throw down in any direction... wana just go for a walk around a lake after eating some decent food, then snuggle up with conversation and wine that's solid.. wana drive around and hot box my car that is also fine by me. Listening to different music all night, perfect! I just do not have a place for hosting... as I stay with friends when I am in the cities.. i work weekends so weekdays around the weekend are best or perhaps saturday late nights or Sunday late nights for getting weird and silly work best for me! if your cool enough and plans are fun I'm always down for spending a weekend together when I am freeee... Sooo hit me up, let's laugh and forget about some problems for awhile.. Things I won't do: judge anything, creep around, get strange, make piggish comments, nor will I try to steal your pants... just a really fun, kinda witty dude looking to enjoy the twin cities this summer... Maybe if your cool enough I can buy us tickets for the art in the park and we can dance with Lucy this summer or not.. There are a million things to doooo at least give me something to try..!!! I promise I won't be all retarded drunk or drugged up when we meet & hang out.. I just enjoy these things..

Hello, 
37, and as the title of the post states, I'm married. Considered handsome by many, as down to earth and laid back as can be, but I come with a bit of a naughty streak. 
Not looking to change either of our home situations. Maybe you are the unassuming soccer mom type that has a bit of a naughty streak of your own, or maybe your husband travels or works non stop. It would be nice to add some excitement from the routine that sometimes becomes more of a grind in the doldrums of marriage. I am gainfully employed, d&d free, non smoker, fit and athletic etc..., but am left with a lot of free time. It seems to be a one in a million shot on cl to meet someone who is exactly what we are looking for, but I enjoy reading the posts of others, and have had the chance to me some people from here. Maybe you will enjoy reading my post and respond to me. (fingers crossed) I don't think I'll disappoint, but you can't please everyone. It is supposed to be beautiful out the rest of the week. Not sure how else you want me to probe my realness. Do women have to deal with fake posters as well? Spring fever is in the air let's enjoy it together.

IS there any women on Craigslist that are just bored/lonely/unsatisfied with their marriage. I am pretty sure i am not alone. Its like a vacuum sucks out all that was good and it doesn't ever come back.

Anyway i am a married 37 year old. I an 6'1 240 college educated professional. I don't know what i want really. Maybe a friend that shares a similar situation? Maybe someone who would some day want to meet? I don't know. 

Once i get to know you I would share a pic. I am open to whatever you look like, age, race. I am real. Wild playoffs start tonight. Go Wild!

I should start off by saying I am attached and not getting the attention and respect I want at home. Educated professional that has a lot on his plate and just wants someone that will text or email on and off throughout the day. I must say I don't reply instantly to texts because I am doing things but always get back as soon as possible. 
I am looking for a woman to talk to, someone with perspective without judgement. I want to have deep conversations about abstract and concrete subjects. I like all sorts of music, sports, and random things. I wouldn't mind a little flirting to build excitement. I'm not sure if I would actually meet in person but depending on if there is chemistry, I am open to it. I prefer someone that is married or in a similar situation this way I know there will be discretion. Like most people say, I am not looking to change my situation. 
You should be between 24-40 and easy on the eyes. I consider myself attractive. Race is unimportant. I speak fluent spanish and some french so that is a plus if you do as well.
I will trade pics once I get one first to confirm its not anyone I know.

The birds and the bees? Wouldn't you like to play with me? 
I would like to play with thee!

Spring has sprung and your weary hooks need a break,
The Playtex 24 hour look is really such a fake. 
Why not release your big girls from imprisonment and breathe free,
whilst I fondle you appreciatively and, yes, you guessed it, cum on thee. 

Now comes the best part when we giggle and laugh,
And realize that we acted like that!
But after a bit our senses come back,
Then you'll be asking for seconds and another....this time... gentle Honey Bee attack.

WM/WF+nice looks+erotic+mature+seeking regular battles with that nasty mean Playtex! Subdue those cantilevers! Free up and down your hidden bumper crop. Get back to nature. Take a deep breath! Changes your whole posture, doesn't it? And attitude, nicely. Oh yes, I think I am feeling human again? Amazing, can we bottle this? Would you like to worship the Venus of Willendorf with me on a regular basis over coffee, conversation and THEE?

I promise to be a good boy. My hygiene is impeccable, my nails always trimmed, fresh clean breath and sparkling smile, I'll even take out the garbage, fold the laundry, fill up the dishwasher...I mean might as well be productive between worship services!

If you would like to discuss initiation into our private sect, secret passcode and handshake, WRITE! And yes, I know, playtonic with plenty of wiggle room for is if you want to move this into another category of our own!

I am a married man with a decent job. I am reasonably happy - but of course life could be better in all aspects. I have hobbies (but with two kids, may not have enough time for them), I have changed jobs and moved to different cities, I have had a couple of affairs (that were exciting but also left me feeling a bit guilty) but I can't seem to find what I am looking for.

People find me positive, optimistic, and forward looking but I have internal struggles and some days, I feel like stepping outside this role I am playing. I feel like I am missing a muse, a reference point for happiness, a confidant, a mentor, and even a lover (my dear wife, who has given me many good things life, leaves me unsatisfied when it comes to love). 

If you are around my age (between 35 and 40), either in similar situation or maybe you could relate to me, I would love to hear from you. Maybe you are an avid reader, fitness enthusiast, traveler,...we can talk about anything. Also, I am thinking this as a virtual friendship with a realistic possibility of meeting someday.

Okay, I realize this request is extremely specific and maybe a little unorthodox, but what the hell, it's Craigslist...right?

The short version: I love working out, I am big into fitness and neither my wife (yes, I said wife) nor my friends share this passion. The adrenaline, the feeling of accomplishment and the excitement that this part of my life brings out needs to be celebrated, it wants to be fueled by someone else with similar goals and experiences. My wife and friends do not understand and frankly don't want to talk about it. I guess I am kind of looking for a BFF (best fitness friend). Someone to help push me, someone I help to push. Share successes, failures and someone to keep each other on track! Maybe we work out together, maybe we just root each other on, maybe someone to say ""get out of bed and get your ass to work!!!"". I think these feelings and these experiences need to be shared and celebrated and what better than someone experiencing the same thing, maybe needing a little help and just excited about being healthy???

So, why am I looking for a woman you ask? Well, let me say this up front. I am looking for nothing besides a BFF and this is a totally innocent platonic post, however, working out and fitness comes with some excitement and tension I thought I could be exciting to share this with someone that these feelings could simmer a bit. Because this is innocent, I don't care if you are married, single, engaged...whatever. Just looking for someone who shares my passion and maybe looking for a partner to share it with.

I don't need to share pics, but am far from afraid too if you are interested. Let's start with talking about our goals, our routines and maybe try to help each other on where to go. Maybe we email each other just once and we move on with some good ideas, or maybe we text every day helping push each other to the next level and maybe even work out together. Cardio, lifting, intense, laid back, I am open to anything. 

If any of this sounds like something interesting, send me a line and let's chat?

Thanks!!!

I moved to Minnesota in December and I have yet to make friends with similar interests. Sure, I'm into normal stuff-- I love walks, shopping, tennis, nail art and make up, reading/writing, trying new restaurants, etc. but I'm a pretty creative tomboy too and I'm also into single track mountain biking, independent comics and graphic novels, PIZZA, music (mostly punk, metal and indie), and retro arcade games.

I'm working a couple part time jobs at the moment until I find a full time job that I really feel would suit me long term. I'm married and early in pregnancy. This will be my first child and I'm scared/excited. I'm an agnostic pansexual and open minded when it comes to lifestyes of all kinds.

I'm looking for a friend to just be myself around. I know I'm a weirdo, but I'm a fun, loyal friend. We could eat junk food and talk about MTV shows.

If I sound like somebody you'd like to hang out with and maybe develop a solid friendship with, please message me with some info about yourself. I'd be happy to share my Facebook page if you want to see more of what I'm into.

I'm looking for a texting friend. You know the kind that wants to get to know someone. Skate the ups and downs of relationships, life, and the oh fuck what am I gonna do now moments.

I am reasonably bright, more kind than not, more fit than not, and passably attractive. I also have a pretty long history of working to deal with depression, as well as anxiety. And kind of flirted with addiction for some years, though completely clean and sober for years now, without going to AA or anything. I just stopped enjoying being wasted, I guess. Regardless, want to throw out that I never did anything worse than pot ... just did that and drinking kind of a lot.

Right! So honestly, not expecting *anyone* to respond to this, at this point! See, here is my problem ... I have a decent job, I've been to college (BA), I have immediate and long-term goals, I am interested in other people and I have a sense of humor ... but, I guess I am/have been dysfunctional in a number of ways, as well, and that does not make for the greatest small talk. Unless, I guess, you are talking with someone who is equally dysfunctional.

I am single, never married, and no kids ... and at this stage in my life, I find it understandable but also pretty sad, that it is easier to find someone to find sex than friendship. That is why this is in the strictly platonic section. It is not that I do not like or want sex at all, but more that I want someone to talk over all our daily troubles and feel a personal connection with, much more.

Some of it is that my job just dominates my life, at this point ... but, I think part of the reason for that is because I don't really have much of a life to compete with work, anyway. I would like to, though!

I'm very upfront about things, I know some will be intimidated by my situation, but those who aren't will find a teddy-bear of a guy; a big, harry and loveable father with a great sense of humor who likes to have fun and adventure!
I'm financially embarrassed, which means I don't have money; yet, I'm self-sufficient and not looking for someone to take care of me! I'm creative when it comes to doing things, even with little or no money. I like to experience new things and broaden my horizons. I'm looking for friends, if anything develops out of that I'm more than ok with it. I have lots of time on my hands: I don't currently work due to a spine condition putting me out of my last job and divorce causing me to relocate. I'm still mobile, yet I have days where I move a bit slower. I enjoy things like music (country, older rock, pop, etc. . .), movies (especially comedies as I like to laugh), fishing, sports (Twins, Vikings. . .), other outdoor activities. . . I also like to go to Theatres, concerts, dinners, and other activities where I dress up, staying in (cooking, dancing by candle light, games. . .), and traveling.
I'm a person who will be honest and open. I believe in communication, in my opinion one of the biggest sources conflicts in any relationship is the lack of/poor communication! I'm willing to bend over backwards for a friend. I am seeking someone who doesn't mind that I will on occasion need a friend to talk to, and know that they can do the same. I also believe in apologizing when I do make a mistake and appreciate being told when I make one: although, I sometimes need to think about what I did, but I will always apologize. I am looking for someone who understands that if we get mad, laugh, hug, cry, etc. . .everything is going to be fine with us and we can still be friends and be there for one another! I want to be told honestly where I stand, even if it hurts.
If this sounds interesting to you, I would love to hear from you. I prefer texting to start, as I don't have internet and use Wi-Fi when I email. I live in Hinckley and would prefer someone that lives in the area or can come to the area as I can't afford to drive very far.
Thanks,

Teddy Bear Dad

I have an extra ticket to this event. A friend of mine needed to cancel, and I rather not waste a ticket, I have great seats to this event. So if you like the music from the Beatles, then this could be a fun evening. My treat.
So, if you are interested in having a fun time listening to music by the Beatles, let me know.

I am open to age and race.

If interested let me know, and put a Beatles song you like in the subject box.

I come to town quite often and I used to have an older friend that would come in the evening/night, sometimes get me a little loopy, then we would have amazing sex. He has since worked things out with his wife, so we don't get to play anymore. I would love to find someone like that again.

I am looking for mature guy that is in reasonably good shape (HWP) that would enjoy a full dress, fully shaved, sensualqnd very oral bottom CD.

I want someone at least my size, but bigger is definitely better. It feels more natural to bottom for someone bigger than me. I am not fem or submissive, but it still feels more comfortable with someone bigger.

I prefer older guys, but am open to guys around my age. Again, it feels more natural with someone older. Guys that are too much younger just don't feel right.

Last, I do prefer married but understand that poses its own obstacles. Not to be a home wrecker, but to trust discretion and health.

I am not fem, sissy, or twinky so if that's what you ate looking for, its not me. I am passable by looks, just can't act like a girl. I get very much into the whole sexperience, but can't be a full on chic.

Please send pics and stats in first reply. No face pics please, just body and dick. 7"" or bigger is perfect :)

If this all sounds like you, maybe we can mutually enjoy each other every week, or at least when I am here.

Hi, 

This is probably totally far-fetched and unreasonable but... I have hope.... 

I want a guy to text chat talk to, to just be random, wierd, have fun get to know and be totally honest with and vise versa. I'm sick of being lied to all the time by guys and well people in general. 

If anyone replies:

It was such an amazing day today and yesterday I went out for a walk in the downtown area but felt like a fool because I knew of nothing to do.

I moved here recently for work at the airport from Chicago so I guess I'm looking for people to meet and get to know. Preferably young like me around 24, white (preferably) I feel more comfortable. Who also has it together and either is in college or has a job they love.

There are tons of college activities, bars, parks, and events around me I just don't know what they are! Also have no friends here.

If you resonate with this post or are also new in the area respond to me. :) 

Within two emails or so if we click I'll send picture hopefully you do as well.

What is it???
What is it that a woman wants???

I have a Romantic side that will make most women swoon!!! Chivalry is alive and very important to me!!! I have written dozens and dozens of Romantic and Erotic poems, pouring my heart into them!!!! 

I will do anything for that woman who wants to become my best friend!!! I would move heaven and earth, to make her happy!!!! And I would make her feel like a princess!!!

I have spent several years studying and researching how to pleasure a woman sexually..... I know how to do things that woman CRAVE FOR, and men have have no clue about!!!!!..... I am very Dominate in the Bedroom, but treat her as an equal outside the Bedroom!!!
AND I LOVE TO CUDDLE!!!!

I would strongly encourage her to keep her independence, and be the biggest supporter for her goals, and yet still challenge her to reach higher and go for more!!!

I have a stable career and ith a good paying job. I have my own car and my own place.
I have worked hard to keeping the weight off...... Most guys 5-10 years younger than me are 30-50lbs heavier than me!!! It is very rare to find a guy my age, in as good as shape as I am!!!!
I can fix anything in a house and most common problems with a car.... I even enjoy going shopping and picking out the right outfit for a woman!!!!.... Know any other guy who can admit to that???
I am Very Well Endowed, and I know I am very attractive!!!! I can carry on an intelligent conversation and know when to shutup!!!!.... I was a stand-up comedian for several years, and a chef for a few more years than that!!!! And I always would give her the last bite of the last brownie!!!

I HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PASSION AND LOVE TO GIVE, and welcome any I get in return!!!

I have never wanted a ""Barbi"" or a model for a girlfriend...... Just someone who looks good in a little black dress and heels. Who takes care of themselves, but not a healthnut..... Just someone who is very comfortable with their body. Slim to curvy, 
But NOT OVER WEIGHT!!!
Someone who can keep up with me sexually AND can hold an intelligent conversation, yet knows when to be as goofy as hell!!

So why????
What is it about me, that I can not find and keep a woman of my choice?????

What is it a woman really wants????

This weather is drawing me to the great outdoors. I am seeking a companion/friend to explore Minnesota with.

I am looking to make female friends that are like-minded and share similar interest. I like to be UP doing projects, working, and socializing. I'm not looking for sex or for a date although most days I really could go either way as far as sex goes!

I'm open-minded, non-judge mental and I accept people for who they are. I'm college educated, articulate and determined. I am a divorce white female who has a job and kids. I'm 420 friendly and I enjoy spinning (I'm ok with whatever favors others engage in as well). I'm always up for new adventures and I live my life- I don't just sit on the sidelines watching it pass me by. 

So, if you're cool with all of this, and enjoy GOING fasT and being productive while being spun, and you are FEMALE looking to make new friends, I would like to get to know you. I assure you I am a real, down-to-earth woman who simply doesn't know where to find other tweak minded, productive, drama-free female friends. But, if you have any suggestions other than doing this on CL, feel free to let me know!

Thanks! I look forward to meeting you!

I'm looking for anyone who can offer kindness and compassion, through words and potentially actions, in hopes it will help me heal and learn to love myself again.

Looking for a friend, I suppose, whom I can message frequently and potentially meet.

My goals in this are:

Creating a supportive non judgemental friendship

Learning to live in the moment

living without the fear of missing out

exploring interests 

rediscovering the good in the world.

I AM NOT LOOKING FOR SEX! but I'm not opposed to providing productive physical comfort through touch. Ex: massage, cuddling, exploring the body excluding genitalia.

Individuals of any gender with open schedules and open minds are preferred as I tend to be spontaneous. Ideally you're based in St. Paul/S. Mpls. so it's easier for us to meet up and get moving. If you have a friendly dog, even better!

I am looking for someone to have a dialogue with, go for a walk, go to the movies, out to eat etc. I am a part time Philosophy student at the University of Minnesota.

Not wealthy but manage anyway. If you are interested more in the person than the picture I would like to hear from you.

I'll tell you a little bit about me.You already know what I look like and my age so that done. I enjoy music, walks and conversation. I like playing tricks and having fun with people I am around. Quiet moments and reflection on philosophical matters really interest me. I get along well with children. I love watching and have scores of documentaries from PBS and elsewhere about the brain, mind, politics, the 60s generation with its history and music, classical and jazz music, pets, academia, children playing, watching it rain, light hearted and deep conversation. There's more but for now. I believe I am an empathic, caring person. I believe in fairness, honesty and justice. These are traits I suppose a lot of people would embrace so maybe I am no different from anyone else. I hope that will help you decide what you want. I'll anxiously await your reply.

Business owner seeks another business owner for friendship and camaraderie. I have a great family and staff but find it's a bit lonely being in leadership position. As the business grows I find I'm not very good at stepping away and prioritizing non-business related activities so I lose perspective -- that there is a life outside of managing cash-flow and business deadlines. I have eclectic taste, varied interests, wry sense of humor, and a sympathetic ear. Drop a note with an expression of interest.

Hello,


I'm 24, female, and almost, kinda, not really married. I've been with my man for almost three years, and he has two boys. I'm a step mom, and didn't really plan on being thrown into this early in my life. I'm still learning.


I don't have many friends that I can hang out with, even though I claim to have many friends. Most of my friends are into clubbing and drinking all the time. I can do that every once in a while, but prefer a good friend on my back porch with a glass of wine or a beer any day. I work full time as the Assistant General Manager of a gas station/restaurant/ whiskey bar, so that keeps me pretty busy. 

I grew up fast so I'm told I am mature for my age. I hold manners and politeness in the highest regards and cannot stand rude or mean people. If you are good at being mean, please don't respond to this ad, we probably wouldn't make good friends. I have a completely open mind on many subjects, and I don't judge people for their decisions. I'm agnostic, but having religious friends would be great. Also, I'm bisexual, but as the almost husband has made clear, he doesn't want to share. So interests beyond friendship are going to be snuffed out quick. 

I love video games (mostly RPGs and table tops) and reading books,?sewing, learning to cook and bake, kids movies or cartoons, trying new wines (mostly Rieslings), going to the gym and being lazy at home, camping, thrift store shopping, attempting arts and crafts, and I love love LOVE coffee. 

I'm really just looking for a friend to hang out with, whether it be in or out. Someone fun and nice, who can have a great time without blowing their paycheck. Maybe if they were with someone we could double date. I just need someone to turn to, that I could call and chat with, or text funny pictures and share horribly corny jokes to keep smiles on both of our faces. 

I'm struggling right now with a serious case of anxiety and depression, but am getting help for it. Some days are just hard. Those are the days I need a friend the most. Even just a friendly text (I'm bad about instigating them) would make my day.? Hopefully new friends would be close. I live in Lakeville right off cedar and 160th.? 


OK? I've probably done enough rambling. I hope you are having a great day!

Please respond to this with email, and have the subject line as your favorite animal (mythical or otherwise ) so I know you are real.

Hi, I'm looking for friends to go to the movies with. I like comedies, drama, action, biopics & even chick flicks but keep that a secret lol. Too be honest I probably love popcorn & icees more than the actual movie. I must warn you... I have a slightly sarcastic sense of humor so it would be great if you could take a joke lbs. I enjoy doing other things too.

You are looking THAT guy, that guy that you always hope to meet, but never expect to really be out on CL....well, here I am.

About me: I am 35 years old, I am 6'2 and married. 

I am funny and witty with a personality that draws you in. I am great with a large group of people, but I make you feel special. I am always trying new things and learning and wanting to share them. I love to cook and travel and listen to music and read, but I also love being active and fit and one with nature.

I love animals and kids and have a very open mind. I try not to judge people. I am a natural leader and take control of situations when someone needs to take control. I like to listen to people and hear their feelings and understand what is inside of them. Sometimes the best thing I can do is just listen and provide empathy and a hug if someone needs it.

Yes I am real and I live west of Minneapolis. I hope I get to find you, that woman that I hope always exists on CL. I don't know what you look like and I don't know how old you are, but when we find each other, we will know.

I will happily send you a picture if you send me one of you.

To be completely clear, I am not at all interested in sex, and am happy to work with whatever level of modesty (or lack thereof) you're most comfortable with.

Ten Email Challenge

This is probably a bad idea. That's probably why I'm doing it.

I've become kind of obsessed with CL. I regularly check the missed connections after I've gone out hoping someone will have seen me and wanted to know more. It hasn't happened yet, and I don't expect it to happen anything! LOL!

I'm currently obsessed my job, and am so needing a vacation soon! I'm kinda falling for woman who are endearing, nice, and a little older, but I am not picky! You know what they say beggars cannot be picky!!!! I guess that's kinda my thing, although I'm not specific on what I think?

Anyway, here's my challenge: 10 email exchanges between us, anything goes as far as kind of conversation, and after that maybe we meet up. Maybe we just start texting. Or, maybe we never talk again and have a neat story in our back pockets for parties. I'm down for friends, but am not against more than that.

I am not a total nerd and completely obsessed with organization. I don't like like to wear lipstick.LOL,!!! I don't write shitty poetry. I've recently started drinking lotsa of coffee. 

If I sound even mildly intriguing, try out my challenge. Change the email title to ""10 Emails"" so I can be mildly convinced your a real person.

One of the best parts of the Dark Souls franchise is finding all sorts of secrets and sharing them with someone else.

I am having a rather boring and ho hum day. I am hoping to find someone to help make things a bit more tolerable. I am very open-minded, easygoing and laid back. Looking for conversation/ chats from rated G to rated XXX. I am an older gentleman but definitely do not look or act my age. That doesn't mean I am immature, that just means I never read the book on how someone my age is supposed to act. so comma if you have issues with age, move on to the next post. Also, I do not and will not join, register or verify on any of those bogus pay sites. I am for real, legit and on the up-and-up. I am not looking to meet, but should we find that spark and our connection, a possible meet and greet might be doable. I guess we can cross that bridge if and when we ever get to it. I will let you know, I can be very playful and flirtatious with the right person. If you would like to do a pic exchange, that's a possibility also. First and foremost, I am looking for someone to chat with on any and all topics and hopefully it will be long-term and not just a few messages and then you disappear. If I piqued anyone's interest and you are looking for the same thing, hopefully I'll hear from you. To weed out the Craigslist fakes, bots and scammers, in the subject line please put ""Here to Chat"". If I do not see that in the subject line, I will delete without even opening the message. So now I will wait and hopefully hear from some legit ladies out there. Thanks for taking time to read my post.

I enjoy non-mainstream dining and neighborhood coffee shops, the city lakes, the sights and sounds of the city, all types of art, holding hands, great communication, being close and making a woman feel special! I love the idea of a secret special friendship. No pressure let's start out as friends and let things unfold naturally. Send me a note... I think that you'll be pleasantly surprised!

I am a 30 year old, married, mom of a very loving 5 year old boy. I seem to spend so much time with my son that I just don't get much of a chance to get out and meet new people. All the friends I had through school have either grown apart, moved away or got caught up with stuff I don't want to be a part of or around my family. I am looking for someone that I could email or text with and become friends and possibly hang out and go do some fun things with. I am looking for some people to text, or email with to help pass the time. My husband works really long hours so I don't get much of the adult interaction anymore since I am a stay at home mom. I do not smoke and am not 420 friendly in any way. If you are also looking for someone to talk to please message me and we could communicate over email, or possibly text.

I also don't do any drugs, not even 420. I like spa days, tea and have been known to have tea parties lol, cooking/baking, happy hour, groupons etc, organic stuff, Netflix. Fun things I've done in the past: I fenced foil/sabre for a very short while. I've ziplined and skydived. I love roller coasters, animals, thrift stores as well as nice shops. I love berry picking in the summertime. Cirque du Soleil. Plants and flowers/gardening. I've always wanted to attend a Comic-Con and a MommyCon.

Good Evening!

It has been a great weekend with gorgeous weather and I am finally getting some time to relax, unwind and get ready for the week ahead. 

I'd really love to find someone to chat with and it would be even more fantastic if it was someone who was interested in a long term chatting ""relationship"". Maybe if we really hit it off we can even grab a drink? Maybe even a little flirting?

I am in my mid twenties, intelligent, outgoing and able to hold a conversation. I've been told I am attractive, am curvy but in shape and petite. 

Some of the things I enjoy include movies, cooking, hiking, camping, reading, gardening, new restaurants and road trips. 

My only requests are that you be between 28-38, at least hwp and have some things in common with myself. Pictures are a bonus but not a requirement. If you send one then I will send one with my reply.

Enjoy the rest of this gorgeous weekend!

I am looking for someone to pick me up from either my work in Fridley or if it happens to be a little later, from my place in Blaine. I do not drive and it a bit difficult to get there through bus. I'm hoping you enjoy the trivia game there and are willing to play a few rounds or so of this game. 

So, basically kind of like a platonic date type thing, where you pick me up preferably around noon from Fridley, we go to Dave and Busters to eat and play some games,then you drive me to Blaine afterwards.

I am 31 years old, a bit of a geek, curvey, blonde hair, glasses, crappy job, and just really wants to do this :-b. I'd like to exchange a couple emails so I feel comfortable with you. I am not picky, since it's platonic you can be married, single, whatever as long as you're straight forward with everything. But, I'd like you to tell me about you.

TL;DR: Married? Happy or not so much, open frank chats about most anything.

Hi, I started up a chat group and I'm looking for some active members. There is no specific time of day so you could be bored at work or watching TV after a long hard day.

This is a PLATONIC chat group about good times, bad times, and every thing in between but talk about sex is likely to occur here and there. This is not intended as a hookup place and as such is not just in your city.

The idea is to have a place for open and frank discussions about most any topic. If you are interested in some good chat and fun times then send me a note to get started. Ideally; tell me a little something about you, your situation, and what you are looking for in a group.

I'm posting in multiple locations so this isn't a one city deal.

But instead, lets focus on having some great conversations via the wonderful world of electronic communication. Witty banter, general complaining, deep thought, it doesn't matter. Who knows, maybe we will both find a great virtual friend though all of it.

Interested? How about we start it off with the tired old saying ""How are you doing?""

Hope you are having a great Tuesday!

I am looking for a positive female friend to hang out with at times....just a friend. To do things like, take walks, bike, festivals, movie, plays, museums, 4th July fireworks, sporting events, coffee and craft beer or drinks just to name a few things. Just to get out of the house at times. It could be for a long or short time, it doesn't matter. We can start off by chatting via email or text and see where it goes. I am educated, successful and a great conversationalist. I am divorced and have my kids every other weekend. You should live around the southwest metro. You should be around my age and I would also prefer that you are shorter and petite. If you are successful is a big plus because I am not buying all the time. Lol

Come on, take a chance and respond, what do you have to lose? ***Please put you height in the subject line of your response so I know you read this whole post and are real.***

I hope to hear from you soon!

I am looking for something pretty simple in my mind. I am looking for someone that I can chat with throughout the day. Someone to get to know, someone to help the time pass by with and someone to talk to about whatever crosses our minds. This is strictly a platonic friendship that I am looking for.

I am happily married and don't have any kids. My wife works quite a bit including days, nights and weekends and therefore we don't get to talk that much when we are apart. I work a typical Monday through Friday day job. That is why I am looking for a new friend. This can be strictly an email/text thing or maybe we meet for coffee one day. The key is fun conversations.

I have many interests that include board games, bourbon, hiking, camping, Lego's, movies, going to the gym, reading about new topics, playing with my dogs, craft beer, projects around the house and lots of others. I am 33 years old. 

You can be in a relationship or single as long as it's strictly platonic between us. Race doesn't matter. Age would probably be best between 28-40 so that we will have some things in common though it isn't mandatory. Mostly I am looking for someone who can articulate their thoughts, have fun, be open and willing to step out on a limb and get to know someone. If you think that might be you then send me a message and tell me a little bit about yourself.

I hope you have a great day!

Thanks for reading!

If anything in the subject line are things you like, miss, wish you had more of --well, that's a great start! 
So.... I thought I'd place an ad here on the CL platonics..... to see if I could find a woman to get a flow of daily or frequent talk, chit-chat and conversation going with...... maybe to fill some of what's missing in both our lives through fun and light-hearted e-mailing...... 

If you like to write, to e-mail, and have the time and privacy to,..... And also, if you enjoy and feel a smile coming on when you see something in your inbox, now that's what I am talking about. :)

Got a topic(s) you're already wanting to discuss? Let's hear it! Anything other than politics and religion are pretty much fair game --although sports isn't something I'm strong in. 

And oh, I also wanted to say that since this is e-mailing, I don't expect immediate replies! I get that work, life and family intervenes, and takes precedence --so take your time, and write when you've got the time to -- I will too :)

Now that spring is upon us, what a better way to spend a lazy Saturday than laying on a blanket with a gentle breeze, eating peanuts, and talking about how the clouds look like a variety of different things.

I am not your normal CL nutjob, just wanted someone to chat/email with on a regular basis. Have it a real person, hopefully you are. Let me know if you want to know more. I am 37, love to do anything outside. bummed about the rain this week...but its been a while since I have gone for a hike in the rain, I might do that this week(wonder if I could convince anyone to come with me) I can grill fairly well...but haven't quite mastered the ""cooking"" thing inside.

Most people will tell you how great they are, not me. I'm not great.

I've run into people who tell me that they are ""has beens."" I'm a never was, and will likely never be. Maybe next time around.

My life consists of the same stuff over and over, like a less interesting, no action, version of Groundhog Day, the movie. I'm comfortable with that, because I've had a lot of uncertainty in my life, and the routine is nice and comfortable.

I'll never try to impress you with who I know, how expensive my stuff is, or how great I am, because I'm comfortable with how I am, and that's all that counts.

Now I've posted a BUNCH of times here, and gotten no real interest, and that's just fine with me. I don't need, or want, awesome people in my life. Who the hell wants that, man. I'd have no idea how to handle that, since I'm so mediocre. It'd probably just confuse, or scare, me.

If you want to hang out and do some not so great things, and talk about boring stuff, send me a long boring reply. I have time to read long inane emails, because I don't do anything... EVER.

Send me a bland, no pose, no smile, no makeup, hair undone, full body picture, so I can be bemused by YOUR mediocrity. Wear something unrevealing and colorless, because that's how we roll.

Thanks,

In jest.

Hey there! I'm making this post in the hopes of finding someone to become good friends with. I've always been a huge supporter of the LGBT community. I know how hard it can be to find like minded people and good friends nowadays so I thought I might as well throw this out there.

I'm just about the biggest nerd on the planet. I'm hugely into PC gaming, Tabletop gaming, Anime, Cartoons, Comics, Magic the Gathering, Reading, Writing, Cooking. I have a wide range of hobbies. 

As for who I am. I've someone you can always talk to. I'm always the one willing to offer advice and listen to people's problems. I'm very caring and I try to be the best I can be for those I care about. If we become friends, you can count on that I will spoil you. xD

Just posting this to see what's out there. I'm a 28 year old bi guy who's looking for another guy to hang out with and do stuff together. I'm in a happy, committed relationship, so I am not looking for anything sexual, although cuddling would be okay. Also I don't need my feet rubbed and I definitely am not looking for an erotic massage, so if you're looking for that type of thing I've seen plenty of other postings like that lol.

To be honest, I've found it harder and harder to make friends th past few years. I'm 28, and a bigger guy, so you have to be okay with that. My interests include movies, doing stuff outdoors like going for walks, kayaking, camping... Some video gaming, drinking and trying new breweries and restaurants. I don't do drugs, however I do smoke weed once in a blue moon. 

I really just want to take it slow. Please be between the age of 25 and 33. If you think we might be compatible, shoot me an email.

Im gonna make this blunt and straightforward. (But please read whole post before passing judgment) 

I am a 36 year old married man. The flame has dwindled to near nothing. Along with that my self-esteem; self-confidence; and self-image have been severely damaged. 
So...I have a few questions I would like to be honestly answered.
1. Am I physically attractive? 
2. Do I have desirable attributes?
3. Would you consider me good friend material?
4. Thoughts on how to rekindle the flame in my marriage?

Obviously one would have to spend some time with me to properly answer these questions? So lets talk and figure something out.

While the thought of a discrete romantic encounter does intrigue me; that is not my goal here. I'm trying to avoid a full on ""mid life crisis""

I dont feel comfortable putting my picture in this post...so just ask for one.

Please put your favorite restaurant in subject line so I know your real.

Hi! I'm looking for a female to trade massages with on a regular basis. You don't have to have formal training (I don't) or experience (I do), just a willingness to try.

To those who keep flagging this ad - what part of THERAPEUTIC ONLY don't you understand? This is strictly non sexual as is required for this section.

I have a lot of trouble with my back, shoulder, and one leg, but can't afford to go to the professionals too often. That's why I'm offering to trade. To be completely clear, I am not at all interested in sex, and am happy to work with whatever level of modesty you're most comfortable with.

You must be clean (no drugs or diseases) like I am. Hope to hear from you soon.

I put the dis in disabled. I am still alive tho. I have no friends in the ""real world"". I am not able to get out. I spend all my time online. Guess I am ok with it, forgotten what a hug feels like but I fear it may feel different now. Perhaps it's delusional but i just want to feel needed and like time matters. I could be there for you anytime. A ""Good Morning"" from you would brighten my day. To know you are home safely would set me at ease. I'm not sure that it's unhealthy to have an online relationship if a real life relationship is not possible. It's just a little co-dependent maybe but with open eyes. I have nothing but time to devote to a friendship and to you.

You saw me hobbling and instantly knew it was my ACL that I ripped out. You also knew I did it skiing. I was impressed that you were so u intuitive:) and then...you casually mentioned you ripped out both knees twice skiing.

I was aghast since I don't know if I could do this whole ordeal a second time...

I told you I was going golfing in Phoenix but that I was so afraid that I was going get hurt again. You told me to suck it up and bring out the driver and whomp it lol.

I don't have many female friends but you gave me courage and I thank you for taking the time to candidly speak with me. 

I got a personal trainer at lifetime and I'm hitting balls almost everyday. I'm now able to cross train and lightly jog up and down the stairs (no longer one foot at a time!) 

Seriously. Thank you for telling me to ""quit being a baby and try to hurt myself since that means I'm trying to get back to living.""

I've started living again and I've started to have hope again. 

I hope I see you at the gym again since I do truly thank you for taking me aside and telling me it gets better if I let it.

Preferably you are in your 30s or early 40s, Enjoy the things I mentioned above, and are attractive. You don't need to be Tom Cruise or anything, but really, someone who most people would consider a pretty attractive person.

Hello, I am a 25 year old. I live out side of Monticello. I have lived in MN for almost 3 years. Haven't really meet anyone that I have become best friends with just work acquaintances. Remember your best friend from middle or high school, that's the kind of friendship I am looking for. 

I like to go shopping, get my nails done, anything girly, love being outside in the summer, 4wheeling, camping, and etc. Not sure what else to say but I'd love to hear from you.

I'd like my trainer to be between 55 and 65 and not terribly overweight. I'm open to any race, but I do need a picture first. Please just a face picture, all others will not be considered for the job.
I want this to start as a platonic relationship that could grow to be more.

I guess I have a relationship with my wife, but we really don't have a friendship anymore. She has her online and work friends that she talks to. As for me, I'd love to chat with women who are in a similar situation. I'd love to hear about your day, your ups and downs, how work has been, your innermost secrets and desires. I will share the same. I don't imagine we'll ever meet...we may not even know what each other looks like. I'm just looking for an online email(maybe texting or kik later) friend. Hope to get some feedback soon!

Once i get to know you I would share a pic. I am open to whatever you look like, age, race. Would be nice to some day meet up as friends but that is not necessary. I am real. Hit me up and lets talk. I am real, the Wolves just hired a new coach and Trump won New York.

Hi,

I'm a 27 year-old homebody who left behind the majority of my in-state friends when I quit my job last year. I'm a homemaker. My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant. Work was stressing me out. He got a promotion, and we made the decision that I could stay home and be a mom. One year later, no baby, fewer friends and I'm stuck talking to my dog all day. I say this because there is stigma attached to unemployment. 

If you're still reading, here are some things about me:
I watch too much television. My favorite food is tres leche cake. I read a lot of fantasy novels. I have an art degree I do not use. I stay up weird hours. I'm way too honest when people ask me questions. It can be endearing and annoying. 

I'd really like to meet some people in the area that want to hang out and get coffee. 

Email me if I haven't frightened you off with my over share.

Hello. I'm looking for a workout buddy - someone with the same goal as me: to lose weight. I'm an intelligent social introvert looking to get some extra encouragement.

I am a just turned 50 female who is active, loves walks, nature, and coffee shops.

Almost everything is better when done outside. :-)

I'm looking for someone who would enjoy doing those things, and other activities THEY enjoy. Please dont be a smoker - that's one thing I can't tolerate. I appreciate a good sense of humor, kindness, compassion and honesty. Family and friends are a big part of my life - hopefully yours as well.

Lately I've been thinking that I spend way too much time looking for sexual connections and masturbating. There is an excitement to doing this, and I think it can be addictive. Luckily, I can put this aside at work. I really don't think about it much there. I'm not always thinking about it, just too much in my opinion. I think of what a waste this is since it usually leads to nothing. There are so many better things that I could be doing with my time. On one hand, I have to give myself a break; I haven't had many good connections in the last several years. That has lead to a lot of frustration. On the other hand, I probably could be making better choices about meeting men (I like guys). I know that loneliness and shyness play a part in my predicament. However, I try to meet guys in different ways. I'm always keeping my eyes open at work, the gym, grocery store, etc. This hasn't been very successful. I find myself alone most of my free time. I'd really prefer to have a partner than hook up with random guys. I never thought that I'd be single so long. 

I did some research online about edging. Edging seems to have an effect on the brain like drug use. I'm sure it's fairly mild, but the brain can change over time. Jerking off for hours probably isn't the most healthy thing. I don't use drugs at all; I'm not even a drinker, but I edge a lot. Edging is bringing yourself close to orgasm and stopping then repeating. 

Most guys watch porn while they jerk off. I know that there are plenty of porn addicts out there, but porn has never meant much to me. I hardly ever view it. I don't like porn because it is a lot like prostitution. I have to think that some porn stars would rather be doing something else with their lives. I'm sure some guys enjoy that kind of work, but some have to really hate it. If you're watching porn, you probably are watching guys being victimized. That is a big turn off for me. Not to pass any judgment here if porn is your thing. I'm not perfect, of course. 

I decided to try to go without jerking off and cruising for sex (I didn't commit to stopping the cruising all together, but I really wanted to limit it drastically) for two weeks. I've been at this since Monday, and I would say I've done pretty good. I did spend about five minutes doing some online cruising, but I haven't jerked off at all. I have been spending up to several hours a day jerking/cruising, so I think that five minutes in about six days is a huge change. I'm feeling horny now, but nothing too bad. The temptation is there. I'm thinking that I probably won't meet up with anyone, but I didn't commit to that. I just feel that I'd like to know that I can go two weeks without an orgasm. I will forgive myself if I have a wet dream. :) 

Just thought that I'd write this to get my feelings down. Maybe see what type of response I might get from others. I'm definitely not trying to preach here. Anyone got any thoughts to share with me? Anyone out there relate to any of this? 

Have a great weekend, guys!

Update: My original ad was posted February 21, 2015. Things are better...less jerking off and cruising, but I'm feeling depressed. That never stopped me in the past, so I'd call that some progress. I had several responses to the ad, but no real connection for support. This is disappointing. I met one guy and chatted quite a bit, but he just disappeared. Nothing shocking. Unfortunately meeting like-minded people is not very easy. I know that sometimes it may be my fault; it's hard to give people the chance that they deserve. I get frustrated, and I may be quick to judge. Sorry if I offended anyone. I really try to be a good guy, but I know sometimes I fall a bit short of what I'd like.

Update 4-2016: Unfortunately things have not been going so well. Wasted a lot of time cruising, JO, and having guys play games with me. I find myself fantasizing about more ""out there"" fantasies. I realize that this probably is bad for me. More chances of getting hurt emotionally or physically. 

Thanks for checking this out.

        Hey girls I hope you don't think this is too weird but I love my brother and want good things for him. Here is the deal.  He has always thought about everybody elses happiness before his own.  He is 19 years younger than me and without a dad in my life it was always him that has been there for me.  He also helps my mom all the time and when the county was short on foster homes he opened his home to kids for many years. He is 39 and handsome and I know he wants someone special in his life but he just works to much and helps people too much and he needs to start thinking about himself.
He loves the outdoors, camping, 3 wheeling, snowmobiling and biking.  If you like biking maybe getting together that way and see how it goes.  He is thin-average and I know he would like a friend who is active and also takes good care of themselves.
I am posting the pic we got when he took me to the renaisance. Please write and tell me about yourself and send a pic.  He probably won't be too happy with me but will forgive me when he meets you.

I am working on losing weight so a workout buddy would be a nice bonus.  I am up for most any activity except for sky diving....oh and shopping.  No sky diving or shopping.

I'm Wayne. I just moved to MSP and am looking for more friends. Especially nerdy ones. Got a board games night? Add me. Cooking group? I'm in. Tabletop games? Sounds like fun. Wanna watch anime? Yeah, let's do that shit. I'll even dig out my old MTG decks if people want to play. Oh, and I'm garbage at super smash if you just need an extra body to kick around.

And yeah, I'm pretty aware that this is a shot in the dark. But hey, what's the harm, right?

Text or email is fine.
Hope to hear from you,

        Everybody seems to be looking for ""the one.""  If you are single,  you want to find Mr. Right.  If you are married you want that amazing affair with someone who understands you so much better than your spouse.

But how is that search working out for you?

It seems that there are many short flings here at CL.  You email intensely and it seems so wonderful ... only to have all fizzle when you actually meet ... or to find out that schedules just don't align.  

How about trying something totally different.  Isn't there a place between the all out love interest and the boring , everyday friend?  Couldn't there be a place where you connect in a deep way but it still allows you to have your other relationships  and go on with life without the all consuming nature of many romantic relationships.  

Maybe we could connect in a special way, but not make it an obsession.  Maybe we could meet periodically for  lunch, a walk at the lakes, a nighttime drink ... but not see it as ""the one"" relationship that fulfills every desire.

What if we were close ... confidants in a way ... able to share things with each other we don't talk with many others about.  But at the same time we may have other romantic interests, friends, or even ""the one.""  Life is about more than a single type of  friendship.  

A young woman can benefit from an older man in her life to care about her, support her, encourage her and share experiences.  An older gentleman can benefit from her youthful zeal.  This works because it is not meant to be the primary love interest of either. We are simply special friends sharing a unique and different type of relationship.  

I'm a youthful, insightful, caring gentleman that is very handsome for my 50 years.  I'm successful and highly intelligent with a wealth of life experience.  

Since attraction is a vital part of any relationship you need to be intelligent, insightful, able to carry a meaningful conversation and very physically fit.  Not a super model per se, but someone that is noticed when you enter a room.  You have no problem getting dates, but that is not what you are looking for here.  This is simply a special form of friendship where you can share in a way you don't with your husband or significant other.  

You are here at CL searching these posts ... something is missing in your life ... something is not working in the way that you are currently doing relationships.  Maybe this is the out of the box friendship that you need to set you on a different path.

        First and foremost I will say that this post and myself are truly genuine, sincere and legit. I am truly amazed that out of all the bots, fakes, scammers & pay site women posting on Craigslist, that there is not just one legit, sincere and genuine female wanting to chat. I am an older gentleman, but most people guess my age to be much, much younger. You are age and relationship status is not an issue for me. As long as you are not a minor and I am very non judgemental. I am very honest, loyal, trustworthy, laid back and open minded. Willing to talk about anything and everything, no subject taboo. Except for maybe politics and religion. I find them to be very boring subjects and I'm already bored. I'm not looking for a one or two time conversation either. I'm hoping to find someone interested enough in making it an ongoing chat friendship. My intention is not to meet anyone but, should we find that we have that spark and or connection to take it to another level, I would never say no to a meet and greet. I guess we could cross that bridge if and when we ever get to it. I'm just looking for someone to chat the day, nights and weekends away to make life more tolerable. My life has been all work and no play lately. So, if you are that needle in the haystack of bots, fakes and scammers, I hope you'll come forward and let the chatting begin.  To weed out those low lifes I mentioned earlier, in the subject line, please put...""Legit Lady"". If I do not see that in the subject line, I will delete the message without even opening it. If you care to send a photo to put a face with the words, that would be nice also. So now I'm going to wait and hopefully hear from the real genuine women.

Her and I are completely opposite of each other which makes it difficult to ever do anything together, plus her attitude kinda makes anything that should be fun not, it's really hard for me being a laid back, easy going guy that enjoys the simple things in life to be around someone so negative,crabby all the time and never just let's loose. Don't get me wrong, I love the girl and family we have created, and will work to make it. But it would be nice just to find a friend to talk to, maybe enjoys some similar activities I do. Which pretty much anything outdoors. Fishing, hunting, kayak,bike, hike ectopic.. just kinda want to escape and have fun. If this at all makes sense send me a message, let's chat.

        Some of us guys just need more affection than others. I think about touching and being touched a lot; usually several times a day. These fantasies are usually platonic; I can separate affection and sex needs. For some reason, I seem to need affection from men more than women. Maybe this is because of my same-sex attraction, but I don't know.

My parents almost never touched me when I was a kid. I didn't have affectionate friends either. When I was about 14, a boy in my class put his hand on my shoulder as he passed by me and said, ""hello"". It was an amazing experience for me. I had just discovered that I enjoy touch. I really hadn't even known what I was missing until then. I'm not sure how common my experience is.

I have done some research about touch, but there isn't much out there. I learned that children who aren't shown affection tend to either need a lot of it as adults, or they become adverse to it. The lack of touch can be very damaging to infants. Americans in general are somewhat affectionate, but there are places where showing affection is more common. Does anyone know of some good research?

I find day to day life really lacking when it comes to touch. I wish that people were more open to showing and receiving affection. I have to be careful with who I touch because some men are really uncomfortable with being touched. I take notice when a guy brushes against me. I have to wonder if he craves touch too. I will admit to subtly touching a guy like that many times. When I ride the bus, or I'm at a movie I wonder if I will be next to a guy that will let his leg touch mine. This is very stressful. If I allow my leg to touch his, will he quickly pull away? Will I make him uncomfortable, or will he appreciate the contact too? I'm sure that some guys hardly notice the touch; they neither like nor dislike it. If the guy seems to like the touch, I will move my leg up and down very slightly once or twice. If he does the same, it is great! If this causes him to pull away, I feel guilty for invading his space.

I studied massage therapy and worked in the field for a while. This became draining for me; I gave touch, but I rarely got any back. Not that I was expecting to be touched, I just didn't know that it would be so difficult to give and not get any touch back. It reminded me of how much I wanted to receive touch.

After I've interacted with a man several times (like at work, for example), sometimes I put my hand on his shoulder for moment. I hope that he will reciprocate later, but usually he doesn't. I never want to be pushy because I know that some guys are really uncomfortable with being touched.

I was with a guy from work last night at my place. We had good conversation, not just the usual superficial type. I felt a little lonely though because we had no physical contact. For me, good conversation with no physical contact can be lonely. I asked him if he was okay with hugging each other. He thought it was odd that I asked, but he was fine with it, and he gave me a nice hug. I think it's interesting that we have worked together for two years or so, and he never touched me until last night. We probably shook hands when we first met, but that was about it. When I was a teenager working my first job, several guys were very affectionate with me. As time goes on, it is harder and harder to find men like this.

People are very affectionate with pets; it seems that a lot of people would rather get affection needs met with a pet. I'm sure that many dogs get much more affection than I do! This is sad. Pets really do little for me. We had dogs when I was younger, but I never felt really close to them.

Sometimes I go for weeks with little affection. This really wears on me. I deal with depression, and I know that some touch would help. Affection is a great stress reliever too.

I was hoping to find some men that relate and share some thoughts with me. I'm very comfortable with meeting if there is a good connection. I hate texting, and emailing isn't much better. I'm good with talking on the phone at first, but I prefer meeting in person.

I'm a very nice guy, sensitive, down-to-earth, respectful, intelligent, very honest and introverted. I like meeting all kinds of nice people. Making new friends would be nice. I especially like real friends that don't mind helping each other (even working) when needed. However, I don't have a specific agenda. If you just want to talk about something, I'm open to that too. There doesn't have to be any physical attraction between us for us to be platonic friends, and I'm not going to refuse to meet someone just because I feel no physical attraction. If this is important to you, say so up front. Otherwise we may spend time together only for both of us to be frustrated later. I hug people that I'm not physically attracted, but it would be difficult to cuddle with someone that I wasn't physically attracted to. So, if you care, I'm 6-2, bearded, brown/gray hair, leaner than average, young-looking for my age, and handsome (your opinion may vary). I'm mostly attracted to guys around my age or younger. Again, it's more about the person inside than what's on the outside.

Keywords describing me, likes, etc: trustworthy, caring, fitness, floral design, atheist, respectful, long walks, deep conversation, hugs, personal growth, volunteerism, gardening, quietness, reflection, and lots more.

When responding, please include a pic and something about yourself. Also, let me know what you want. I will share a recent pic too. Also, change the subject line in the email. Yahoo emails end up getting grouped together by subject, and it can get very confusing.

One more thing. There are men on here that post ads, and they clearly aren't interested in platonic friends. Please help to clean these ads out. Open the ad and click on the ""prohibited"" link at the top. If several people do this, the ad is removed. 

Thanks. I hope to hear from you!

Biking, but no more than 35 miles a day and no faster than 13 mph average.
Hiking, the North Shore is beautiful. I'd even be willing to try camping.
I've always wanted to try cross country skiing.
I have a pair of kayaks.
I enjoy comedy clubs and outdoor concerts at Lake Harriet
I can't dance.
I like the Oldies and Country music.
I use to be an avid garage saler but no more. I love antiques/collectibles but trying to downsize.
I enjoy gardening and have lots of perennials. I love hostas.
I can bowl but I don't have a ball and the last time I was in a league was in high school. I do have bowling shoes.
Somewhat to get away in the winter with. Maybe a couple of weeks or a couple of months.

You:

Late 50's to early 60's. Active, trim and fit, financially secure, non smoker, light drinker, good sense of humor, slow to anger, honest, preferably tall and good looking and share some of my same interests. It would be great if you had a second home in Arizona or Florida or someplace warm in the winter but I'm probably dreaming. Today is sort of dreary and rainy. What would you plan on a day like this?

Tell me more about yourself. Send a current photo and I'll send one back. I'm looking for a companion but not marriage, at least no at this time.

        Once in a blue moon .... a perfect connection can happen.  I've been warned by a few who have gone before me that CL is an impossible place to actually meet a sane woman.  Yet, I consider myself sane and here I am.  

We all have our reasons.  I'm not looking for sex, thus I am posting on ""Strictly Platonic.""  But what I am hoping for is to meet a young woman who is responsible, intelligent and caring, with just enough craziness to be searching here for friendship. 

My requirements are high as should yours be.  You'll need to hold at least a bachelor's degree and be able to converse about numerous current events.  You will need to be fit as we will eventually go on long bike rides or run together.  You'll need to be available during weekday mornings and early afternoons for coffee dates.  You are probably married and not looking to change that, but you also want to find a soul mate.  You pass quite well as a typical affluent suburban woman, but you crave a more magical life.

If you desire the attention and stimulation of a fit, handsome and compassionate older gentleman ... you just may have found a match.

        I am looking for Married Woman who wants to talk about, vent, and Share with another Married Person.

Its nice to have someone else to talk to about stuff - especially the key things that hinder, weakened and yes kill marriages - Kids, Money, and Intimacy.  So if those things are missing or challenging in your marriage then definitely email me.  Also I would appreciate someone with an open-mind,
non-judgmental, and someone who realizes no one is perfect.  I have a lot of friends....but no one that would understand if I wanted to vent about my marriage. I am looking for someone whose situation is less than ideal when it comes to doing ""stuff""  and would like a fun woman in the same situation to hang out with. Also lets fool ourselves and think this could not become something...if two adults of the opposite sex are looking on Craigslist they want to do more than play tennis together platonically.  Be real.  

Also because this ad is in the platonic section, looks do not matter and I do not have a type.  In fact, I am not into body-shaming of any kind.  I have friends of different cultures so just because I am black male seeking a friend does not mean you need to be black.  In fact, I would prefer you would be someone of a different culture.

        I am a professional, educated white male.  I am seeking friends.  Ladies, let be up front and take sexy off the table.  I suffer from a really bad case of ED as a result of an accident I had many years ago.  It just doesn't work anymore, no matter what I have tried.

I am just seeking a true friend.  Someone I can do things with, go shopping, cook together, go to plays, sporting events, anything really.  I just get along better with women.  

Is anyone else looking for a friend?

        I think I might be crazy by even posting this, but what the hell, right?

I find myself with a rare, free evening tonight and am considering my options for entertainment.
I'd like to enjoy some company, but do not want to go into a bar alone where every guy will look me over up and down and grant me a score.  I really don't want to go eat a meal or see a movie by myself either.
I am 40s, petite, in shape, professional, educated, normal (except for posting on CL) and hate being bored.  I like witty conversation, good food, and light drink.  Not interested in smokers (ing) or a random hookup.  Not opposed to mutual attraction or healthy flirting.  Willing to pay my own tab.

So, what are we going to do tonight?

I also like taking pictures and it would be so fun to walk around with a new friend getting some cool shots.  Some of my pics have already been shared from other LTM meets.

Interested?   I do have work starting at 5 in Minneapolis, but the event rolls until 4, I think, so should be good there.  We can meet or drive together.  I know it's late notice, but slim chances are better than none.  I can help pay for gas or provide you with professional images of your truck as a thank you.  :)

        Hello,

Although I have run 7 marathons in my life, I don't consider myself much of a runner.  I don't like running and I only do it when I have a race to train for.  But, I know it's good for me and it keeps me young.  I am interested in running a 50 mile race on July 30, but I dread the thought of going out running by myself 3-4 times a week.  The boredom alone is too much.  

Is there anyone out there that would like to run with me?  Not every time, of course, but maybe once or twice a week?  I usually run near the U of M campus and down by the River Parkways.  Pace can vary, but I am looking for 8-10 minute miles.  And I prefer to run in the morning, but I don't have to.  

I am a simple, nice, and harmless guy.  I am 33, single, and I work hard at several different jobs while I pursue the precarious ambition of being a self-published author.  I am also an avid soccer player.    

Send me a note if you're at all interested.

        Ok so, craigslist may not be the ideal place but, we are looking for friends. Just friends. No sex or crazy stuff. Just guys, chicks or both to hang out with. We like to hang out around the fire, have a few drinks, maybe happy hour once in a while or even go do stuff. We like to have a few drinks and have a good time. No drama welcome. We are both sarcastic and can be a little on the offensive side. Dick and fart jokes are king. We like guns and archery and stuff like that. We like to smoke a brisket and bring out the buffet when we have others to enjoy it with us. If this sounds even remotely interesting, let me know!

        I live in South Minneapolis. I have a lot of book club friends, tons of gardening friends, and too many dog walking friends. I have no one who just wants to sit down and talk. Sit down and talk about literally anything. How shitty or good your day was, what your boyfriend or girlfriend or spouse did to piss you off this morning, or even how you cried because you saw a gif of when Michael, on The Office, came back for Dwight's wedding. If you didn't cry at that, I don't know that you have a soul, though.

Anyways, I live in South Minneapolis (walking distance from a Baker's Wife and Busters and Northbound and Pilgrimage and anything worth going to in this area!) and I want people near me who want to do stuff. Not do stuff on a schedule, but do stuff when we want to. 

About me: I'm talkative, friendly, and can get along with anyone. I say that because I am insanely liberal in my beliefs. I think everyone should do what makes them happy. I think everyone should have an equal chance at having the life they deserve. If you don't believe that? That's fine. We'll just talk about sports or how adorable Chris Pratt is or how much our coworkers are failures at life. 

I like biking, making music, writing, drinking coffee, eating food, working out so I can eat food, soccer (I'm going on my fifth year as a Dark Cloud if you know what that means...hopefully you have a life and don't.), listening to music (Neutral Milk Hotel, Front Bottoms, Smith Street Band, and Desaparecidos are my favorites), and watching awful TV shows. I have to say, I'm addicted to Grimm, and I was formally addicted to Glee and Hannibal. 

Umm. I'm fairly free-spirited, love almost everyone who is trying to be an asshole, and I like to bake things for friends.

Let's hang out? I'm free this Sunday.

        Hi. I'm young, in college, and I'm married.  Sometimes I just get stressed in my marriage, but feel I have no one to talk to about it due to my friends all being single and just not understanding the stress and at times loneliness.

        I have interests different than the ones most Minnesotans are into. I don't hunt or fish. While I like sports, my life doesn't revolve around them. While I love being in nature, I'm not the outdoorsy type.

I'm also not the hipster type that's common here. I don't drink or do drugs, so breweries, sitting on patios or anywhere drinking, 420, etc, are not my thing.

I am an artist, but not the flaky kind. I'm into nerdy things like Star Wars, Legend, Monty Python, etc, but I'm not a nerd stereotype. I love a wide variety of music, mainly of the classic hard rock type such as Zeppelin and Floyd, classical, funk, alternative rock, and a lot more. 

I generally don't like most pop and rap past the early 90s, and most country though. I like classic high brow literature and comics. Pretty much any decent form of art. It doesn't have to be high brow, but it's got to be more than frat boy or gross out humor, books like 50 Shades, and movies like the Notebook. 

I'm not religious and I don't like political extremism, whether it's the right or left wing. I'd like to find someone with similar interests and views as well. I'm all for being introduced to new things that are within the range of what I generally like, but there's no way you're going to convince me that Kanye or Tyler Perry are talented when they're not, or that killing animals for fun is a good idea.

In case it's not clear: 

I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WITH SIMILAR TASTES IN ALL THESE AREAS WHO CAN TELL ME IN THEIR RESPONSE WHAT SOME OF THEIR FAVORITES ARE THAT MATCH UP WITH THIS.

I'm getting tired of getting replies from women who either don't match up or can't tell me how they match up. I'm not a jerk, but I'm tired of this happening all the time.
