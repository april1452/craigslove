Anyone want to push the boundaries of the absurd and create worlds with words? How about spending mornings drawing together. We could make a movie. The possibilities are as expansive as our imaginations! I am just looking to expand my circle of friends and I would like to surround myself with creative people that I can bounce ideas off of and they can bounce ideas off of me. If you are interested, put ""I'm in!"" in the subject line. Any age works as long as you have an imagination. I am in my early 40's

You have given up before, yet you continue to dream, and sometimes have a look on CL. 
You know nothing is going to happen, no one is going to appear that will make you feel like you are not really different than all others. 
Perhaps you have or have had some physical issue (i.e. cancer, a broken something, etc., the potential list goes on endlessly) and/or spent time feeling so alone that even with therapy and perhaps an anti-depressant, the path seems solo in nature. 
It wasn't always this way for you. 
But when you think about it, and you have, you realize that you haven't always been the person that you are now.
And, that all of the years that passed, during which your goal was to make other people happy, did not make you happy. 
You have not been the only person on this earth to feel this way, to be wired in this way, to not be comfortable alone or surrounded by most others. 
But of course, some people like you find others. 
And, some never do. 
So, day after day, you get up, go through the routine you have in place...and then give some thought to the creative paths that seem to hold value for you: reading, writing, drawing, music...the list seems endless. 
Some days you create something, some days you don't. 
Some days you feel OK, and nothing seems to matter much. 
Some days you wish that perhaps when you go to sleep that night, you would not wake up, though only because of some higher power, nothing to do with your choices. 
So, what now? 
What if you simply find someone, and without looking for them to fix or change anything you are going through, share with them. 
What if you simply find someone, and without looking to fix them or change them in any way, allow them to share with you.
What if you put aside what you think you want, and the check list you normally use in looking for someone, and simply allow the exchange to happen without any diminishing feelings in any direction. 
What if you do this online until your perception changes, fear subsides, or until the exchange is uncomfortable and you get to stop without fear.
What if you choose to share yourself and your thoughts, ideas, writing, drawing, music, etc., without many questions being written in either direction. 
What if you realize that without the effort, you are likely to be alone forever, mentally anyway. 
Which, of course, may be fine. 
But what if life can be more interesting when someone is found that accepts the person we really are inside.
But what if life can often be more interesting when we find someone different than we are, and learn to accept them with the interesting, unharmful, and unique values that they have inside them, if they do have them.
You may have noticed, that the question marks that are patterned to follow ""what if"" in a sentence are not present.
Perhaps removing the question marks, in the way we share, is the best way to share. 
Write or wrong. (No misspelling...) It's your choice to do what you choose to do. Be comfortable. Make choices. And realize that there is a value in not simply walking into the closet in which you were born, and shutting the door behind you. 
This was not written for many to understand. 
But if you do understand, you are not alone, regardless of what you decide. 
Enjoy the day. Write if you like. Don't if you don't.

Are you wired differently? 

Your thoughts are not the same as most people around you? 

You have dated, perhaps been married, but after a while, you find that you are no longer happy. 

A voracious reader? Perhaps a consistent writer? Undoubtedly an unstoppable thinker? 

Yet, over and over, you find yourself alone, wondering what exactly is different about you?

If you would like to share your thoughts, I would like to read them and share mine.

I don't think I am alone in this perception, but finding those who share the experience is often difficult.

Perhaps it is for you too...

Okay, okay, okay...

I know that no one wants to read this, but I will write it anyway.

I can't take it. I want it to change!

Some women write interestingly for a short time, then the boring, questionable, patterned words begin. Start one way, then continue another. Put forth practiced introductory thoughts and ideas, then switch to routine daily thoughts and ideas, which rarely change over time. Respond emotionally to the thoughts and ideas you read, but don't put forth any of your own.

Why not, I ask? Don't you really have any thoughts and ideas that are yours personally?

Just alone at the moment and bored? Never had a relationship that involved any type of non-physical exchanges? Never have seen value in reading, writing, exchanging? Never exchanged without judging first, as you put no value into the desire to express anything of significance anyway? 

So you are not looking for any type of change in the way you live? You are not looking for anything less than the pattern you were taught to follow? And, this has made you so happy up until this point, that you want to continue the approach? 

Oh, I get it. I am so sorry! You know that I am only kidding! I want you to continue to be happy with your past and its repetition into your future. I'll quit writing that other silly stuff!

So, tell me again all the troubling things that you experienced today. Oh yes, then tell me that you hope things will go better tomorrow. Tell me about your troubling past in which no changes were thought of or attempted. Tell me about your old husband/boyfriend, you know, the terrible guy who didn't treat you like you deserve to be treated. Tell me how you want to meet a guy who will take care of you, and put your life back on its track to be repeated once again. 

I guess, finding that codependent man with only a physical interest in you will make it work out better for you during this round of repetition? Won't it? 

So write to me, and explain to me how getting your next relationship going and over quickly is going to finally make you happy. 

What? You don't believe me? What is it that you have the desire to share that would allow me to have a vision of what you do believe? Hmmm? Laugh, I will now shake my head and smile. Maybe you will too?

You might say that I am looking to regain the ignorance of youth that I have lost. The ignorance that once burned brightly, but that time and experience has seemed to all but extinguish. 

Perhaps we are all just creatures of habit, and once habits are set, we are more interchangeable than I would like to believe. 

Repeating the same actions and expecting the same results would be one thing, but I tend to think that Freud was right... when you set out to write a new story by using the same plot and characters as the last ... well ...expecting it to turn out differently might not put your picture in the dictionary next to the word ""sane"", assuming you use a dictionary with pictures... 

I am looking for a woman who spends too much time stuck in her head, has enough history to want to live outside of it, and realizes the difference between patterns that make sure that the kids get fed and the bills get paid, and patterns that keep us questioning, learning, and listening. I think words and ideas are exciting, and belong in the same world as that of touch and kiss. 

If you choose to write, do so with intention, and then share. Keep in mind that what is shared holds more value than how it's written. Your ability to write is not as important as your ability to think. Simply write and share, without worry about being judged negatively. 

How would it feel to put thoughts and ideas into words and then share with someone who simply takes them in, smiles, and shares thoughts and ideas back? It's a great big world so make your mark, assuming you have a mark to make! You don't really have to spend your entire life alone inside your head, do you? 

What have you got to lose? And if you know the answer, simply share it and see how that feels. You may be surprised.

Do you want to have a party with the King of kings? His name is Jesus, yes I said Jesus. Everyone hates that name but it's only through that name that all will be saved. You can run away from that name but no other name can save you. At the mention of this name even satan will bow down, no-wonder many don't like it. If you don't like the name there is a demon living in you. We are in the last days and there is an outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Signs and wonders are about to become normal. Do you want more of God's glory, his power, miracles? People are tired of church because there is no power there anymore but only good old story telling. We need to hear deep things of kingdom not what we have heard over and over. His revelation is progressive not a dormant one. Things are about to get tough in the world and only those that know their God will be able to overcome. If you want more God hit reply for more info on our meetings.

Thanks.

Things are getting worse here in United States. People are becoming lovers of themselves, having form of godliness. Depression, anger, divorce, madness and any other sort of evil that we never expected to see soon. You can't even trust your neighbor, family, friends anymore!!! Where is God in the midst of this? does he really care or exist? why does he allow all this if he is all powerful God???? Well, there are evil forces that we can't see with the physical eyes doing most of this. We are serious Christian women group that meet together once a month, to learn very critical things that need to be addressed. We want God for ourselves,Worship Him in the Spirit and in truth. In our meetings we have seen many people healed from different sickness, delivered from demons, depression...etc. If you really want to meet God and hear from Him, this is the right place. We love to worship God and soak ourselves in His presence. I am excited to hear people that are disparate for the move of God not games. Days are gone when they told us God did this and that, we want to see that happening in our present lives. Hit reply for more details.

God bless!

I would like to personally thank you for fucking up so much that society does nothing but think ill of us. MY FUCKING GOD!

Also I would like to let you ladies out there know that not all blk guys have multiple kids with multiple women. Or sit around all day and smoke weed. Or cant possibly have a genuine conversation!

So can anyone answer this question??? Is it truly impossible for two people of the opposite sex to be friends? Why must women seek out gay males for that? And why can't us men truly enjoy the art of the conversation with whoever? Let's be honest, if my wife saw me at a table, even at work with a complete hottie; being her friend would be completely unacceptable. On the flip side, for you women who say "" maybe she's not secure in herself"", if u saw your husband talking in the same scenario day in aand day out you would f-ing flip or at least question the situation until it stopped.

Yes, guys are the same . we'd also question the hell out of the reversed situation. The sad part is I used to have tons of friends both male and female. As life has moved on, those female friends have been replaced by more male friends. It just made it easier at home!!

So I pose this question: for those of you even capable of being honest with yourself........ How would the ""friendship"" scenario I threw out there work in your world? Would you question your other halfs conversation time with her??? I know u would so I guess the real question is why?????

Why cant adult men and women (especially married ones) have a friendship??? Phone chats, coffee, workout stuff etc etc. You know, the same stuff I do with my male friends daily.

Hello there! 

Little about myself--
I'm 19 years old turning 20 by end of this month (March 31st). I'm 100% Asian-American.
I had some college experience and now working as an assistant teacher at a daycare.
I work full-time and most of my coworker is female and so is most of my friends. 
Although I rarely get to see my friends because they go to school outside of town. 

I really don't know how else to make new friends other than going to school or going to a bar (which I'm not legal anyway haha). 

I don't mind having friends who are girls but I thought I should make male friends around my area.

I'm very social, funny, outgoing, caring, and honest. I love to go out and explore twin cities, drink coffee, eat out, and watch movies.

I want someone who has humor, be my buddy to hang out whenever, not be too shy, preferably intelligent and around 20-30 years old. 

Please e-mail about yourself, what you do, your age, and if you want pic please send me a pic of yourself.

Thank you.

Hey y'all. Spring is on its way, and quickly.

Dealing with a lot lately, and much of it all at once. Trying to juggle multiple things and mutli-task. Something that I've never really quite mastered. I've lost a lot of confidence in myself as of late when it comes to women. I've had a lot of failed relationships and it's left me questioning my self-worth, and what I'm worth to someone else. I feel somewhat abandoned in life, and just want someone that has a caring and warm heart to talk to. I live a very unique life that seems to turn many away without giving it the ""old college try.""

I live and cope with Severe Depressive Disorder from both genetic inheritance, and from emotional abuse (bullying). I also cope with having Anxiety, and High Functioning Autism. That said, I feel pretty regressed emotionally. It leaves me feeling awkward and identifying as younger than I really am. For health reasons, I live what's called ""straight-edge"" meaning that I don't drink, smoke, or do drugs.

I just feel very alone and need someone that I can call a good friend; one that I can trust to be there, and never hurt, betray, or abandon me. 

Please be non-judgmental and open to alternative lifestyles, and perhaps someone ""kink-friendly"" or at least understanding that I wear diapers. I have a lifestyle that might not be ""friendly"" to some. Nothing illegal....just unique and often misunderstood, or misinterpreted. If curious, please ask for more information.

I am optimistic that spring is coming. My husband and I have a home in the northern St Paul suburbs with over an acre of land on a lake. I like to garden, my partner not so much, and so it falls to me to maintain the landscape. We have a service for the lawn but it is still a lot of work in the rest of the yard, especially now in the spring. We used to have a friend who lived in an apartment who would come over to help because he missed the chance to be outdoors and work with the soil but he moved out of state. So if you are living somewhere where you can't garden and would like to come out to relax and garden, we'd like to hear from you. Pruning, weeding, dividing, planting. Also opportunities to swim, canoe and fish while you are here. Half the garden is a woodland garden, the other half has more sun. Mainly have perennials. Would be open to giving you some space of your own if there is something in particular you would like to grow. Deer, however, can be an issue. We are in our very early 60's but are open to any age.

I practice believing I know nothing, more precisely. That doesn't mean I lack knowledge, or flick matches at my grey matter hoping to ignite a forest fire. I'm referring to the bigger picture, the larger questions we have in life, and my rejection of the human tendency to concoct bullshit explanations and believe them.

If that makes sense and you're intrigued and/or practice life similarly, call me. Wait, I jumped the gun, sorry.

You probably have a good idea already whether you and I are the elements for a blossoming friendship to be, but I should probably divulge more about myself, my interests, and what I'm looking for just in case ;).

I'm single, 37, and have no children. I have no skeletons in the closet; I don't even have a closet. I'm not interested in meeting married folks, unless you and your partner have a real trust and understanding with each other. I don't need any jealous husbands or wives looking to juice me (OJ). I'm tactfully honest, open, and forthcoming, and have no interest in meeting those who are deceptive, secretive, or even private to an unhealthy degree. Oh, and habitual naysayers should click their back buttons immediately and consider locking yourselves indoors for good. Think porn, lots of porn.

I'm truly looking for friendship first and foremost, and not partners, sexual or relationship-wise. I am not opposed to the possibilities nor will I deny any attraction, but it's not my intent. Don't mistake me, I fully appreciate and embrace my animalistic qualities, but I'm led by what's above my belt-line. I'm seeking female friendship for that very reason as most men are not, and I can't relate. And, at this juncture I could use more feminine perspective.

My first love is laughter. I find no greater pleasure than laughing with others to tears. My ideal death would be from a shortness of breath in the midst of an uncontrollable guttural laugh. Likewise, I'm a character and a comic at heart, and much of my creativity comes in comedic form. I love to make people laugh. I write comedy to entertain myself.

I appreciate many forms of art, but especially music and theater. I enjoy a full spectrum of musical tastes, like Metal, Opera, Electronic, Ambient, and plenty more. Jazz and the Blues generally make me cringe. I'm on a massive Power Metal kick at the moment. When driving alone, I crank it up and do my best to hit the high notes. 

Here are some other tidbits, rants, whatever you want to call them about myself to help paint the picture:

- While I love comedy, what I'm actually best at is generating ideas in general
- What I'm worst at is listening when I take no interest in the subject
- I'm a humanitarian at heart who regularly takes exception with humanity
- I'm somewhat of a loner since most of my friends moved far away to Facebook, and visiting would be costly
- For money, I'm a web application developer. I enjoy it enough, but I would happily torch my meal ticket if the internet died tomorrow. I know too much, and it's a fucking mess 
- Watching movies triggers a narcoleptic reaction in me, and I'm rarely interested. Personally, finding the diamonds in the rough soaks the life out of me and isn't worth the effort. My favorite movie is Kingpin and if you find that more laughable than the movie itself, watch it 100 more times
- I watch little television, but on occasion do find a series that's intriguing. The writers of Orphan Black stole the plot from my brain, I'm not sure how. . .
- I enjoy reading books that challenge me to expand. Recently, I've read or am reading World Wide Mind, Falling Into Grace, The Elegant Universe, and Meditations
- Religious I am not (surprise, surprise), and while I can't understand, I am not immediately intolerant of those who are. I know some incredibly altruistic religious folks
- Atheism, I am completely intolerant of
- If Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton are elected president, I'm going to become a thrill seeker and put myself at great, personal risk. Then again, I said the same thing over the possibilities of Bush, Obama, or Romney getting the nomination over the years. . .
- I enjoy the indoors and outdoors equally, typically doing indoors and being outdoors. I enjoy being physical and love to bike, hike, blade, skate, and much more. I just started getting into yoga again, and welcome the challenge
- I eat well, and enjoy quality, diverse cuisine. Now that McDonald's serves breakfast all day, I'm set. Well, occasionally I stray for sushi, curry, and Italian. And Thai. And Russian. I hate McDonald's.
- I enjoy drinking coffee, tea, and wine. I rarely drink alcohol to excess, but do have a drink or two occasionally

Ideally, I'm looking to get up and out of the house more often and meet interesting, new people. While I greatly appreciate the art of writing, I'm not really looking for pen pals. Certainly, text-based correspondence is to be expected in the beginning. I fully understand that you are a woman, replying to a man, on Craigslist.

Time to go play now, good day!

Hope you are having a great day! Being incarcerated isn't all bad, especially if I hear from you it would be a lot better! I am incarcerated at a minimum security prison in South Dakota and am looking for a pen pal with a positive attitude. 
I have always been self-employed, my interests (outside of work) revolve around my three children and riding motorcycles. I live the motorcycle lifestyle 24/7 (except when I got sent to jail LOL). . .I am not just a weekend warrior! My life is an open book, if you want to know ANYTHING about me just ask. Right now I'm just looking for a pen pal, but a relationship is definitely a possibility. Relationships take time and I have lots of that since my release date is Feb 2019. 
I have lead a very interesting life and if you contact me I promise you will find my (pre prison) life quite entertaining and will also find that I am a fun loving genuine guy. . .. . .most say I am a teddy bear (with tattoos LOL)
I am currently in South Dakota (where I spent most of my life), but I find the thought of relocating appealing so don't worry about where you are living. I'm looking at all my options and am very excited to get my life back on track and also look forward to hearing from you. This is my first time in jail and am very clear that I am not coming back and realize that I need to make changes in my life to assure that won't happen again.
So if any of this sounds interesting to you, send me a letter and make sure you address it exactly the way I have written it (including your return address with your full name) otherwise I won't receive it (another one of those ""jailhouse"" rules). Some other details about me: Height 5'9"", Weight 250, Eye: Brown, and Hair: Brown/Gray, muscular.
PS One more thing, I am open minded when it comes to age (over 21 please), race or body type but please just have a great sense of humor and a positive attitude! If you can include a photo with your letter I would appreciate that! I can forward a photo to you of me . . ...just ask!
I look forward to hearing from you!

Just like the title says, this girl is looking for some new/more friends!

About me: I am a 24-year-old working professional, who has a bachelor's degree in Communications. I moved to Minneapolis about a year ago for work and have since transitioned career paths and jobs. Because of that, I didn't have much of a chance to stay connected with my old co-workers. So that's why I'm here!

Any ladies in their 20's that would like to hang it sometime? We can grab coffee, go shopping, see a movie, take a walk around Lake Calhoun... Whatever you want! Let's just hang out :)

I am open to platonic male friends but please note I amrecently engaged and getting married this summer! Long story, short: I am not interested in anything other than friendship nor will I ever be.

I'm sane. I'm real - St. Patrick's Day is next weekend but let the festivities begin today, lol.

Please shoot me an email with a little bit about yourself, why you're using Craigslist, and ""Minneapolis Friends"" as the title (So I know you're real). I look forward to hearing from you!

First off I am attatched so I am seeking an attatched black woman who wants a friend's with benefits discreetly. Save your judgement but I don't get what I want at home. You may disagree but it's my situation.

I am younger, early 30s but I look pretty young. I consider myself very attractive. I am in shape and a clean bill of health. Recently tested, do not use drugs. If you smoke weed that is no issue for me.

I consider myself to be dominant and a bit of a freak in the bedroom. I like to take charge, be a little rough(hair pulling ads slapping,) and very verbal. So if you are a bit of a freak even better. I love giving oral too. The package is nice and the stamina is great.

I find black woman to be the most irresistible creatures on the planet. Black woman carry curves better than anyone else. 

If you are interested send me an email. I know , what a surprise another white boy wants a black woman. But I'm very different from the most . Very laid back, with a great sense of humor. I will enjoy talking to you as much as playing. Witty charismatic guy with a sense of humor. 

Tall athletic, devishly handsome if I say so myself 😜

Ladies, I am not looking to offend anyone here. I am just really trying to figure something out.

I am a married male and not looking for anything other than to talk. I truly hope one woman will take the time to talk.

So, here is my question. Last night my wife and I went out. We had dinner, some wine and a great time. On the way home she told me she wanted to try something different and asked me if I was open to it. I asked her what it was but said it was a surprise and asked me if I was open to trying. When we got home, she asked me to trust her. She asked me to take a shower and to completely shave all the hair off my body. All of it. I did as I was told. When I was done, she told me to put lotion on my body. I did this. She then called me into the bedroom. When I got it there I noticed a bra, panty and garter belt set with nylons and heels on the floor. She helped me put it all on. I was intrigued as to where this was going. So I put it all on. When I was done, she called me into the bathroom. She told me to sit on her bench. I did that and she proceeded to put makeup on me. When she was done, she said there was one thing missing. She then put a really long blond wig on me. 

She took me to the living room and we shared a glass of wine. She then came over and started to kiss me. She told me she loved me dressed like that and loved being able to make love to her girly husband. We had a great time with normal sex. It was pretty amazing as she was really turned on. 

When it was over, she got up and got a bag out of the closet. It had pink panties and a pink teddy. She told me she wanted me to put it on. I crawled into bed and she snuggled with me all night. She said it felt sexy and she loved the way I look and felt.

My question to the open person out here is why did this turn her on? Are there other women out there like this? What is it about it that excites them or her? I am truly just trying to figure this out. Will anyone talk to me please?

Did you know that angels watch the us to know manifold wisdom of God? Ephesians 3:10 "" In same sense through our ministration of the gospel, we are spectacle to angels and to men (1Corinthians 4:9). Did you know, angels long to look into all this mysteries of God through the church if we are aligned to our calling? 1 Peter 1:12. It's an amazing thing to know how much God loves us to a point that even angels that live with him in heaven long for the relationship we have with God.
We are created in the Image and likeness of God, meaning, there are a lot of things that we share with our heavenly father. Angels don't iunderstand the mystery of salvation because they can't be saved. When Lucifer and his angels rebelled, God didn't send Jesus to die on the cross for their sins. Why? Only his children, created in His image can be redeemed. Wow, if only we could grasp how wide, long, high and deep is the love of Christ: Ephesians 3:18.

Things are getting worse here in United States. People are becoming lovers of themselves, having form of godliness. Depression, anger, divorce, madness and any other sort of evil that we never expected to see soon. You can't even trust your neighbor, family, friends anymore!!! Where is God in the midst of this? does he really care or exist? why does he allow all this if he is all powerful God???? Well, there are evil forces that we can't see with the physical eyes doing most of this. We are serious Christian women group that meet together once a month, to learn very critical things that need to be addressed. We want God for ourselves,Worship Him in the Spirit and in truth. In our meetings we have seen many people healed from different sickness, delivered from demons, depression...etc. If you really want to meet God and hear from Him, this is the right place. We love to worship God and soak ourselves in His presence. I am excited to hear people that are disparate for the move of God not games. Days are gone when they told us God did this and that, we want to see that happening in our present lives. Hit reply for more details.

God bless!

I'm a 24 (25 in a few weeks), single, straight, fun person. 
I often find myself home alone with nothing to do so I'm looking for some new friends to change that. Maybe a best friend can come out of this??? I have a five year old son so it'd be awesome if you had kids as well but if you don't that's fine too. He is with his dad two days a week and one weekend a month so those are the days I'm often at home with nothing to do. I like going to happy hour, I'm attempting to lose weight so gym and fitness are big at the moment, going downtown, concerts, festivals, shopping, nails, victorias secret, camping, traveling, movies, and just about anything else. I'm very spontaneous and adventurous! I'm a young professional with my own house, career and car. 

I find it easiest to add you on Facebook but of you're uncomfortable with that we can chat/meet first. 😊

Hope to hear from you!!!

I am seeking a single female friend who bucks every Twin Cities trend and adheres to none of the countless negative stereotypes associated with women in Minneapolis/St. Paul. It would be great to meet someone with something on her mind besides her job, materialism, Netflix, and ""hot guys"".

Hey there. I'm 34. Married. Kids. Dog. Job. House. All that fun stuff. I'll be running some errands tonight and thought if anyone was interested we could meet up for a drink or two. I LOVE talking to and meeting new people. Not looking for sex, hence the platonic posting. Just Looking to meet up with a fun gal for chatting is all. Married, attached, single. No matter. If interested let me know. We'll chat!

Walk with me a moment, will you? I'm married. Couple kids. Great job. Dog even. I look at my wife and I love her. Same with my kids. Even my dog. But Goddammit if I'm not bored right now. 
It's the same routine day and day out. Change it, you say. Spice your marriage up, why don't you? Been there, tried that. 
So here I am. Are there any other married women or attached women in the same bored boat as me? Let me hear from you. Let's chat. If we click, let's meet. Why not? Nothing sexual. Maybe a hearty make out session. Naaaaaah. Only kidding. Or am I?
I like to think I'm a fun guy in a rut. Help me bust out of my rut and I will do the same for you. 
I'm 34. Good looking. Modest. LoL. Sarcastic. Laid back. Competitive. Intelligent. 
I don't know what else to say. Hope I've said enough.

It will probably be Friday evening of the third weekend in April, but that is tentative at the moment.

Why not tell your fantasy to a man you will never meet? I am a very open minded male. I will never judge you no matter what you tell me. I am just very intrigued to find out what women fantasize about. Are you married and fantasize about cheating? Are you single and wanting to do something?

There is something about an affectionate, nurturing, spiritual human being who lights up the room and immediately makes you feel comfortable and is a very loving person toward others. This is somebody who is non-judgmental and who tries to find what's beautiful and unique in everyone they meet and certainly doesn't consider herself better than anybody else!! A touch of humor & wit, varied life experience, wisdom, sharing, intellect, able to truly connect, oh such important traits to offer others who also want a fulfilling life. Does this describe you? Well it does describe me, and if you would like to meet for a cocktail and find out more about these connections, and have a truly great experience that is both spontaneous and risk taking, send me your real photo and tell me a little bit about yourself. I'm a lesbian. I'm not interested in meeting couples and I'm not interested in meeting men, not even interested in meeting you if you have a boyfriend or husband ok? SorryÂ 

You can be in a place of struggle right now perhaps need a listening ear because you are heartbroken, or perhaps a safe place to vent, or you can be incredibly happy wanting to spread that around and make new friends. Either way, I will accept you and enjoy your company. If you are a person who likes to read personal ads but generally doesn't reply, perhaps you want to do that this time? LOL **smile** I have started up a gathering of single lesbians who really need and want nurturing support and friendship and just to go out and socialize and laugh together and connect. Please be between ages 40 and 55. This is a group of middle-aged women who have had relationships that last more than 6 months or a year.

I will return my photo AFTER you send yours. I honestly don't care what you look like but how beautiful you are inside. I need the photo also to make sure I am not talking with a man posing to be a woman. Hey, it's out there - trust me.

I just like to know who I'm speaking to and who I would be looking for in public - so it doesn't feel awkward. Myself, I am attractive, mid forties, feminine and in pretty good shape. I'm near the U of M area & I am an excellent matchmaker. Even though the premise of the group is not to be set up or hook up for the night, you just never know where you're going to find chemistry. Thanks

Hello everyone!

I am a single 29 year old male that is just kind of on the hunt for new and fun things to do in the next few months. I have been dealing with a very real recent bout of depression and I just want to meet new a fun people that I can hang out with regularly. Being almost 29 most of my old friends have all grown up and have got married or have families so I kind of got kicked back to the end of the line (which is totally cool just feels like ""well, shit"").

anyways, im a huge gamer, huge comic nerd, huge sci fi nerd, and... well...huge nerd in general. though I may not always look it. that being said im totally a night owl and im looking for people to hang out with in the odd night hours (im talking like START hanging out after 10pm). That's just my ""primetime"" so I tend to get quite lonely at that point.

Oh I should probably state im a smoker, but will refrain around you if we do hangout and its a huge issue. 420 is cool, just not my thing, and drinking is always acceptable, just not heavily!

anyways, we can email a bit and move to text and then see if we are cool enough to hang out, if you want. I am only looking for friends, and I will tell you why in the very first email if you ask me! :-)

Thanks!

Hi there and thanks for checking out my ad!
I'll be a bit upfront and say this; I miss the back and forth that can occur between man and woman --miss the feeling of ""can't wait to hear from her"" and so on. If that is how you feel, and you're here on CL browsing, looking and wondering, -but not quite sure whom to write to, -if any at all, why not try me for an e-mail or two, and see how things go?
We can discuss work, your odd in-laws, hobbies, etc, or .....if we start feeling a more familiar connection brewing .....emotional things that we each pine for and miss at home --or simply nothing in particular...... I'll leave it at that for now. :) And yes.... I am married if you're wondering that too.
ps: I don't have any expectations of meeting, this is more about refilling the 'emotional well' for me.

Married WM, looking for friendship with a married woman. Not getting emotional or physical support at home and hoping someone can relate and want to commiserate.

I'm a 28 year old guy into tickling, looking for men who like to get tickled. No sexual stuff. Just harmless (merciless) tickle fun.

So, to be clear: this is serious tickling.

If you wanted to do this, you'd be tickled to the point that you can't stand it anymore. And then tickled a bit (okay, probably a lot) more.

You know the spots: Feet. Armpits. Ribs. Hips. Yeah, all the usual spots. And yep, I'm totally serious. I have a ""thing"" (read: fetish) for tickling.

Again, there will be no sexual stuff, just tickling. 

Are you interested in laughing more than you've ever laughed before? Drop me a line and please include a recent face picture. I'll respond with mine.

I'm a divorced 40-year old male. I had been married for nearly two decades. I didn't date a lot before meeting my ex-wife. So the dating scene is new--and it's changed, or at least I'm at a different point in life. I'm a gentleman who treats women well. I like to go hiking and make a picnic or cook supper and watch a movie. I'm manly, but will write a woman poetry or paint her a picture. I'm a religious man. I also enjoy physical contact. 

Anyway, I don't feel I date very well. I'd appreciate a woman's insight on the dating process and what women like--what dating should look like.

Into sports watching, playing, talking about. Really would be cool to chat about someone that's into the ufc. I play a few video games. Camp, hike, walk, dogs. Down to have a beer in garage and watch a game. Very 420 friendly. Sarcastic rude sense of humor. Kinda socially awkward at times. It hard meeting new friends. I do have a Sutter which is hard meeting new people. The more I know you and the less I have to think the less I stutter. I do have a kid and a wife. I'm looking for friends only.

Hello people,

I just moved up here for my new job two weeks ago after I finished my military career instead of going back to VA. I don't know anything about this city, or well this region of the US at all. I have the pleasure of working nights half of the week so I sleep for a fair portion of the day.

I'm looking for anything male/female really for a non romantic relationship. Friends as people would call them. Anyone with a reasonable personality and can put a few complete sentences together I would definitely be willing to hang out with if they could show me some places to have a good time.

I do enjoy going to work out on my off days, but it usually ends up be really early in the morning, I have been reading quite a bit in my free time. Would go to the ocean all the time but not really an option here and would like some more options of stuff to do.

So send me a message with something interesting for a title if you will. Have a great day y'all.

I'm an attractive 37 yr old and would hope to find and attractive women around the same age. No one younger than 30 please. If you're still interested at all send a reply and hope for the best. Did mention sarcasm goes a long way too.

P.S. I'll be paying for both of the tickets. The only thing I ask for in return is good company.

My friends have been mostly failing me lately, so I thought I'd give this another go.
A few details, I'm 23, white, educated (have a bachelor's degree but back in school), reasonably nerdy, love music and movies. Also a pretty avid gamer, but I think that's because I don't have a ton going on in my life right now, meaning I have quite a bit of free time. Personality wise I'm mostly introverted; socially anxious, pretty shy, and overall just kind of awkward (although I've been told I'm not horrible). I've also been told I'm funny and ""nice"" but I don't know how accurate that is. I have been trying (and mostly failing) to be more social, so don't expect me to be a very forward person because I'm awful at that, hence turning to craigslist. I am single, but I'm not looking for a relationship but I'm also not actively avoiding them either. Also definitely not looking for a hook up or fwb type situation.
Again, just looking for new people to talk to and potentially end up meeting up with, with the simple hope of making some new friends. Don't care about things like age (within reason), body type, or race. Only thing I care about is that we share some interests and can communicate decently (so decent grammar would be appreciated). Would also probably be beneficial if you're not afraid to be a little more forward, because again, not exactly a strong suit of mine.
So if you think we might not hate each other, respond with a little bit about yourself and we can go from there. And if there is somewhere you want to start the conversation, I'm certainly open to suggestions.

Side note, also fine talking with other guys, but the M4M section doesn't exactly seem to live up to being ""strictly platonic,"" so I'll just avoiding posting there, although I'm guessing the M4W section is no better.

Hi, thank you for reading this posting. I am in my late 40's now and just starting therapy and uncovering this stuff. Victims tend to repress the memories quite deep. We know this happens (incest by a parent, uncle, fam. friend, older siblings, etc) much more than most people can imagine. If you were abused as a child you may very well suffer from degrees of this disorder. Do you feel uneasy a lot of the time? Like you don't 'fit in'? Sometimes conflicting sexual impulses? Sometimes display a behavior that makes you feel like it's an out-of-body episode? Seeking someone who would be interested in chatting a bit and compare notes. I am gaining a full grasp of this condition and recognize past triggers. What stage of awareness are you?

hi all,
So it's Friday night and I find myself off work early and without any plans whatsoever. I work full time and want to meet and get to know someone new outside of work. Looking for a friend but if we hit it off we can see where it goes. Let's talk, hangout, see if we click. A little about me: I'm adventurous, intelligent, into health and nutrition, like having funny conversations but also serious ones (occasionally the two coincide). 20 years old, half Asian half white, took a short break from being a student and currently work full time, I like music and going out to eat and trying new things and enjoying the outdoors and coffee. And about a hundred other things, but that's for you to find out. I'm 5'9 and in pretty good shape. Your picture gets mine. Drop me a line with a little bit about yourself and we'll go from there. Hoping to hangout with someone tonight. Thanks for reading!

Hail there :D

Just because it is Craigslist and some folks get confused by the meaning of ""Platonic."" I am by no means interested in the physicalities a man and woman may share. I am in a committed relationship of several years and have two beautiful children! :)

If you are still here great! That said what I am looking for is a sincere time spent with someone who can carry out intelligent, non-condemning, and easy flowing conversation. :)
Other than that I don't care your age as long as you are classified as an adult, as long as you have skin I don't care how much melanin it contains, how much you weigh has nothing to do with who you are as a person by my belief, and that is how I sit with everything associated with what the eyes perceive. Not a common held stance I know ;b

Here is the hook! I am free perhaps tonight, but that is kinda short notice, Saturday, and Sunday. I would like to talk to you a little bit, so that there can be greater comfortably for when we meet and greet, as well as a degree of chemistry. Aside from friendly banter and sharing, it would be my privilege to treat you to dinner, coffee/drinks, movie, walk/outdoor chill pun intended, or other ideas you may have. Why? Because I love people, and my partner is visit her parents as she often does a few hours away whose values are for starkly different from my non-negotiatable beliefs, and therefore interact with them as infrequently as possible. I am tired of spending the weekends alone and would just like a friend to get to know. :)

Still there, awesome! Finally, little about me. I am empathetic, compassionate, erudite, cerebral, open perspective, genuine, kind, respectful, adventurous, ambitious, well humored, spontaneous, and a rebel at heart! Let's talk, get to know each other a bit and make weekend plans! :D remember my treat ;b

Will send pic/s (decent) to replies that took some time to respond with more than a sentence. Thanks for reading :)

With excitement, 

ME

Hi there! I appreciate you taking the time to read this. Hopefully you have an interest in some of the same things I do. Spring seems to be coming on fast and strong. I would love to get out and mix it up with someone.

First things first. I am 5'8"" with short hair (some grey), about 165 pounds, glasses, and in decent shape. Actually I am on my way to being in very good shape. I look good in my bike shorts. While some may see me as average I am far from that in many ways... physical and beyond.

I am the primary care giver for my younger children. Effectively I am Mr. Mom. I would love to meet someone who might be in a similar situation for activities during the day. I can also get away in the evenings with a bit of notice.

I am more than willing to share my picture with anyone that responds with a legitimate response. Last year I tried this here on CL and met some amazing people. I have a wide variety of interests and hope to explore some of those with you soon.

I know that there are a ton of men on here scamming for sex or other things. While of course I am a sexual man that is not my main focus in trying to meet someone. I am lonely and have free time during the day. I just would like to be more active and see where things go. I have no expectations and hopefully you are open minded enough to give it a chance. My friends would describe me as super humorous and someone with a bit of wit and extremely easy going.

I have an advanced degree in music performance and can make a connection with just about anyone. If you are up for some conversation and harmless flirting ping me back. The only way to find out where it all may lead is to take that first step and message me back. I challenge you to take a peek down the rabbit hole. ;)

Hello

Life is too short to not have friends. Finding them is hard especially when you are older. I am looking to grow my male social network. It is also good for the spirit and for our health. 
I don't think CL is a cure all for this but it is worthy of a shot.
I am a 45 year old, gay guy (in a relationship) looking for other guys to hang out with. It does not matter if are married, partnered, single, straight, bi, gay or whatever. What matters is that your are cool, kind and genuine. It would be fun to go to to happy hours, going to games and concerts, hikes, biking exploring, sky diving, zip-lining, etc. I am up for most anything.
This is about hopefully making a strong connection and reinforcing it over time so that it blossoms into a friendship. If you need to know details up front like stats or whatever, I don't think this will work out. 

Heck yeah, it's nerve racking to meet a stranger, but you never know what can happen unless you take that chance, right? Join me and let's chat!

Drop me a line if you are interested and a little about you. Feel free to ask questions.

How do you do?

Nice to see people still read, bare with me as my spelling is horrible as well as my grammar, maybe you'll be able to understand?

The English language has roughly a million words and it takes 15 minutes to try and figure what word to use to start a sentence or for me it is at least, one of the downfalls of being a stoner.

Yep, I wasted another fifteen minutes, ahh.

We should have coffee as emailing and such is only seven percent affective when communicating, I went to a seminar, so you know I'm an expert now, lol.

So, here's the deal, I'm bad with making friends, my personality is less then stellar?

So, what I'm a smart ass and don't like things complicated.

In my early thirties, smoke cigarettes but not much of drinker, super classy, I'm aware.

Believe it or not, I help give back to the community and or society and do my fair share. (I litter )
I was kidding about the littering, btw.

Life is pretty good here, but always better to share what you have with those who are deserving.

It would be nice to spend a little less time alone, maybe you would be willing to tech me how to make a Friend or maybe you have a friend, kind of like me but not or after a Few cups of co co (or pick your poison within reason) you my want to be my friend?

let's go zip lining, I bet you will laugh at least once.

Perfuably your a sinner with some type of principle system, as I am looking for a friend and friends are for life, even if you move. Lol

This is taking significantly longer to write, than anticipated but figure it's worth the extra effort being that your reading it, :) I will be happy to repspond to those worth responding to with a picture of myself.

Enjoy the weekend, 

Bob

Did not come; I failed... going to try and keep this short as my goal is simple. I long for someone who realizes we are all human from differing walks of life to talk to. 

The other night I failed to die. Life has been rough, and though I have made it through everything I have edured, I made for my escape. My body fought through the pills and I am still alive for likely many reasons, one of which I hope is to connect with a someone as friends to be able to conversate with, share, listen, vent, and be supporting to as we go through life.

Some qualities that surmise who I am are: empathetic, kind, passionate, compassionate, erudite, honest, supportive, humorious, cerebral, communicative, sensitive to others, but broken... 

So yeah, need a friend that will be actually that in the most true way, then reply with whatever you like. I will respond and yes, with decent pictures so that you can know who you are talking to.

Thanks :)

First and foremost I will say that this post and myself are truly genuine, sincere and legit. I am truly amazed that out of all the bots, fakes, scammers & pay site women posting on Craigslist, that there is not just one legit, sincere and genuine female wanting to chat. I am an older gentleman, but most people guess my age to be much, much younger. You are age and relationship status is not an issue for me. As long as you are not a minor and I am very non judgemental. I am very honest, loyal, trustworthy, laid back and open minded. Willing to talk about anything and everything, no subject taboo. Except for maybe politics and religion. I find them to be very boring subjects and I'm already bored. I'm not looking for a one or two time conversation either. I'm hoping to find someone interested enough in making it an ongoing chat friendship. My intention is not to meet anyone but, should we find that we have that spark and or connection to take it to another level, I would never say no to a meet and greet. I guess we could cross that bridge if and when we ever get to it. I'm just looking for someone to chat the day, nights and weekends away to make life more tolerable. My life has been all work and no play lately. So, if you are that needle in the haystack of bots, fakes and scammers, I hope you'll come forward and let the chatting begin. To weed out those low lifes I mentioned earlier, in the subject line, please put...""Legit Lady"". If I do not see that in the subject line, I will delete the message without even opening it. If you care to send a photo to put a face with the words, that would be nice also. So now I'm going to wait and hopefully hear from the real genuine women.

I am looking for a WOMAN who loves to dance and is into everything from house music at First Avenue, to everyday Good music at the Front Bar in SE weekends to Hipshaker soul music DJs in Mpls & St Paul monthly. It would be Extra incredible if you are in a relationship or marriage where ""he"" does not dance and you miss dancing or you are tired of going alone (or just with your girls). I am Very Open to race and prefer Woman outside of my race.

Yes, I am real. It is Saturday and snow is predicted tomorrow. I am Discreet, African-American male, 
5 ft 7, 185lbs fun to be around, healthy, love to dance, nicelooking, open-minded, non-judgmental, and I am VERY OPEN to race and women's body types (thin, average, to chubby/curvy). 

I do not need a face pic. Feel free to read this Ad and read between the lines as well. :-)

If dancing is not your thing, please do not write. I am also not expecting you and I to go out dancing and be up on each other all night long...im open to dancing, dancing with others at the event and leaving out together even if we come seperately. Also I am not a jealous-guy, I have no problem with some nights you leave out with me and other nights you leave out with someone else or no one else.

Put ""Your Lover/Dancer"" in the subject line and describe yourself and where you like to go dancing and if you have heard of Honey nightclub, Hipshaker events, Etc.

Conventional logic would dictate that I should have already found her. Unfortunately that's just not how real life works sometimes. If your reading this, you probably understand what I mean.

I'm an intelligent, educated professional. Physically, I could best be described as George Costanza.

I love to take walks, linger in coffee shops & watch comedies. My kids are my favorite people and my first priority in my life. Really, I'm looking for someone in the same situation. Married, but not fulfilled. But there's just too much at stake to leave. I want a best friend, and to be very honest, I'd like a lover. I don't know if there's anyone on here who genuinely wants to find someone to love, but only in our own secret world. A small crack in the universe where illusion & reality meet. If you are here, you would be married & not willing or able to change that. You would be between 30 & 50 years old. Your race is not important to me (I'm white, if it matters to you,) BBW are welcome, I love curves. But no SSBBW, just a personal preference. 

Please write, I am anxious to make someone smile and laugh again.

Hi guys-

I am looking for an intelligent, mature but somewhat younger guy who is interested in a deeper friendship with some physical touch, but still platonic. It's the kind of relationship a lot of men want, but are afraid to have. I am seeking a man who is smart, but very down to earth, with varied interests, who would want to hang out and strive for a deeper friendship without fear of hugs or nonsexual signs of deep affection-thanks. I know you're our there!

I am looking for a workout partner. I have been athletic my entire life so I know my way around a gym. I am friendly, very strong, intelligent and make a good friend. I have done everything from hockey to ironmans to yoga to martial arts.

I don't really care how old you are. I do care that you are an experienced gym goer or athlete. That means you are probably within 20 lbs of your ideal weight and run more than a mile or at least know proper form in most weight exercises.

I dont care how tall you are or what you do professionally. I dont care of you are rich or poor. I just want a workout buddy. If we end meeting for coffee before a run or having a post workout recovery meal, I am game. I am single but am having horrible luck in the dating arena and am giving up (at least for awhile).

I workout at the ywca in uptown, but am not opposed to changing gyms if we decide we want to workout togetehr for a longer term. I have had my membership for 14 years now, so it is unlikely I am going to change gyms because we workout one or three times. I am sure your gym has guest passes just as mine does, and we could both join snap as a cheap alternative for awhile. 

Please, dont be a religious or political zealot. That really bugs me. I suppose it would be nice if you were above 25 yrs old, and probably late twenties would be a better start. I guess I would prefer it if you were at least 32.

Hey there!

My husband and I have recently come to the conclusion we have very few couple friends we can go out with!! We like to do spur of the moment going out type deals. 

A little about us. I am 24 years old and my husband is 23. We both work full time jobs and go to school but like everyone, we need that weekend break to keep us going! We have one son. We like to go on dinner dates, movies, downtown to the club or bar, or even bars in our town. We love to drink & dance! 

What we are looking for are couples who are also looking for friends to hang out with and have a good time. Even if it's having a drink at the house. A few Girlfriends for myself would be nice but even better if my husband has a good friend out of the deal. 

This is strictly platonic. If you are interested send me an email with a little about you and change the subject line so we know you are real!

I remember life before marriage. Before children. I remember longing for one another constantly. Just holding one another all night and nothing else in the world seemed to matter. I remember loving one another with every ounce of our being. I remember lusting for one another (at minimum) daily. I remember staring in her eyes on our first date and knowing, without a doubt, I was staring into the futute. I remember passion. 
And then the first child came. And then the rings went on our fingers. And then life began. A life filled with love for one another and our children. A life we we had both dreamed of. A life we worked so hard to attain. A life filled with frustration. A life filled with exhaustion. A life devoid of sex. A life without the expression of that passion we once shared. 
I love my wife with all of my heart. I love my children with every ounce of my being. I look in their eyes and know, without a doubt, I see the future. I see graduations, and weddings, and grandchildren. I see a life worth living. A life worth being proud of. But I miss sex. I miss (the occasional) moments of irresponsibility with minimal consequences. I miss lust. I miss the passion.
I have no idea why I posted. I have no idea what my intentions or motives are. Maybe this resonates with you? Maybe you'd like to chat? I'm never opposed to making a new friend, and I love to learn about other people and hear their stories. I guess if you'd like to chat, drop me a note. I hope you're having an awesome day!

Well...the category said 'non sexual' ....so depends on your definition. Here goes.....

Sincere and nice WM seeks sensual and pretty woman (size, age open) to 1. enjoy coffee and conversation and discuss anything we might wish to...freely and without restrictions, 2. sometime during our coffee dates, when it feels right....we will show each other how nice we are and will masturbate for each others viewing and sensing pleasure. We will not touch each other at this juncture of our relationship and of course no sexual intercourse, oral, etc. Just talking....discussing.....some disrobing......and expressing our sexuality to an appreciative friend and admirer. Think of it as a huge improvement on what you do by yourself. And takes masturbation to an entirely different level. Much more satisfying and meaningful. And when you think about it....not so...selfish. Nothing wrong with being selfish....it is important to focus on your needs, but your needs can pleasure someone you grow to like and admire too....and that in turn gives you even more pleasure.

Middle aged, professional, very nice looking, tall, blue eyed, well educated, white. Safe and sound. Just looking for a very creative and sensual woman to explore our mutual inclinations WITH. What a way to....go? .....and cum too!

Hi there. Thanks for reading my ad, out of the probably thousands of these that are out there. 

In short, I'm looking for someone to chat with on a regular basis. I get somewhat bored at work from time to time, and today is one of those times. Not really interested in chatting with a ton of people, or talking for an hour or two then being done. I guess I'm looking for more of a pen pal kinda thing. Let's get to know each other, vent about our lives, and be actual friends (electronically), and chat about anything our hearts desire.

Sound like something you'd be interested in? Then what are you waiting for?! Email me, and type ""I'll talk to you!"" as the subject to weed out the plethora of spam emails that I will most certainly get. Also, pick our first topic of conversation. The most interesting ones will probably yield a quicker respond.

Hi there! My name is, Liz. I just recently turned 25 and live in Brooklyn Park. 
I got to the point the other day realizing...""enough is enough"" with my weight and I really want a friend who is in the same boat as me. 
I'm obese and am wanting to eventually drop 120 lbs. I have a genetic connective tissue disorder that makes working out hard to do all of the time, and because of that I have a very hard time staying motivated and I'm very shy and uncomfortable at gyms. 
I figured if I found someone who might be in the same boat as me it'd make it a lot easier to get into the swing of things. I have an LA Fitness membership. I work evenings mostly, so mornings would be best. 
I'm self conscious about my weight, so another reason why I'd rather have a woman who is in the same boat as me.
I'd be willing to meet at the Brooklyn Park or the Brooklyn Center LA Fitness. Must be understanding of the fact I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and certain things I literally physically cannot do. But am still willing to help you do if possible. 

I know this might sound a bit much, but again I'm really wanting to take my health back and work on this. I just need someone else who needs the same motivation as I do. 

I'm not too picky on age, but preferably my age or a little older.

Not looking for a hook up. Seeking advice on a place in Woodbury that I can go for secret rendezvous with my husband. He works in Woodbury but we don't live there. I'd like to surprise him on his long lunch breaks with a quickie occasionally. Not familiar with the area, so not sure where we could go to do this. Anyone in the area have any advice for me? Places to park? Maybe someone has private land with a secluded area that they are willing to let me park on? Anything else I haven't thought of? Hotels will get expensive, I was hoping to treat him with weekly visits. Thanks!

Yo, friendships are hard to keep track of and they change when you have kids and are married being a responsible adult and whatnot, so here I am on the blogoshpere up in your grill.

I'm happily married with two kids so no funny business unless it's the regular kind and not the adult kind.

So anyway, to business. Are you a human seeking another human to do stuff with? Like going to the mall with a grown man and his 2 toddlers? Building cool stuff or pretending to be an artist sometimes? Do you like anime, superheroes, tattoos, piercings, science, reading books in/not in the same room with other people? None of these things listed? Well then a friendship with yours truly may or may not be just for you!

So listing things is easier than trying to be humorous with everything.. Here goes.
Likes: Anime, Movies with depressing ending, building furniture, painting, drawing, drinking beers, karaoke, sincere/insincere conversations, judging people and feeling bad for being judgemental but doing it anyways, hand to hand combat, swordfighting, hiking kind of, hanging out with the family, being married, body modification, coffee.

Dislikes: Working on cars, slipping on ice, coffee that's too hot to drink, serial killers, romantic western novels, people who when asked what kind of music they like they say ""everything"", southern comfort, having always to be the one to call or text first, other stuff.

Don't know what else to say really, so. End

You are smart, intelligent, and proud. But you have your fantasies and desires -- you want to be vulnerable. You do not want to be violated and looked down upon in any way. You want to be guided with strict rules and fair demands. You want to feel desired, protected, and loved. You are extremely curious. 

I am smart, confident, and articulate. I am observant, a good listener, and patient. But I am stern, demanding, and ever pushing on your limits. I am fair and affectionate. I talk, I joke, I laugh -- I am human. I will guide, lead, protect, and care. 

We both have our lives, perfect as it may seem from the outside, but vanilla on the inside. We both crave for a little adventure, where we both will enjoy the journey. But we both are responsible adults and will know real life comes first. This is strictly online fantasy. I am not planning to meet. So, how does this work? Let's figure out. I am as curious as you are -- it is a game for the curious and intelligent minds.

Please put one of your favorite books in the subject line.

And then move to meeting when the time feels right. Do you want that kind of relationship back again? I do. So let's give it a try.

I am married, and it's fine if you are too. Basically, we're roommates, and I know for certain she's had some outside relationships. I can't really change things right now, so my thought is why not make someone happy, and find fulfillment and excitement outside, as long as nobody gets hurt? In the long run, it's better for everyone. So let's just have fun! There will be some sneaking around to communicate, but that's also part of the fun, right?

Some of us guys just need more affection than others. I think about touching and being touched a lot; usually several times a day. These fantasies are usually platonic; I can separate affection and sex needs. For some reason, I seem to need affection from men more than women. Maybe this is because of my same-sex attraction, but I don't know.

My parents almost never touched me when I was a kid. I didn't have affectionate friends either. When I was about 14, a boy in my class put his hand on my shoulder as he passed by me and said, ""hello"". It was an amazing experience for me. I had just discovered that I enjoy touch. I really hadn't even known what I was missing until then. I'm not sure how common my experience is.

I have done some research about touch, but there isn't much out there. I learned that children who aren't shown affection tend to either need a lot of it as adults, or they become adverse to it. The lack of touch can be very damaging to infants. Americans in general are somewhat affectionate, but there are places where showing affection is more common. Does anyone know of some good research?

I find day to day life really lacking when it comes to touch. I wish that people were more open to showing and receiving affection. I have to be careful with who I touch because some men are really uncomfortable with being touched. I take notice when a guy brushes against me. I have to wonder if he craves touch too. I will admit to subtly touching a guy like that many times. When I ride the bus, or I'm at a movie I wonder if I will be next to a guy that will let his leg touch mine. This is very stressful. If I allow my leg to touch his, will he quickly pull away? Will I make him uncomfortable, or will he appreciate the contact too? I'm sure that some guys hardly notice the touch; they neither like nor dislike it. If the guy seems to like the touch, I will move my leg up and down very slightly once or twice. If he does the same, it is great! If this causes him to pull away, I feel guilty for invading his space.

I studied massage therapy and worked in the field for a while. This became draining for me; I gave touch, but I rarely got any back. Not that I was expecting to be touched, I just didn't know that it would be so difficult to give and not get any touch back. It reminded me of how much I wanted to receive touch.

After I've interacted with a man several times (like at work, for example), sometimes I put my hand on his shoulder for moment. I hope that he will reciprocate later, but usually he doesn't. I never want to be pushy because I know that some guys are really uncomfortable with being touched.

I was with a guy from work last night at my place. We had good conversation, not just the usual superficial type. I felt a little lonely though because we had no physical contact. For me, good conversation with no physical contact can be lonely. I asked him if he was okay with hugging each other. He thought it was odd that I asked, but he was fine with it, and he gave me a nice hug. I think it's interesting that we have worked together for two years or so, and he never touched me until last night. We probably shook hands when we first met, but that was about it. When I was a teenager working my first job, several guys were very affectionate with me. As time goes on, it is harder and harder to find men like this.

People are very affectionate with pets; it seems that a lot of people would rather get affection needs met with a pet. I'm sure that many dogs get much more affection than I do! This is sad. Pets really do little for me. We had dogs when I was younger, but I never felt really close to them.

Sometimes I go for weeks with little affection. This really wears on me. I deal with depression, and I know that some touch would help. Affection is a great stress reliever too.

I was hoping to find some men that relate and share some thoughts with me. I'm very comfortable with meeting if there is a good connection. I hate texting, and emailing isn't much better. I'm good with talking on the phone at first, but I prefer meeting in person.

I'm a very nice guy, sensitive, down-to-earth, respectful, intelligent, very honest and introverted. I like meeting all kinds of nice people. Making new friends would be nice. I especially like real friends that don't mind helping each other (even working) when needed. However, I don't have a specific agenda. If you just want to talk about something, I'm open to that too. There doesn't have to be any physical attraction between us for us to be platonic friends, and I'm not going to refuse to meet someone just because I feel no physical attraction. If this is important to you, say so up front. Otherwise we may spend time together only for both of us to be frustrated later. I hug people that I'm not physically attracted, but it would be difficult to cuddle with someone that I wasn't physically attracted to. So, if you care, I'm 6-2, bearded, brown/gray hair, leaner than average, young-looking for my age, and handsome (your opinion may vary). I'm mostly attracted to guys around my age or younger. Again, it's more about the person inside than what's on the outside.

Keywords describing me, likes, etc: trustworthy, caring, fitness, floral design, atheist, respectful, long walks, deep conversation, hugs, personal growth, volunteerism, gardening, quietness, reflection, and lots more.

When responding, please include a pic and something about yourself. Also, let me know what you want. I will share a recent pic too. Also, change the subject line in the email. Yahoo emails end up getting grouped together by subject, and it can get very confusing.

One more thing. There are men on here that post ads, and they clearly aren't interested in platonic friends. Please help to clean these ads out. Open the ad and click on the ""prohibited"" link at the top. If several people do this, the ad is removed. Thanks. I hope to hear from you!

These 3 things are most definitely dependent on if you get a reply or not....kidding. ;) I'm not expecting a ton out of CL but can't hurt to try, right? :)

Does anybody still use yahoo messenger? Would like to share time just chatting about anything. I am emotionally available and committed to personal growth. However, I am also a poet. In order to maintain perspective of the human condition I am somewhat detached from it. Socrates quotes ""To have a penis is to be chained to a madman."" By default my ideology, as a translator, precludes its own interaction in MY life. Therefor I have posted as strictly platonic. I believe that I would make a good friend. I am not crazy yet I still believe in love and as Plato says ""Love is a serious mental disease."" I believe that true friendship is platonic love and that's what i desire. Perhaps it's a step out of the clouds and into the worldly to desire. Yet the heart beats blindly with the memory of love. In the world yet not of the world, mayhap we all have a serious mental disease from the beating of our hearts. I am emotionally available and committed to personal growth and would like to share time just chatting about anything.

Hi there, I am looking to make some good friends. Hoping to chat through email/text/facebook for a bit before actually meeting. I have every intention of meeting within a couple weeks, so please be serious about it too.

A little about me; I'm 26 and moved to MN almost 8 years ago. I love animals, have a few pets of my own and would definitely have more if I could. I try to do as much as I can out with my two dogs. I like to explore different parks, go on walks - I really think I would like hiking, but haven't actually done it yet. I'm a little artsy/crafty, I like to make things. I used to draw, still write a little bit and like to read. I'm into photography as well and like underground rap mostly for music but listen to almost anything. Also love piercings and tattoos :)


Let me know if you're interested and we can go from there! Please send a picture and I will reply with the same. Thanks!

After reading ad after ad on Craig's List about individuals seeking to find a relationship offering meaning, contentment, or an opportunity to be spanked by a dominant transgender nun, I have decided that all I really want right now is a pretend relationship or virtual ""fling.""

The benefits of a pretend relationship/fling, lie in being able to communicate (via email only) with another individual about things that are not actually occurring in one's life. It's the incredible chance to be completely dishonest with another individual who wants nothing more than a beautiful pretend connection with another soul.

We needn't share photos, real names, or accurate personal data. I will never ask you to call me, meet me, or send me your bank account routing number to help a deposed Nigerian dictator who will pay you back in millions. I just want to have a deep, intense relationship that has no actual roots in reality.

To be my pretend girlfriend/fling, you must be exceedingly intelligent, articulate and edgy. Your sense of humor must be phenomenal -- I would never pretend date someone who was not incredibly funny. You should be quite beautiful with striking features, (though I will never really know if it's true). It's essential that your mastery of English includes proper spelling. I will pretend break-up with you in a heartbeat if you make lots of typos. That's a major turn off...

I am, of course with this being pretend, a really bright, very good looking physician, who is coming off of a very painful, faux break up, so I might be pretend rebounding right now.

Potential pretend girlfriends/flings please note: I will not respond to any replies that include photos of your penis. (I don't expect any such replies, but it seems like that's what everyone writes at the end of their ads...)

Hey there Ladies!

Okay, I realize this request is extremely specific and maybe a little unorthodox, but what the hell, it's Craigslist...right?

The short version: I love working out, I am big into fitness and neither my wife (yes, I said wife) nor my friends share this passion. The adrenaline, the feeling of accomplishment and the excitement that this part of my life brings out needs to be celebrated, it wants to be fueled by someone else with similar goals and experiences. My wife and friends do not understand and frankly don't want to talk about it. I guess I am kind of looking for a BFF (best fitness friend). Someone to help push me, someone I help to push. Share successes, failures and someone to keep each other on track! Maybe we work out together, maybe we just root each other on, maybe someone to say ""get out of bed and get your ass to work!!!"". I think these feelings and these experiences need to be shared and celebrated and what better than someone experiencing the same thing, maybe needing a little help and just excited about being healthy???

So, why am I looking for a woman you ask? Well, let me say this up front. I am looking for nothing besides a BFF and this is a totally innocent platonic post, however, working out and fitness comes with some excitement and tension I thought I could be exciting to share this with someone that these feelings could simmer a bit. Because this is innocent, I don't care if you are married, single, engaged...whatever. Just looking for someone who shares my passion and maybe looking for a partner to share it with.

I don't need to share pics, but am far from afraid too if you are interested. Let's start with talking about our goals, our routines and maybe try to help each other on where to go. Maybe we email each other just once and we move on with some good ideas, or maybe we text every day helping push each other to the next level and maybe even work out together. Cardio, lifting, intense, laid back, I am open to anything. 

If any of this sounds like something interesting, send me a line and let's chat?

Thanks!!!

Or would it be Spousal-Attention-Deficit-Disorder? Hmm?

So why the ad you ask? Simple, I got to thinking that I might as well chat with others that feel the same way - that just don't get the attention they deserve from their SO. I have heard that this is a great place to look. Some say there are more than a few of us here.

I hope to hear back from someone who is inquisitive, open minded, educated, smart, well-read and yes, you guessed it - married. You should have a playful sense of humor, and a little sarcasm can go a long way as well. I am open to making new friends if nothing more. 

If you're interested in getting to know me, you would have to like good-looking guys that are smart and funny, have a lot of energy, honest (other than the obvious), confident, and have been known to be a little bit naughty. I have a nice smile, brown hair, blue eyes, I am 5' 10"" 180 lbs, I work out almost everyday and I think I look pretty good for an old guy (39)!

Tell me a bit about you, your looks (be as descriptive as you can), your situation. How long have you been married? How long have you been thinking about looking around? Have you done this before? What city do you live in? I understand the need for discretion, so if not the exact city, one that is near you. Also tell me something that I would find interesting about you.

I am available to chat over email most days while I am at work, and in the evenings after my wife and children have retired for the night. We are getting ahead of ourselves here, but I thought it should be mentioned that I am able to make myself available in the evenings when needed.

Let's get this party started!

Hi, I don't know your situation or your reason for checking out these ads. Maybe you are bored and just get a kick out of how corny, rude, silly, nasty most of them are. Maybe you just need to leave reality behind for a bit. Well hopefully here's one you might consider answering. 

Like you I'm not here looking for love or drugs or used undies or nakid pictures. I'm here hoping there's someone out there who's not looking to change their situation but is missing the excitement of someone new. A reason to look at your phone, to get excited about the next email, your next thoughtful email gets a thoughtful response back, and the next meeting ... the butterflies that thought will bring. Maybe you've been married a long time and the thrill is gone maybe your husband/boyfriend hangs out with his friends more than you like. Whatever the reason (I can give you mine) if you'd like to e mail a bit with someone new. Someone you would have never met ... then give it a try. If we don't click nothing lost.

Hope to hear from you.

Lightly used hubby. Still in ownership, however engine has not been started recently. Body is in excellent condition and motor is very strong. Will just need a jump start. Looking for someone with a strong battery to assist in jumping. Will need a strong spark. 

So.......We all know what this is about I hope. Same old story. Married with no passion. Not leaving marriage, but still wanting to find said passion. Probably a bit selfish and foolish, but what the hell, I am a guy and with the right woman, I love sex. So what am I looking for? Someone cute and in shape. Someone adventurous, sexy and of course passionate. Good sense of humor always helps as well as a few brain cells. 

Me? 5'10"" and about 180 lbs. I am very athletic, attractive, smart, sarcastic, adventurous, and passionate. Excellent kisser, greatly enjoy giving as well as receiving. Oh and of course I almost forgot to mention, perfect. Well that's not true, but it is sarcastic.

I often times have a dry sense of humor and can be sarcastic at times! If I tease you...it means I like you! Please be open to chatting on Kik or texting.

So here it is as best i can explain it...i do in fact exist im 38 white and possibly the most repulsive thing ever roam this earth. God gave me the gift of mechanical understanding but it came at the cost of being socially retarded (its difficult for me to interact with people outside of the requirements of my job) im not stupid or a pussy although a pacifist i will only back up so far before i react in an unpleasant manner (usually to the point of an over thought extream) .i know that no one could love me and would ask not that as i have not the credentials to ask anyone to feel anything for me ( even if they could they'd still have to want too) im painful to look at and i suspect unpleasant to be around i dont feel much anymore but what i do is felt with more depth than most people put into their lives thus the pain caused is greater resulting in a decreased desire for me to attempt interaction with women i am in fact socially incompetent as i have never been able to know if anyone liked me or no one ever has this has made me wonder as to what it would be like. This doesn't matter though. ..what is if importance is if you are curious or compassionate enough to willingly suffer the indignity of being seen in public with me and most importantly would you tell me honestly what you notice to be inadequate with me so i can attempt to rectify such defences im not fat but i am not nice to look at. I can honesty claim to have the ability to sufficiency repair any machine as required to return it to service but i dont know how to ask for a date and dont know that i have the right too as it would only create an awkward moment tell an escape was found creating an comfortable situation for someone because they of no fault of ther own i felt necessary to approach them. so i dont. i might be that retarded cat that everyone gawks at but i got more shit trapped in my head then their lives will allow them to understand intelligence is not easily perceived my job currently is to reconstruct machines to do things the designers did not intend them to do this comes naturally to me as a gift from god but the most basic of human existence eludes me id like to know the reason for this complication that is such a great obstacle in my quest for a happiness if you want to meet me id know that no possibilities are intended and i expect nothing in return so if something like boredom or morbid curiosity would draw you to subject yourself to interaction with me id be happy to take you on a date for as long as you could stand it hoping you'd tell me where/what/how i failed before you run off this would be appreciated as i can not seek for change if i dont know where to begin

So here I sit, totally bored and I decide to look at the ""men seeking"" sections. I know that CL if full of more dudes than women, but after looking at the ads, I know why now! The amount of guys showing their dicks, or bodies, or talking about what they would like to do freaked ME out, I can only imagine what women think! What's worse is, I'm sure there might even be chicks that reply to them!

So should I be posting my dick on here, or putting a pic of me in a dress or something to get women to reply? Maybe I should be saying how much I want pussy? Don't get me wrong, I have plenty of kink, but I'm not going to go post it all publicly for everyone to see!

Here's the deal. I'm bored, but can't sit here and laugh at the weird dudes on here anymore. I'm normal, good for a laugh, and won't send a dick pic or anything like that. Send me a message, change the title to whatever...I don't care what to (so I know you're not phishing). Let's be friends! Let me see if I can make you laugh without being a freak! :)

Please Please Please understand that but if the good lord makes it happen then so be it.

The type of person I find I get along with... One that has a job, One that is positive person, One that loves to chat, Honesty, Respect, trustworthy, Gal that smiles a lot, Someone that will go outta there way to help a friend. Someone that didn't vote for Obama. Please be a average person with a average look.

Things I enjoy doing, hanging with my daughter, hunting, fishing, camping, bonefires, atving, motorcycles, remodeling homes, playing in the yard, parks, fairs, road trips and so much more.

Hello,

So I've been pondering a question I have... Would a straight guy date and care for a Transexual? I'm a young guy who feels like a woman stuck in a dude's body. I'm not attracted to gay fem guys. I've always been attracted to straight manly man. I've debated going through sex change cause I feel so alone and unwanted/unhappy. That's why I wonder if I start sex change therapy would I be happier and find a guy who'd possibly want me. Or am I doomed to be where I am. 

Thx.

Hi,

Thanks for visiting the Ad. I am not a frequent visitor to CL, but currently in look for a friend or a online chat partner to just talk about anything and share/discuss our interests, while respecting each other's limitations. I am a married male, 30 yrs, of height 5'10"", with average body and no habit of smoke / drug and disease free. Would love to exchange emails and see if we like having conversations and take it forward. I do not see our relationship going beyond than being platonic. Even if we develop, I guess we all know to remain as friends. 

Also, I am of Indian(sub-continent) origin with wheatish color. I know few are sensitive about Race, appearance,etc... and have their own preference. If you are still interested, plz free to respond. I guess, with no luxury to buy time, let have more experiences and create memories with the life we have. I have no preference on race, color/appearance... just be interested to have a meaningful chat. I work weekdays with evenings and weekends being free. Please email me with your pic. Shall do the same with a pic and number upon your response. 

Have a nice time and hopefully sunday's forecasted warmer temperatures sticks on through out the week

It is nice to be appreciated and see that twinkle in the eye...isn't it? Or am I alone in this thought? 

Would be nice to share coffee and conversations with a special lady and see that twinkle...again. 

Being just 'friends' allows for the conversation to be broader and in many ways more fulfilling. Outright sex tends to inhibit things. Strange but true. 

It is nice to just appreciate someone without going any farther. What can I say....I must be easily amused? Maybe not though. There is something very full filling with not getting what you THINK you want and finding that not getting what you want opens up ways of feeling and appreciating what you do have or think about. It is kind of like looking at the chocolate bar...Yum.....Okay....now go ahead .....savor ...unwrap ....hold in your hand...then mouth....slowly....let it melt and feel that huge overwhelming sense of chocolate heaven? Sure you did and a hersheys (let's be patriotic) wasn't even in sight! Ahem.....are you connecting the dots? Yup....same can be done with 'whoopie'. 

My ideal box of chocolates looks and acts (you know chocolate comes in all sorts of sizes and shapes and personas....bunny rabbits.....and god knows what else!) is as follows:

She is pretty smart, brainy, a reader/bookworm. Young 20's ...30's. Brunette. Brown eyes. Pretty face. Fair complexion. NOT SKINNY. On the plump or more side. You like to use clothes to set off your feminine ways. And can say a lot with just her...eyes.

Okay fair is fair. 50, but young 50, WM, overly educated, very nice attractive appearance. Tall, blue eyed, nice skin, teeth, hands, etc. I am very well domesticated ( I bet that might be part of the problem?). Medium build and super clean and safe. I mean I would make Howard Hughes look dirty! Now there I just really dated myself. 

Do you like to flirt and be appreciated for all of you and keep your clothes on, too? Get that warm buzz feeling from head to toe? Be on the edge of your seat just alittle and enjoy getting alittle extra attention for YOU....not for some magic you perform in your daily life.....you know....for the boss or customer....or family.....that was a great sale....you performed that well...nice dinner and love your apple pie. All that is nice but are YOU a sale? A tax collection unit? An apple pie? 

Come on you know what I am talking about. It is pretty basic...human ...need. Or am I alone in this feeling?

Hope not.

Enjoy the Spring. And remember...it's later than you think!

Hello, I'm looking for a male or female friend to exchange emails with. Someone with similar interests, perhaps. Here are some things which I enjoy: reading, writing, poetry, Buddhism, consciousness, spirituality, psychology, simple life, thrift stores, animals, nature, philosophy, holistic healing. I believe in kindness and compassion. I hope to find a friend who is similar in some ways. I'm a white woman in my 30s. Please don't delete my post. I'm a real person, seeking a real friend to exchange emails with. I'm not looking to meet or for intimacy. I hope we can write to each other about our day, our interests and thoughts - be it on philosophical topics or the mundane. Thank you very much!

Please don't respond if you're over 45. I need some friends and it has worked pretty awesome for me here before so here I go again. Where did they go you ask? Good question....not too sure, but a few theories:
Their baby momma drama took over.

They were overcome with guilt about kissing me because they had a girlfriend.

They thought I was falling for them.

They were on house arrest.

They need to lighten up and stop trying to use their brains.

I am annoying and/or a meanie.

Here's what I need. Someone cool to hang with who isnt going to get all dumb with the mind games. Not afraid of a flirty kisser and most of all....you have to be able to make it past meet up number 3....it can happen. Let's be creative. Jenga at the park, fly a kite by a lake (kites are now being sold in stores, exciting) look at the stars by a fire, and since it will be out nice soon why not golf intoxicated .... so you don't notice how horrible I am, or talk about my garden game plan...

I'm looking for someone to join me on the occasional cross country flight while I'm shopping for my next plane. My current plane is a 1967 Piper Cherokee 140. It's a small 4 seat airplane nothing fancy (see picture).

The trip will vary depending on where the plane is. For example, I saw one in the Chicago area, the way there was about 3 hours 20 minutes. The trip back took just under 5 hours and I stopped part way for lunch. The trip could have been longer or shorter each way depending on headwinds. 

I'm looking for someone that enjoys flying in small planes and likes to talk about whatever. I'm planning on overnight stays, not looking for sex, just company. 

Weight does matter for aircraft limitations (and size those things are pretty small inside) but there is room for 4 total so if you have a friend or two that wants to come along they would be welcome. Combined passengers must weigh total 350 pounds or less. I can land at nearly any airport to pick you up on my way. 

Notes- I'm not leaving anyone anywhere, not a taxi service, not picking anyone up. No alcohol, drugs or smoking must be clean in general. 

About me, I'm 34 nearly divorced (it's complicated) with 2 wonderful kids ages 10 and 12. I work nights on the weekends and have 4 days off each week. I love flying, and the outdoors, lots of other things we can talk about too. 

Texting is awesome@ 2one8-eight31-seven122 my name is Derek send 'Copilot' so I know you are people. 

P.S. If you can't make a flight like this happen, I fly into Duluth a lot in the evenings (usually pretty late) that might be another option. If you think this sort of thing sounds fun feel free to text me and maybe we'll be able to meet up some time to fly somewhere.

Hello and happy almost week over day. If you are anything like me, you are struggling to get much accomplished at work today so that is why you are killing time on CL reading my post.

Basics here. 32 year old married man with no dreams of changing that. 
But as we all claim, women get along better with men and men get along better with women. 

I used to have a decent amount of lady friends but the wife didnt like them so we kind of last connection. 

I would love to find a great gal who is looking for platonic only. We can text or chat the days away. Maybe sneak out for a walk or a movie on nice days. 
And of course this gentleman would love to hit happy hour for some giggles and drinks.


If I havent bored you by now and you want to learn more please send me a message and lets chat.

Are you between the ages of 30-45, married/attached, reading this at your office, thinking about all the nut cases on CL and if you could find a Gerard Butler or Javier Bardem for a passionate romance and affair? You are unhappy or dissatisfied at home but don't see yourself ever breaking it but still want some moments of pure happiness and some love and affection you deserve. Or maybe, like most men, you too can't find satisfaction from sex with one partner for the rest of your life and like to fantasize about other men. You have talked to men on CL before but some were too pushy, some were weird, some were unattractive, and some seems promising until you learn more about them - essentially you have not had success in finding the man of your fantasy here. But you are still here, either you are addicted or find this thrilling, or simply because there are not whole lot of options for a married man/woman to flirt and cheat without risking the home. 

Well, let me make a case for myself now. I am certainly not a Gerard Butler or Javier Bardem look-alike :-) (if you find some here on CL, I would say there must be some BIG reasons why they are here). Now that said, some do find me charming, funny, witty :-) I am 37, married, and I live a very normal/boring life and looking for some excitement. I have exchanged emails/fantasies with women previously here on CL but now I want to find someone with whom I can eventually meet in person. If you consider yourself a normal person - then I want to hear from you.

I'm always fascinated with the human condition - the things we do, the things we choose to believe... and the cognitive processes behind that, from genetic predisposition, to environmental influences.

Few things engage me like a great conversation. Unlike some, I value differences in people, and would much rather interact with someone who is different from me that similar.

So pick your poison: politics, sex, religion, self actualization... But if you have a position, I expect it to be an *educated* position.

I am an artist and have drawn plenty of nude models but I have always wanted to try modeling myself. Ideally I would love to end up modeling for a class, but I would like to test the waters out with someone first. I'm not looking to be paid for my modeling, just to see how comfortable I am with it. You don't need to be an amazing artist, to be honest this is more for me to practice poses. Also, if you wanted I would be happy to draw you also, clothed or nude. Taking turns modeling and drawing would be pretty great I think. I have a couple roommates so setting up a drawing session here would be very difficult, so we would most likely need to set up at your place or a studio space you have access to. 

I am 28, 5'9"", a pretty average build. I have a masters degree in visual arts. I'm intelligent and respectful.
*The image above is not of me. Obviously, having never modeled, lol. It is more to show perspective artists what I am hoping to do.

If you happen to see this just know I'm miss our friendship quite a bit and regret the argument we had. You were going through at the time your stepdaughter being sick.

Hey there. I'm reaching out to the universe in hopes of finding someone I can share certain consciousness-expanding experiences with :). 

I find that I prefer feminine energy with these types of experiences, but I sincerely wish to keep it platonic as I just got out of two relationships in the past 6 months-- they're too taxing to maintain at this point in my life. I'm a damn good friend though.

A bit about me:

I'm attractive (legitimate male model/actor) and fairly intelligent with a witty sense of humor. I have a passion for learning the arts and creative expression. I read, draw, paint and work quite a bit.

I guess I'm just reaching out to find people who I can share new adventures with whilst forming a bond. I have great friends, but they aren't into some of the things I am, hence my posting here.

I have a car I'm currently getting fixed, and I should have my own place soon.

Yes, I will send pictures before/if we decide to chill, so feel free to ask after telling me about about yourself.

Ok. I'm sure some judgemental bored miserable person will flag this again. I'll just repost. I'm sure I sound like a broken record. I have been married a very long time. I have made great effort in my relationship over the years to keep it fun, full of passion and interesting. I am not looking for anything in particular but I am a man that needs to nurture, care for and have someone to love. I love good conversation, wine dates, or just chatting. I am respectful and will respect your boundaries as you will mine. I know there is someone out there in my situation that would just love to be noticed and held again. A morning text or email. Friends works for me too. I have thought this through, I do not need your opinion or your counseling. I am in my 50s and understand life. I prefer my age or older.

I know this is short notice but.... I have an extra ticket for the Wild game this evening against Colorado. I am looking for someone to join me so the seat does not go empty. Age is not an issue, I am 57 and just looking for someone to use a free ticket. We could meet up at a local bar for a beer then head to the game.

Seriously. Non sexual, non come on, just pictures of you for your own record or to surprise/bless someone special with now or when that time comes.

Selfies don't do it. For one thing your arm isn't long enough. It is very limiting. The other is....well obvious, you see yourself as a woman, not as a man would see you. So your perspective, both ability to take nice pictures of yourself and your 'point of view' restrict the possibilities. 

We use your camera, so you have complete control over your intimate pictures. But you produce a record that you will cherish and, let's face it, won't always be there. I am very artistic and take wonderful pictures. I have a long history in the visual arts. Have a great eye for composition and the female figure. I have seen countless approaches taken from fine art to the stuff on the magazine rack. Your personality is key.

What is in it for me is simple. I am highly visual and taking beautiful pictures is a joy. Period. 

I am a tall, nice looking male, white, middle aged, well educated and very well domesticated. In other words, it will be just about taking your pictures.

So nothing to worry about. You might even have some fun seeing yourself in a different light and have some ideas of your own. 

The more light reflexes the better. What I am saying is being a full figured woman is an asset when it comes to creating spectacular pictures. There is much more visual play between light and dark, depth of field and 3 point perspective. In other words the possibilities are endless and only limited by one's imagination. So if you have a lot to work with don't be shy. Blushing adds another element to your pictures.

Tell me what's on your mind and some ideas visually you have wanted to explore!

You and only you know how you wish to be portrayed. But

So I have to ask, why are so many married women looking on CL and posting ads on here, are you really looking for a ""platonic"" friendship? Are you missing something and actually hoping to find it on here? No judgment, just my curiosity. I am one of those people that look through all the ads on here and finally have decided to post an ad myself. I must admit I am married myself. I am not really sure what I am looking for (if anything). I am obviously missing several things in my own situation as I am sure you are as well. I have the afternoon off and feel like emailing with random people and see what happens I guess..lol I am pretty normal, laid back, interested in a variety of things from sports, politics, religion to the weather. Hope to hear from some sane people soon!

Now I'm not talking full blown sex benefits, but more the cuddling, touching, kissing, softer core benefits. I am leaving Minnesota in 3 short months. Moving away to be closer to my kids, or at least more accessible to them. My decision has led people to steer clear of me, and it has been a very lonely existence at times. Tell you what, if you are interested, send me a message. I will explain more then. I know for a lot of people, it's hard to get past the overweight, and average part.

Right, straight to the point. 
I like to draw and otherwise get involved in creative pursuits, and I'd like to make more friends these interests. 
I'd like someone who'd be down for just hanging out and drawing together from time to time (and doing other things, of course, this is just the main thing I'm looking for).

I'm personally from rice county... I don't mind driving up to the cities for friends if you're from up there, but if you're from closer to these parts, that'd be awesome too. 

I'm hoping to find someone who is open-minded, non-judgmental, and someone who will put a decent amount of effort into the friendship, someone who at least values positivity even if they don't always hit the mark. Someone I can feel comfortable around and trust (I'm a bit skittish and shy, and I'd like to find someone who doesn't have a problem with that). 

I'd prefer to meet friends who are also single.

A bit about myself and my interests, just so you can know if we'd have things in common.
* I like metal! Especially symphonic metals bands along the lines of Nightwish, but lots of others as well.
* I recently bought a sewing machine (meaning I fully intend to have a costume for RennFest this year)
* I like to read, and I work at a library
* I like trying to learn a lot of do-it-yourself kind of skills. Since I don't always do so well with people, it's nice to strengthen anything I can just do for myself.
* I like stories of all kinds. Literature, film, comic book, anime, history, video game, roleplaying, theatre... any kind. If you like stories too we'll get along absolutely swimmingly.

Have a nice day!

I want a real friendship that can lead us toward a long-lasting relationship. I believe that love is a Friendship on Fire! I believe that any relationship starts with friendship, respect and trust.

I'm multi-ethnic you would probably think I look latina, weight is not average but not anywhere near obese. I have a preference towards white men. Always have, always will.

I'm told I'm a very thoughtful and caring person. College educated (if you care, just don't proofread my post..hard to type on phones) Never smoked, never done drugs, rarely drink, but I love to have fun and laugh. Don't mind if you drink ect. I'm pretty laid back.

My interests are pretty broad. I like camping, traveling, action, suspence, horror movies, going for walks, people watching, being by a lake, kayaking, biking, softball, volleyball. One of my new things is eating healthier but not ready to throw in a serious workout...baby steps.

So that's about it. Hopefully I haven't bored ya and you want to send me a message

I've met a couple good friends off of the strictly platonic section of craigslist before, but haven't posted here in years. Randomly seemed like a good idea today. It would be great to meet someone who is cut from a similar cloth.

The mindful and openminded parts come from having Buddhist tendencies. I'm trying to live intentionally and spiritually is becoming more important to me as I get older. I'm also trying not to take myself too seriously. 

Other than that I'm a rather slender lad with long hair who has a myriad of interests. I look quite young for my age. I'm very sarcastic at times and love to laugh. I'm a student in the helping fields, which requires a great deal of tact and genuineness (and the accepting of suffering in life), but I have the skill of bringing humor to serious situations too. I'm compassionate, gentle, open-minded, very autonomous but supportive to people I let into my life. I like reading, fixing cars, sometimes brewing wine, meditating, and things done in nature. Right now my life is quiet busy with school, internship, and work, but in my spare time I like going out to see live music (primarily alternative rock, but open-minded), meeting people to talk over beers or tea, or otherwise finding entertaining ways to fart around. I don't like to put people in boxes, and don't like being put into a box by others.

Someone to have a dialogue with, go for a walk, go to the movies, out to eat etc. I am a Philosophy student at the University of Minnesota. I guess you could say I am a liberal thinking person. Always interested in learning new things. I deeply believe in HUMAN RIGHTS and am passionate about treating women with dignity and respect. I live at Cedar Riverside near the U of M. Not wealthy but manage anyway. If you are interested more in the person than the picture I would like to hear from you. [However, I have to say with some irony, please include a picture so I know who I am emailing.] I do not smoke, drink or use drugs. I'll tell you a little bit about me.You already know what I look like and my age so that done. I enjoy music, walks and conversation. I like playing tricks and having with people I am around. Quiet moments and reflection on philosophical matters really interest me. I love watching and have scores of documentaries from PBS and elsewhere about the brain, mind, politics, the 60s generation with its history and music, classical and jazz music, pets, academia, children playing, watching it rain, light hearted and deep conversation. There's more but for now. I believe I am an empathic, caring person. I believe in fairness, honesty and justice. These are traits I suppose a lot of people would embrace so maybe I am no different from anyone else. I hope that will help you decide what you want. I'll anxiously await your reply.

Meeting girls in grocery store parking lots to suck on their toes in the backseat of a car while people push carts past. That sort of thing. It was bizarre and funny and thrilling and confusing and I've never told anyone about it. I'm just looking for a pair of interested ears. Someone open-minded that I can tell my story to. I'm just looking to email right now. 

Hope to hear from you soon :)

So I don't have a whole lot of experience with this, but it sure was fun when I did it!! I put in Strictly platonic because I don't ever expect to meet. If we meet great, if not that's fine. I just want to have some fun with a girl I don't know. You can say whatever you want and no one will ever know about your dirty little fantasies!

I am looking to make a new great friend in which attraction may develop. I am looking for passable t girls who are interested in a swm.

I figured it would be fun to chat with someone so I replied to his ad. All of his questions were sexual, just looking to get off. No wonder why he is alone, it does not take long to see what a simple minded person is after. If I wanted sexual chat, I sure could do a hell of a lot better in another category instead if seeking it in the strictly platonic section.

I'm a 27 year old white male who lives in Burnsville right now. I work with disabled adults in a group home and I drive a small bus part-time. I recently was accepted into a school psychology program about an hour away from the Twin Cities, so will be starting that this September. I've been through 2 long-term unsuccessful relationships and have moved like 5 times in the last 5 years. I believe I'm a good guy at heart, but have just been through a bunch over the last several years with people. I kind of have a lot of bitter feelings towards people, especially women, and I'm working on getting rid of that. I work a ton so I don't really have too much of a chance to go out and meet people socially. I thought maybe there would be someone out there in a similar situation to me. Maybe you've just gotten out of a relationship with someone and feel hopeless, or maybe you're just lonely and need someone to talk to? If that's you maybe we could be friends. Even though I'm a bit of a nymphomaniac I'm seriously looking just for people to talk with. Although I'm sort of a boring guy, I have a lot of depth to me and I think I have a lot to contribute to the world and feel like I'm pretty mature in my thinking, as well. Well anyways, before this turns into a wall of text, shoot me an email?

Hi. Thanks for checking out my post. I am looking for a very discreet NSA situation with an attractive woman. If there is chemistry, this could be an on-going thing. 

A little about me... Professional, attractive, well groomed, intelligent, sane, and DDF. I am just shy of 6 feet tall and around 175 lbs. with a lean/muscular build. I am married and am not looking to change my situation - hopefully you can relate and don't judge.

I find women who are confident, comfortable with their bodies, playful, and know (and most importantly, can/do communicate) what they want/like to be incredibly sexy. I am fairly open when it comes to sex but also understand and respect boundaries.

My ideal evening involves meeting for some cocktails, a little flirting, and then going back to your place, slowly undressing each other and then doing whatever it takes to make you have the most earth shattering orgasm you've ever had. Preferably you have a high sex drive and are able to go multiple rounds.

Please change the title in the SUBJECT line of your response, include either photos or a description of yourselves in your response and use complete sentences and proper grammar. If you use any type of ""validation"" website/service, please don't bother responding. Sorry, no M, MW, or WMM - just not my thing.

Hey there. 

29 year old white guy looking for a new connection with a sweet gal. Not too worried about your status as long as you have time to talk, text and eventually hang out if we both agree on that. I'm 420 friendly, pretty hilarious I've been told. Don't take myself too seriously. Not a bad looking guy and just thought I'd see what may come of this. 

If your real reply with your hair color in the subject line. I'm very real and we're getting pretty close to surviving winter. A bit less than a month from spring!! 

Thank you!

Ill start by saying I'm not just looking to ""get high""; I have numerous chronic conditions that have been professionally diagnosed over the years, even though I'm fairly young (30). 

Without health insurance or a steady job, seeing specialists is impossible and seeing clinic doctors can be prohibitively expensive.

Oftentimes, like right now for example, I am given meds that do not work for me, or that I don't like the side effects of. I usually keep them in case they can help someone else.

Even if you just want to discuss living with pain, I can use friends who truly understand what this means.

I'm Specifically in need of tramadol/ultram but like I said, anyone who wants to talk is welcome to email me.

It's hard out here.

You know who I am talking about, that cute guy from down the street. The one who you see outside with his kids and always seem to notice when he passes by. The reason you take a little longer to get ready when you might see him at a neighborhood party. The guy who you always seem to lock eyes with slightly longer than you should.

Acting on those feelings could really make things complicated though. You are friends with his other half even though you know she doesn't make him happy. The rest of your neighbors are amazing and you really don't want to risk the gossip. The whole situation has the potential of turning in to one big mess.

Funny thing is, I bet there are situations like this in every neighborhood. I know there are a few in mine. Maybe the solution is to find someone in a neighborhood a little further away instead. Could be interesting to see what might happen...

Hey everyone!

I recently moved to Minneapolis and I have been starting to live a healthier lifestyle. I have been eating healthier and working out on a regular basis. It's been hard because I don't know anyone who lives close to me so I'd love to find someone who is passionate about health and fitness who is within meeting distance! 

Please note that I'm married so I'm strictly only looking for a friend. Male or female doesn't matter. I have a gym membership at Planet Fitness and I'm allowed to bring a friend with me each visit. It's getting warmer so I'm also looking for someone who loves the outdoors. I'd love to have someone who would be able to meet on a regular basis to play tennis, run, or go biking! I'm totally up for trying new classes or trainings as well. I'm up for anything active!

I hope to hear from you but if not, thank you for at least taking the time to read this! :)

""Every adversity, every failure, every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit"" -Napoleon Hill

Another weekend is soon upon us. You have others around you planning their days into the minutes and yet you know you'll be by yourself. Ever wonder how you can feel so alone in a house so full? Wonder how you went from friend and spouse to acquaintances and roommate? Lost in thought, feeling empty and missing the warmth of a simple touch? Not willing to change your situation but willing to sow a seed and grow something beautiful?

I'm a 40 year old attached devoted dad (to wonderful kids that I adore) and business professional. Healthy living and a focus on physical fitness have been how I have compensated for the lack of a connection or intimacy. I'm looking for that connection, the lost spark that makes your mood lighter and brings a smile to your face.

If this strikes a chord with you I can appreciate how you are feeling. Determine that today is the day that you will plant a seed and make something grow. Please put ""seeds"" in the subject line and include any details that you'd like to share.

Why Platonic? I'm looking for a connection that quenches a thirst mentally first, and with chemistry the physical component will follow naturally!

Have a great day!

Yes, I actually mean platonic, even though I'm single trying to date is not a priority for me right now. I'm a pretty normal person, I just moved back to the area and am looking for a/some new people to hang out with whether to watch/play sports, any competitive activity like darts, pool, or bowling, or of course just good conversation and have some wine or beer. Whether it's stories, politics, new ideas/technologies, random facts, debating a random topic, religion, jokes or just getting to know each other, I'm pretty easy to get along with. I've had an interesting life, and enjoy the intriguing ideas and unique thoughts and approaches. I am a divorced person who has struggled with depression in the past, I mention that just in case we can relate through some of the same issues. A little more about me is that I don't smoke, I am a Christian, I've never done drugs, and I do not have any kids. I'm also a proud INTJ if that means anything to you. 
If you think we might get along I hope you reach out and send me an e-mail, I know it is craigslist so I don't have much hope for this.

I know this is the platonic section, but I am not looking to ""hook up"" at all. I just want a fun friend that can hold a conversation, but also has a fun and flirty side that likes to send pictures, whether it is through texting, snapchat, or whatever. I am usually bored through the day at work, so it is nice to have a sexy friend that is like-minded and is in the same situation as me. So if you think you are up for it, send me a note.

Hi! So, I'm not sure what the deal is. I've lived in Woodbury for a little over 3 years and have failed to make a single friend. I will say that it is entirely possible that being a stay at home mom has affected my chances of meeting new people but I'm not a complete hermit. I get out but, at 30 years old it's a tad strange to ask random people to be your friend lol. I'm extroverted and chatty and admittedly too energized at times. My personality type is ENTP for those of you who know what that means. I am a social drinker and enjoy getting out of the house for whatever really. I like people but dislike dysfunction. We all have a little drama from time to time but if you can't stay out of jail or off drugs, we probably won't hit it off. I'd like to think I've got a pretty good sense of humor and am intelligent. I strongly dislike dull. Introverts probably wouldn't get along with me unless you're more of an extroverted introvert. Anyway, I wouldn't mind someome to go out to do girly things with or even just hang out. Like I said, I'm a mom so my outtings would either include my kids or I'd need to plan things out in advance so if that's not an issue and you think we may hit it off then drop me a line and lets see if we click! Note- I am not looking for side action as I'm happily married and I'm not looking for ANY male friends.... Hope to hear for you!

HI... Thanks for looking! However, please read in its entirety before flagging please :) I am a 39 yo looking for a friend to hang out with and do some shopping, movie, lunch etc periodically. This is strictly platonic. I live in the Maplewood area and only get out about 1 time per month during the day. I cannot get out in the evenings too much (sometimes later afternoon) or weekends for the most part. I am fun, humorous and respectful. I love living life and meeting new people. I live life to extremes as you will see. I am in good shape and very educated. However, I also love to cross-dress and have been doing it since I was very very young. Thats right...I am a guy. However, I have been leaning more to transitioning and am looking for a respectful woman to have some fun days out and have a friend to talk to. I have posted on T4W but all I get is guys wanting a transgender and women who just want to have a sexual experience. I am not like that so I thought I would post here and hope for the best. It is tough...believe me! Anyway, you can see from the pics that I take this very seriously and can pass (I think). I would like a real-person to get some feminine tips from including possibly some make-up ideas, clothing etc and just have some fun. YOU: must be nice, respectful, outgoing and able to communicate well. The next time I will be going out shopping Feb. 29 (Mon) I would like to email/text a bit first and get to know you. I would like somebody between the ages of 25-50 but depending on character I may budge LOL. Please contact me by putting ""nice friend"" in the subject line or I most likely will not even open it. NO GUYS!!!!! NO GUYS!!!!! NO GUYS!!! I will ask for pics at times to verify you are who you are...or try to anyways. I have tried this prior and got mostly junk responses.

I am looking for someone to train with. I am currently training for an Ironman, and needless to say my friends want nothing to do with that. lol
I have a history with marathons, and biking long distances. Swimming has always been a challenge for me. I'm getting better, but still my weakest link. I run and bike a lot outdoors. Getting out there as soon as the weather warms up. Now I currently train at Lifetime Fitness. I'm there usually 6 days a week. Not saying the person I train with needs to be that dedicated but having someone there two or three times a week would be perfect. 
What I'm looking for:
Someone that is really into running/biking/swimming. Not necessarily all three. A great benefit would be someone that is a solid swimmer to teach me a few things. I'm very confident in my ability but I'm smart enough to shut up and listen too. 
If this sounds interesting to any one please let me know. I would accept any pointers as well.

So it seems that no one knows what ""platonic"" means. At this stage of my life it's hard to make new friends. In high school and my early college years it was easy. Nowadays, people look at you like you have some ulterior motive or something. Maybe it's the society we live in these days *shrugs*. 

I am interested in meeting other guys close to my age (20s up to about 35 (must be old enough to drink. . . legally)). I am not discriminatory towards race or sexual preference, just understand that I'm looking to hangout, not make out.

About me:
I like to workout, watch sports (particularly football), play recreational sports and activities, bar games, going out for drinks on occasion, bonfires, video games (on occasion), go to concerts, see new movies (just saw Deadpool. . . it's a fourth wall break inside a fourth wall break! That's like. . . 16 walls!), rock climbing, and seeing the town amongst other things. 

Message me back if you're interested!

You never get a chance to unwind.

So, none of my friends are interested in seeing Deadpool but I'm definitely going to check it out. I don't mind going alone but I figured I'd see if anyone else was in a similar situation (or just wanted to see the movie with me because my ad was so charming and engaging) and wanted to come along. I'm planning on going tomorrow or Tuesday evening. If you're interested, respond with a photo and I'll do the same. I'm sure this post will generate TONS of responses but I'll get back to you as quickly as I can.

Hi, The company I work for recently opened an office in downtown Minneapolis.

Although I was born and raised in MN, I'm not very familiar with downtown Mpls. I'm excited for the energy, skyways and new places to go and see. 

Hoping to find someone (or more than one) to get to know and enjoys going out and exploring during the noon hour!

Looking forward to hearing from you!

I am a man eager to get back into life after recovering from a serious injury that put me in a 15 day coma and in rehabilitation for 14 years.
I was working at a summer job in college when an office air conditioner fell 3 stories on to my head.
I was out of life all these years and I have recently found a job I can do, gotten an apartment, passed my license renewal and now drive everywhere.
I'm just tired of leaving and coming back home alone everyday.
I don't want anything serious, just a friend with whom to enjoy the coming spring and summer. The only women I've known for 14 years were doctors, nurses and my relatives.
I don't discriminate and if your preferences limit your friendships along the lines of color and class, then please pass by my post and best of luck to you in your search.
I only ask you put the day's date in the subject line of your response to show you read my ad and are a real person. 
I won't respond if the date is not in the subject line.

About whom I am. I am 53 years old, brown eyes, salt/pepper hair. I am 5'9"" tall in good shape, I am muscular, but could use a little more weight, just my opinion. I have been told that I am a good looking man, maybe, I don't know. I had been married to the same women for 27 years until she passed away in 2006. My wife and I had 2 Sons, Ron and Mike. The kids were born 3 years apart, Ron being the oldest. Ron passed away in 1989 at the age of 6 years, his brother Mike followed him and passed away in 1981 at the age of six years old. My wife and I adopted a little boy at birth, David; he is 17 years old and now lives with his biological mother. I have been a widow since 2006 but since then live with a women that I love, but that love is no longer returned to me as she is seeing other (Men), that is plural. Knowing this I can not stay in a relationship with a woman that has destroyed trust and will not return love, I really believe that she is incapable of this. I have never cheated on my wife, and never cheated with who I am with now. But I do find myself lonely and needing to reach out and find life again.
I have always been a hard working man. I consider myself Honest, compassionate, caring, sympathetic, giving, and as my wife once had said to me that I was selfless. I do have a sense of humor, like to smile and laugh. I am driven, meaning that when I am put to task I tend to complete it no matter how difficult it can become.
I am looking for a Woman with the same traits that I have. Honesty, trust, and communication are very important to me and I look for these qualities in any future relationship I may have. I am looking for a woman who is a little strong willed, can hold her own with a little sarcasm on the side. This woman should feel comfortable in her own skin as well and feel good about herself. The Women I am looking for should be comfortable in jeans, and then feel just as good dressing up to go out, whether that be out to a club, dinner or formal outing. I am non judgmental and she should be as well, and this also holds true when she looks in the mirror at herself This Women that I have described here would complete me as I would hope that I would complete her has well. I believe that when the individual genders come together in a relationship such as I described, they become a whole new separate being, a being with two half's that complete the other.
I know that might have been a little long winded, please don't look at this any other way but trying to give you a complete picture of who this Man is, and please don't take this as a sign of weakness or desperation.
I hope that this has help you a little to understand this guy at the other end of the keyboard. I wish you well in everything you do and seek out. 

Yo, friendships are hard to keep track of and they change when you have kids and are married being a responsible adult and whatnot, so here I am on the blogoshpere up in your grill.

I'm happily married with two kids so no funny business unless it's the regular kind and not the adult kind.

So anyway, to business. Are you a human seeking another human to do stuff with? Like going to the mall with a grown man and his 2 toddlers? Building cool stuff or pretending to be an artist sometimes? Do you like anime, superheroes, tattoos, piercings, science, reading books in/not in the same room with other people? None of these things listed? Well then a friendship with yours truly may or may not be just for you!

So listing things is easier than trying to be humorous with everything.. Here goes.
Likes: Anime, Movies with depressing ending, building furniture, painting, drawing, drinking beers, karaoke, sincere/insincere conversations, judging people and feeling bad for being judgemental but doing it anyways, hand to hand combat, swordfighting, hiking kind of, hanging out with the family, being married, body modification, coffee.

Dislikes: Working on cars, slipping on ice, coffee that's too hot to drink, serial killers, romantic western novels, people who when asked what kind of music they like they say ""everything"", southern comfort, having always to be the one to call or text first, other stuff.

Don't know what else to say really, so. End

It's that time of year when I start thinking ahead towards the many different trails I'd like to hike. Are you the same way? I'm looking for someone who really likes long hikes on beautiful, scenic trails, especially ones that are at least moderately challenging.

Hey everyone! I assume that if you are reading this, you are a toker like myself that is interested in meeting other tokers. I am NOT looking for sex, just friendship and toking fun! That could include kicking back watching movies while we toke, going on drives or walks, etc. I love to toke indoors and outdoors, depending on the conditions!! Lol! I'm not much of a drinker, as I see it as a more harmful substance than others. Even if you don't toke, but are supportive of others that do, then I'd be happy to meet you! I don't smoke to get high, though it is great to be high. I smoke because I have chronic pain that otherwise keeps me from doing, or enjoying things that I like to do. It is the best medicine I have found out there, and I've been toking since high school, so about 12 years now, so I know how much it really helps me.

So it seems that no one knows what ""platonic"" means. Hint: It doesn't mean sex. At this stage of my life it's hard to make new friends. In high school and my early college years it was easy. Nowadays, people look at you like you have some ulterior motive or something. Maybe it's the society we live in these days *shrugs*. 

I am interested in meeting other guys close to my age (20s up to about 35 (must be old enough to drink. . . legally)). I am not discriminatory towards race or sexual preference, just understand that I'm looking to hangout, not make out.

About me:
I like to workout, watch sports (particularly football), play recreational sports and activities, bar games, going out for drinks on occasion, bonfires, video games (on occasion), go to concerts, see new movies (just saw Deadpool. . . it's a fourth wall break inside a fourth wall break! That's like. . . 16 walls!), rock climbing, and seeing the town amongst other things. 

Message me back if you're interested!

I know they are not real but they do have some good ideas. I'm not stupid, just hard of thinking. I believe my ex husband and former boyfriends would make excellent speed bumps for my driveway and it should hurt to be dumb and stupid people should be sterilized.....Just to tell you a little about myself.

Wondering if there's anyone else in my position. Been married for a few years now. My wife travels quite a bit for work and when she's home she is catching up with her friends and family. There's no connection anymore. We never talk. Never have time with each other. I'm looking for anyone that just wants to chat. I'm really not looking to run around on my wife, not looking to cheat. Just wondering if anyone else is in my shoes and wants to chat about it. Or really chat about anything... Let me know!
I'm a great guy. Great listener. Just a bit lonely is all .

I'm love baseball, history, I've been biking and would like to find a bike partner. I am a guys guy and am attracted to the same. Ideally we meet first for a beer or coffee. See if we have a connection then go from there. I am not opposed to sex but really want to get to know someone as well.

I have been married 15 years and have 2 kids. Wife is more of a roommate then a partner in life.

I have asked her to leave, but she is still here. 

I miss having a best friend to laugh with, talk to, share with , touch and be touched.

I want to be excited to just get a text from you, hear from you, share my day and hear about yours.

I am no George Clooney, in fact I am more like George Castanza so if you are looking for a buff model or a full head of hair you won't find it here.

What I am is a kind, educated person who will laugh with you as well as argue about things that don't really matter.

My kids come first in my life. 
Drop me a line if you think we have things in common. Because discretion is important, married only please.

Please put your fav beverage in subject line

So it seems that no one knows what ""platonic"" means. At this stage of my life it's hard to make new friends. In high school and my early college years it was easy. Nowadays, people look at you like you have some ulterior motive or something. Maybe it's the society we live in these days *shrugs*. 

I am interested in meeting other guys close to my age (20s up to about 35 (must be old enough to drink. . . legally)). I am not discriminatory towards race or sexual preference, just understand that I'm looking to hangout, not make out.

About me:
I like to workout, watch sports (particularly football), play recreational sports and activities, bar games, going out for drinks on occasion, bonfires, video games (on occasion), go to concerts, see new movies (just saw Deadpool. . . it's a fourth wall break inside a fourth wall break! That's like. . . 16 walls!), rock climbing, and seeing the town amongst other things. 

Message me back if you're interested!

Hi,

I would like to meet someone to grow a close friendship with. A bond that reaches beyond monthly dinner/coffee connections. I'm looking for a woman who is looking for a woman to talk to, about nothing, cook dinner with, watch Netflix with, shop with, go on vacation with, and comment on attractive men and women with. Yes, I am bi-sexual, but I am not looking for a relationship (meaning I am not trying to find someone to have sex with). I am, however, searching for female companionship, which to me, is more important.

Honesty is of the utmost importance to me, so if you struggle with lying, we won't pass go. I am also a physically fit person, so you should enjoy long walks, occasional workouts, and the idea of running.

If you have a genuine heart, and are looking for companionship in your life, please reply. We should talk. If you are a red-head, please definitely reply.

Looking to be friends with a younger-than-me woman. I could describe what sort of friendship dynamic I am particularly open to, but sometimes it is best to let things happen on their own. I am attentive, interesting, fun, well-traveled, active, and I have a wide range of interests. If we connect and are attracted to each other, lets share emails and chat about life. As my title states, I am looking for authentic, intimate connection--a sharing of hearts and minds. You should be thin, fit or athletic, prepared for a bit of verbal fun, perhaps some teasing and a bit of mystery. I am a down to earth, educated, employed Caucasian male. I am fit, athletic, handsome, and slightly roguish.

I am very curious about the dynamic of this type of relationship. 20 year old pretty girl with a 50 year old wm who is well educated and nice looking...and of course married to make it even more forbidden. 

So what's the deal? Are you in such a relationship now...or when you were in your 20's did you engage in this type of relationship and now with more experience can describe what was going on and may even wish to discuss it with someone who is interested in the why and wherefores of such a relationship...love? friendship....? other? Please enlighten me. 

Is it driven by a daddy thing? Or, perhaps financial and resource motivates. Is it that the 20 year old males act like 15 year olds and so a man in his 50s is attractive? Or you may have other reasons. 

I have inquired about this with women that have been in such a relationship but they are pretty secretive about it....even embarrassed. So what is the deal? Maybe here with the privacy of CL you can tell me what is going on and how it worked...or is working for you? 

I have never been in such a relationship but am very curious. At this point I am not asking to be in one really, just want to know more about it. 

Maybe too you would like to get some things off your chest? Maybe you would like to ask a man in his 50's what is going on....things you could not ask him (if in your case this happened in the past) and you have some burning questions of your own. 

Where you seduced? Did you seek it out? What was your own family dynamic like and how did that, now with the benefit of hindsight affect the choices and your outlook at the time...or if happening now, in the present?

Sincere Questions. Appreciate getting your take on it...from your experience, insights and wisdom.

Thanks!

Have you been or are you now in a relationship with an older man? That is are you perhaps in your 20s'...or were years ago...and were sleeping with a man in his 50's? 

I have personal reasons why I am trying to understand this and would appreciate insight as to how this happens and what would be going thru the mind and for that matter the body of a woman....pretty and smart yet would have an unconventional relationship, sometimes referred to as a 'forbidden relationship' of this type.

Is there a daddy thing going on? Is it the prospect of more resources? Is it being tired of 20 year old males with 15 year old mental capacity? I mean....what is the motivation? 

There must be some commonalities as well as extenuating circumstances that result in a pretty 20 year old woman getting involved with a man in his 50's. 

I am such a man myself. Educated, nice, good looking, white, etc. I do not have such a young woman in my life, not sure really if I would want that but am very curious about it. I know of people who have experiences this type of relationship but they clam up when I ask them about it. 

Perhaps here in the privacy of CL you can enlighten me, maybe get some things off your chest. I don't know. Whatever. 

I hope I hear from you. It would help me settle some questions that have bothered me for many years. 

Thank you. Really....I would really appreciate your insight...wisdom and knowledge.

Hello there!
I'm just a guy with his life pretty well together, but find myself with plenty of lonely/boring time (don't we all?).
So I would like to chat/get to know/make friends with a younger woman, since I find I get along much better with that type. And by these terms, no, I don't mean the typical-CL-guy bullshit; I'm not looking for a hookup. Sorry, ladies ;)

Just as a guide, I'd say probably 20s or 30s,cute (of course) but mostly, I'm looking for someone open-minded, smart, interesting/exciting/intriguing, with a sense of humor.

Hope to hear from someone who fits the description.

Oh, and if you have a problem or are offended with the title, then you definitely do NOT fit the description, and you should leave my post, CL, and probably the Internet altogether. Or google ""sense of humor"".

Are you in the co-existing phase of a long-term relationship? Perhaps in the beginning you shared a favorite tv show, now the tv is on simply to fill the silence? You pick out a movie to watch and your partner falls asleep routinely. You go to bed at different times and rarely even say good night. You talk about date night but you are the only one who researches ideas. The dog receives more affection than you?

Hello!

First off I am 29, very happily married, and would never change or hurt that, but I really enjoy getting to know new people, that are okay keeping it platonic, or risking any harm to anyone's relationship. I am also from Texas, and enjoy getting to know people from other areas as it removes the pressure to meet if there is a connection, and keep relationships safe.

I work from home most days, which also means I don't do much on those days, and it would be great to have someone new to get to know and share things with. I'm very open minded, goofy, extremely laid back, I don't judge, I'm allergic to drama, I can be really sarcastic but I know when to turn it off, easy to talk to, and I've had an interesting and unique life so far, so I think I have quite a few interesting things/stories to share. I also have a bit of a dirty mind, and might throw a ""that's what she said"" into a conversation at some point. I am also a major night owl, so if you are too, even better!

I am looking for someone who is: intelligent, funny, witty, understands sarcasm, open minded, non-judgemental, dirty minded, drama free (although venting is allowed), easy to talk with, and just fun.

Again not looking to meet or change anyone's relationship, just looking for fun conversations to get through the day or night.

Hope you are having a great day and I'm looking forward to chatting with you!

Don't we all need some push and motivation. I figure we can both help each other out by motivating and pushing each other to workout and eat healthy. Looking to connect with someone who is highly motivated and is in decent shape. Beginners are great and attached and married preferred, as I am too. Please, be in the South Metro. I have a gym membership with unlimited guest passes. Let me know what you are up to and your expectations. Here's to a healthy and happy 2106. Cheers.

I am looking for a platonic friend who would like to hang out and have their hair played with. Longer hair preferred, but any length or color is fine. I won't do anything permanent like coloring or cutting. Just gentle playing and styling, or anything you want really. I know how to do a bunch of different types of braids like french, dutch, waterfall etc.

If you enjoy having your hair played with, send me a message and let me know what you have in mind!

Dear ladies of Craigslist,

I am just curious if women on CL (ok -- especially the few attached/married women here) have the same issues find the right men as I seem to when it comes to finding a woman. I guess you are in demand and have lots of options here -- from total crazy to a little crazy.

All I want is just one woman on the side (besides my wife) -- I have a big heart but may not have capacity to love more than that :-). I am 37, fit/hwp but short (5'7""), so you decide if you are interested. I have dark hair and brown eyes. I try and get to the gym a few times a week. I have a graduate degree, a decent job, a wife and two kids, a house in a cul-de-sac in the suburbs . . .all I need is a secret paramour. 

You are smart and attractive, between the ages of 35 and 45, health conscious, adventurous (well, if you are here -- you are already adventurous). . . I do want this to be more than a virtual relationship -- so, hopefully you are open to meeting at some point. Based on prior experience - I think I may have already lost all of you by now - so, if you are still reading this, maybe that is some sort of signal :-)

Hi there! 

I've got a job interview on Thursday in Minneapolis. I'll be flying in Wednesday morning. 

I was hoping to spend Wednesday exploring the city to see if this is somewhere I could see myself staying for a while. 

It would be fun to explore Minneapolis with someone who already knows the area and could share with me their experiences. 

Let me know if you'd like to spend Wednesday going out and exploring Minneapolis together!! 

Thanks and have a great day.

Hi. This is my first time posting anything at all on Craigslist. 

I am looking for a buddy in their 20s to watch Deadpool with. Possible cuddling (if you're cute) in those power recliner seats. This is just a regular date and a non sexual encounter. Perhaps grab a bite to eat after to discuss the movie. No nightcaps. :))

Are you in need of something you can't talk about with your friends. Do you long for that time alone with a confident, attractive man, who gives you what you need, what you desire most...a warm red bottom. Many women secretly desire being spanked, panties pulled down, laid bare in front of a man. To be able to let go and release yourself. 

Does this describe you; 

""Personally I enjoy getting spanked because it helps me let go. Life is stressful and I don't want to deal with it sometimes. It's wonderful to know Im safe with you and you care about my need...to go over your knee and have my bottom walloped over and over. I become numb, I cry, and then the endorphins in my brain take over and I reach a euphoric high which you call my 'subspace'. And finally, when you've taken me as far as I can go, you hold me until I'm back, back in your arms and then you feathers me with kisses and talk about....whatever. 

This is what I offer to a chosen lady. Please be respectful, and honest with all your replies. 

I look forward to our time together. ;-)

Those reason sometimes involve finances, partner issues, or the lack of the previously mentioned. Additionally, I've witnessed incredible couples break up because the male could not produce children. This is such a tragedy! Recently I had a very dear friend approach me asking to help he and his spouse become pregnant. After much thought I accepted. It has turned out to be a rewarding experience, giving the gift of life to an amazing couple.

Hello,

I am a 32 year old straight male who is currently and very happily married. During my early and mid 20s, I explored my sexuality with both sexes. My exploration process allowed me to know so much about myself and I am thankful for that. And I am also glad that my sexual history is not a secret to my wife and the people who are closest to me. 

So I am wondering if (an)other man/men would want to message/converse about whether they have gone through similar experiences. And to me it does not matter whether you are bi, or not out, or still figuring it out. I am just wanting to converse about the process of finding ourselves and figuring out where we land in the sexuality spectrum, and what have been the least and most challenging experiences throughout the process.

I think this post speaks for itself, but I am not looking to exchange pictures or anything of that sort. I just would want to converse in a way that feels comfortable.

There are many keywords to describe what I am looking for but here is a list: DD (domestic discipline), HoH (Head of House), TiH (Taken in Hand), D/s, Daddy Dom, LTR, 1950s household.

I am looking for an intelligent young lady who will be a mix of wife, submissive, little girl.

I have been heavily attracted to the domestic discipline type of lifestyle, with aspects of D/s as well. Where the man is in charge of the household and my girl will have a set of rules and guild lines to live her life by in every day life. In the context of a loving relationship where peace and harmony is the norm, and me as a harsh disciplinarian when needed. She will know her place in the relationship and while I will acknowledge her opinions, thoughts, and concerns.. I will have the final say. If she breaks these rules or forgets her place, her behavior will be corrected with discipline appropriate for a young girl (spanking, mouth soaping, lectures, writing lines, grounding, corner time, etc..). Her position in the household will also be confirmed with other bdsm play to remind her of her place and because I enjoy it.

I want my girl to be intelligent, caring, loyal, funny, healthy, and of course obedient. Someone I can share ALL aspects of life with. When we go out together we would appear as a very close professional couple, but she would secretly know her place. If she starts getting out of hand or stops being respectful, a simple pat on the back or a glance would remind her and foreshadow what might be in store for her later that night if she continues. When we are behind closed doors, she will play the role of a submissive girlfriend/wife.

About me: I am a 37 year old Dom, with many years of experience in various types of play and a healthy appetite for new experiences. I am intelligent, strict, caring, grounded, good job, fiscally stable. I have my life in order but still searching for the right one. If the above type of lifestyle interests you msg me as I would like to talk further with you.

While I would prefer someone local for obvious reasons, I am willing to start a long distance relationship with the right person.. although I would not want it to drag on without fairly frequent meetings.

I am also available as a mentor / disciplinarian. As I enjoy helping people reach their goals via encouragement and corporal punishment.

It is all really about angle and lighting. The joke was if you put a fish eyed lens on any picture you will get the desired result. Not so. But we can do that route also and you can see what you like. 

Rubens and company were right though. So was Renoir. What I am getting at is I can do a lot with pen and paper or a camera but I can't pull rabbits out of hats. In other words you should have much to capture artistically. To put it even more plainly you should be at home with the following descriptions.

You are......fluffy, big, heavy set, plump, large bottomed, busty, fair skinned and pretty. Full figured to BBW to SSBBW. XXX ....20 W to 30W sized.

Never thought I would be posting on here, but I guess sometimes you need to take a chance. Wondering if there is anyone else out there like me.......attached, with a good career, early 40's, still in good shape and feeling great about themselves and generally speaking a pretty good family life. 

Well, why are you here one might ask? Well, there is one thing missing that I just am tired of doing without. That is having that ""someone"" whom you can share your day with, genuinely cares about what you are up to, and misses the flirting and excitement of talking to that other person....did they send a text or email....a nice distraction during the day. I feel I am ready to try and find this, so giving CL a try. I am not looking for any games or one night stands. Initially just looking to find someone to connect with and see what happens. Am I up for meeting possibly, sure, but we would both need to comfortable and respectful of each other's situations. 

Well, that is it. Short and simple. If you want to give me a hollar, please do. I will respond to all.

Thanks!

Hello,

Where to start:
I fell for the wrong woman, she is smart, sexy, mature, educated and accomplished. She is also married...

Anyway, not sure what I am looking for: she tells me that women should be all over me, not my experience though. I am 40, single, never married, no kids, east coast southern, educated, pretty smart, and i guess reasonably attractive...

I think I would like a friend, or maybe a soulmate, or maybe a friend with benefits, or maybe someone to just use me for sexual gratification. I really don't know at this point. I'm pretty busy but I have learned that I have time and make time for what I feel is important

Sorry to be so indecisive, maybe help me?

Hope you have an awesome day

I look forward to any responses and i don't just throw my pictures out into the net without having an idea of who I am sending them to. I will respect that of you as well

I am 47 years old 5'11"" 220 pounds and have been working out daily and playing racquetball 3-4 days per week as well. I love playing racquetball which is way more fun than spending an hour on the elliptical. I am married with 3 adult children and very bored these days. I have been married 25 years and I swear my spouse has turned into the man and me the women because she has no desire for intimacy. I want to hold hands, kiss and cuddle she just wants sex and to go our own separate ways following the act.
If you are looking for a guy to do these things with please send reply to this post. I am not looking to exchange pictures because I am married but I would like someone similar to me and to be attractive, outgoing and in a similar situation as I am in. It would be great if we could hang out, text, talk and become friends and hit it off! 
Again, I am not looking for sex because I have not been with another women for 20 plus years and it scares the crap out of me.

Thanks and I hope to here from you

ME: Just moved to Minnesota a few months ago. Seeking PLATONIC ONLY  FEMALE friends in their 30's/40's
I Always make time for friends. Love intelligent conversation, Coffee (or tea), movies, crocheting, Cooking and Baking!, being silly, gardening, farmer's markets, manicures,pedicures, bookstores, comedy shows. Other interests are natural remedies, playing Words with Friends, tai chi (would like to take classes), photography, travel.... Shows: Orphan Black, Game of Thrones, The Leftovers, Downton Abbey, Gotham
So far I've attended one Meetup friend's group and met another mother and their child for a playdate. Would love to meet some other people! Majority of responses have unfortunately been guys or people who email but never meet. 
I'm very laid-back, unpretentious, say what's on my mind, appreciate people with a sense of humor, currently living in Edina but don't mind driving (within Hennepin), to hang out. Enjoy meeting people from different cultures. Absolutely love ethnic foods. Anything , you name it! Thai, Indian, Dim Sum, sushi....

Recently moved to MN. GWM looking for gay workout partner. Strictly platonic for now. I've been lifting on and off since college. Decided to fully dedicate myself to lifting and would like to aim for entering a men's physique competition in spring 2017. Looking to cut now, bulk after summer. Highly dedicated to making moves in 2016 with strict nutrition and lifting schedule. Looking for accountability, and a little motivation if the chemistry is right. Have a heart, have a mind, have a goal -- and let's help each other out.
I'd consider myself a masculine guy, but the gym bro thing is a turnoff. 
Pics on the left are current. Right pic is 2 years ago -- like to get back to this shape and surpass it. Lots of work ahead -- looking to share the journey. 

Workout at Planet Fitness in Burnsville or LA Fitness in West St. Paul.

What things do you like to do?

Myself I enjoy reading, movies, hiking and I even like to get out and geocache. The beach is fun although not a lot of fun this time of year. I can't wait for spring. I am crazy enough that I signed up for a half marathon.

Over the years, I've had a couple of very pleasant extended interactions with women I've met via Craigslist. As you might imagine, this hasn't come easily. I've posted quite a few times, and most of the responses have been somehow off the mark. Sometimes respondents have been looking for a different kind of interaction; many times there has been a simple lack of chemistry; and, because it's CL, frequently the problem has been sheer lunacy on the part of the respondent.

With that history in mind, I think I can do a better job of articulating what I'm looking for and which type of woman might be the best fit for me in this endeavor. Please note: I'm not offering any kind of authoritative global commentary on what's ""right"" or ""good"" here; I'm merely stating what works for me -- an admittedly imperfect person. I respect the fact that it might not appeal to everyone, but I'm probably not interested in having an extended argument about how misguided or unfair I am. 

First, a little about me: I am an academic in my late 40s. I'm married and have a couple of kids. I am generally content with this situation. Truth be told, I'm not desperately unhappy. However, I find myself somewhat restless, and looking for sustained connections online. My goal in doing this isn't to engage in a torrid physical affair (more on that later) but rather to find steady electronic interaction (mainly via email) with someone who stimulates me intellectually, emotionally, and physically. Only one or two email per day probably won't be sufficient to hold my interest. And -- despite the length of this posting -- I'm usually not someone who writes a short essay with each response. I'm looking for short but fairly steady contact (knowing, of course, that sometimes life gets in the way and one can't always respond immediately).

My partners in this kind of interaction invariably have been younger -- usually women in the 32-40 age range. I am not sure why this is --honestly I'm not obsessed with the idea of connecting with a ""younger woman"" -- but I have found it to be comfortable. Also, they have been reasonably well educated and engaged in professional careers. (No, I won't be expecting to see a resume, but there will be more common ground with someone in a white collar occupation.) I'm a fit, active person, and I'd prefer someone who is similarly inclined (runner, yogi practitioner, etc.), or at least fits into the ""HWP"" category. There are some other characteristics that I value, but they seem rather generic and subjective: sense of humor, literacy, taste in music, books, wine, etc. 

Finally, regarding the possibility of meeting in person: It's not my primary goal. Furthermore, I'm posting this ad outside the area where I actually reside, so it would be extremely difficult to pull off. However, with the right person and under the perfect set of circumstances, I would entertain the possibility.

But first, let's email.

If you find yourself in a similar situation ... you're life is wonderful and complete ... yet, you feel like the misunderstood misfit ... maybe we can share a special kind of friendship connection.

I won't make any bold claims and say that we could be soulmates. After all ... to find out such a thing takes time and conversation to see what really makes the other person tick. 

You are probably a very successful person, you have much going for you and much to offer. People around you would never expect you to be searching the CL posts looking for a deeper connection as your life is already filled with good friends. 

Yet, still ... your heart and soul ache for something deeper. You're not looking for romance or sex (as wonderful as those things are) but more for someone that you feel can understand you on a level that most seem unable. 

I'm married and connect best with women in their 30's, but I am open to exploring a friendship with any adventurous woman who is looking for more than a diversion from daily life.

I am making a list; a list of fun activities and events to do and attend with my 12 years old daughter.

I am a divorced guy in the mid 40's. I have lived here for a while but not a native Minnesotan. As you know, between earning a living and life getting in the way of living, one get easily stuck in a rut.

I have my daughter alternating weekends but get stomped to figure out things to do. Her life at her mother's is essentially going from school back home. I am looking to add a more well rounded exposure. I am big on volunteering and that's something we have been doing a lot of lately. I, however, want to open her experience to various other activities especially ones that would be fun to do after volunteering.

I usually ask her what she would like to do for entertainment but the response is usually the same: I don't know. We have done some day trips and would love to add more. As it is said, the bare essentials of life are experience, growth, and contribution. I like to make a list to fill those buckets. I thought about playing a ""12 years old"" tourist with her. What would you put on the list if you were being a tour guide in the cities and Minnesota in general? I want to keep it as simple and minimum cost as possible.

I need your help. I will be happy to compile a list and share it with anyone else in similar situation.

Thanks for your response.

Cold, clear, calm autumn mornings lately. The weather pattern has been consistent. High pressure. The temp seems to hover right around 35 degrees F at dawn. Balmy. The sky twinkles with retreating stars and glows with pinks, purples, the warmer yellows of a sluggish sun on a jagged horizon. I'm out the door for work around 8am. That glowing ball has finally climbed its way above the foothills and I'm headed to town, West, with the low sun at my back, East. It's cold so full gear. Heavier gloves, heavy jeans, riding jacket with some protection for the back, shoulders, arms. This gives me a sense of false confidence. This is exactly what I do not need. I wear running shoes because it's easy to feel the shift lever and they are comfortable. The shoes are mesh and it feels cool when the wind blows through them. I gain speed, check mirrors, am blinded by the bright reflection of a beautiful sunrise behind me. Visor is up through sixth gear, the wind whistles around and through my helmet. Instantly awake. My eyes water. The visor goes down and I twist the wrist. 70 mph into town. 

It takes about a minute to get to the outskirts. 40 mph, 25 through old town, East Main, down through the gears and into second. I glance at the display. Tach-ing 4,000RPM's, engine temp is where it should be at 175 degrees. I note that the engine sounds great but there is a subtle rattle coming from a section of fairing. It's sleepy in town, not much traffic. I need to go to the bank on Main to deposit a check. Usually I go inside but it's too early for the lobby to be open so the drive thru it is. No one is there. I pull up, kick the stand, hop off, rummage through the backpack, start talking to the teller. She's really nice, and she's really cute. I notice after about 10 minutes of random conversation about our respective lives that she is really easy to talk to, that I don't have the $60 in cash I asked for, she still has my debit card, receipt, etc. Finding this comical, we both laugh at the situation as it unfolds. She's a bored teller from Boston. She's curious why I'm not in the slightest hurry to get to work like everyone else. She's beaming. That's what tellers do, right? We share a weird connection but I'm outside in full motorcycle gear leaning against a pole, shivering, wondering where all my shit is, and she's a beautiful woman dressed up in a glass booth. 

A van pulls up and she is forced to do her job. We say our goodbyes. She asks me if I want a lolly-pop for the road. They call them suckers here. Maybe there too? I told her no, I would probably crash and I just brushed my teeth anyway. She tells me that she's there all day if I change my mind. I laugh, thank her, start the bike. It revs high because the engine is cool. I make a quick left out of the bank and a right onto Main. Second gear, third gear. 40 mph. Buzzing to work with Thursday morning coffee smells in the air I'm thinking that my fingers are cold and it's getting harder to pull the clutch. Involuntarily I tilt over to grab my butt for a wallet check. I notice the heat of the sun on my back. It feels good. The maples around town are in full color. It's a beautiful morning. 

A light turns red and I stop. Samantha comes to mind and I think that I never even thought to ask her out. Not once. 

I'm just a simple guy here in Montana. Eyeing your area and will be exploring it eventually. Looking for someone to start some sort of dialogue with. Maybe words, maybe pictures, maybe some combination? 

I love people. But as a super-sweet ""pen pal"" and friend preferably you would be of a similar age, you would be sane, educated, empathetic, and able to write effectively. Ideally you're engaged in your community, you're active, you're in shape, you're petite, you're healthy, and you don't spend hours every day staring at your cell phone. 

Copious bonus points if you ride bicycles or if you're a 420 girl or if you're a hockey girl or if you write more than two sentences or if you don't send me something from your iPhone while you're stuck in traffic.

Do you exist? Write to me. Tell me a story.

Let me start by saying that I don't live in your city. I live hours away and I've had difficulty identifying like-minded black professional friends. 

I have a great career but my social life is lacking. I'm incredibly down-to-earth, relaxed, honest, etc.

I am in my late 20s and somehow I've made my career my life. I'm single and I don't have any children.

I enjoy traveling, shopping, relaxing at home, some reality TV, etc (I enjoy the simple things). Family and friends are incredibly important to me and above all else I am a Christian. 

I don't club, party or engage in the use of any type of drugs. I am a social drinker. 

If you are a educated black professional (relatively close in age) I would love to hear from you. I assure you that I'm as normal and sane as they come and CL is a unusual approach for me. 

Thanks for reading. . .

I was recently informed that there are a couple of nudist clubs just a short drive from St Paul. I've always been interested in going clothes free for a day, or a full weekend if all goes well. I'm a little bit shy about getting naked. My breasts are huge, and I have the ass to match. I'm worried that people will be judging me. I've read that most nudist club members are pretty judge free, but it'll always be at the back of my mind. To help counter this I'd like to spend the day, or weekend at the nudist club, with a couple whose female has the same/similar physical attributes as myself. I guess I'd even be open to just go with another female with similar features. As of today, Super Bowl Sumday, I'm single, but hope to be attached by the time when it'll be warm enough to have to pack nothing more than a towel for a weekend getaway. 

So, if you're a nudist couple, or even just interested in checking out a nudist club this summer, whose female 1/2 is a BBW, or you're a single BBW nudist, change the subject line in your email to whoever you think today's winner will be, and tell me a little bit about yourselves. Happy Super Bowl Sunday! (Please no single guys. True, I am single, but I've got my eye on someone)

I'm 23 and my depression is quit bad right now.
I've always have been a loner, but my social circle is down to nothing

impossible thing to do.
I'm looking for someone who get's that. Who know's some days are worse
than most. I still live at home. I'm not able to work much.
Lot's of times the medicine does more harm than anything else.
Now I have a mom and Dad, and everything's as dis-functionally fine as it 
can be.
But I want some who isn't family. I'd like someone older than me.
Who has wisdom. I'm not looking for sex or romance. 
I want to be close to you, to confide and laugh. To be friends but
more of that mother-son, or big sister-little brother, and the conventional peer friendship.
I'd like to email at first. Maybe talk on the phone. And hopefully we could spend time
together when I'm doing a little better. I was thinking meeting for lunch sometimes,
things like that.
This is by no means a requirement, but I was thinking you to be in the age
range of 40 to 60.
You can be married, single partnered, lesbian, or an alien. None of that matters
since this isn't about sex.

Hello,
I am a Non-binary Genderfluid person and need a friend who can be there when I need them. Someone who I can talk to, someone I can hang out with, someone who will help me out if they can, and cares about my day. Someone who could understand what I'm going through is a plus. Or at least someone who can be sympathetic. 

I am currently homeless and staying with a friend temporarily. I have Aspergers and I don't drive, but do take the bus when I can. I have no job yet, and just so much else that is making things harder. But I need to be around people sometimes and I need someone who will notice when my smile doesn't quite reach my eyes. 

If you feel like you are someone who could do that, then please message me back.

Long shot but you never succeed if you don't try right?

Anyways, I'm looking for a person who would want to sneak out with me every so often (tonight??) for some fun. 

Can be anything, grab a bite to eat, hit a bar, see a movie. whatever. 

I've been married for a long time and my spouse does not like to get out much anymore and it drags on me. I'm just looking for a friend who can commiserate and maybe join me. If you're in the same situation as me then we can scratch this itch!

I'm posting in platonic because I honestly really just want a friend, I'm seeking women because I feel like I can have a better friendship with a woman, especially one who is experiencing what I am. 

Also, I'm cool with just emailing, texting, IMing.

What better way to fill winter days than with some email exchanges with strangers. Sound like fun? Me too. First things first I dont live in your city or even your state, its easier that way, no worries from you that I'm your next door neighbor or a stalker. Everyone is happy.

So what am I looking to talk about? Anything and Everything. Life. Experiences. Interests. We can compare notes and see how life has been.

Traits that you may have that will make you a good match for me:
- Between the ages of 30 and 60
- Married
- Curious
- Non religious
- Intelligent
- Open Minded
- Likes asking and answering questions
- Mostly Positive about life (although plenty of sarcasm and knowing winks are welcome)

Dont decline to respond to this ad because you think I will have to many or be overwhelmed, in fact being as I am male this ad will mostly likely go not only unanswered but unread, but to you the potential reader of this who believes that there is still fun to be had by emailing strangers, please respond with at least 2 sentences and we can talk. It will be great. I promise.

I'm looking for a lady to smoke with.

I'm 6'4, fairly muscular, white, ddf, educated, employed, mobile, and would prefer to come to you or meet somewhere as my roommates aren't big herb fans.

If you're interested reply with a recent picture and I'll reciprocate.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Hello,
I am a Non-binary Genderfluid person and need a friend who can be there when I need them. Someone who I can talk to, someone I can hang out with, someone who will help me out if they can, and cares about my day. Someone who could understand what I'm going through is a plus. Or at least someone who can be sympathetic. 

I am currently homeless and staying with a friend temporarily. I have Aspergers and I don't drive, but do take the bus when I can. I have no job yet, and just so much else that is making things harder. But I need to be around people sometimes and I need someone who will notice when my smile doesn't quite reach my eyes. 

If you feel like you are someone who could do that, then please message me back.

Also anyone is welcome, you don't have to be trans* too.

I sometimes read about all the psychos, crazies, lunatics, liars, etc. ... that inhabit this board.

I just want to say that my experience has been far from this. I have found a number of women to be very intelligent and thoughtful in what they write. Some have had amazing life experiences that have given me new perspectives on things.

Many are able to deal with the complexities of life. Life is not simple, nor are there easy answers ... we are all here for different reasons and cannot be lumped into simple categories. Some see past age, politics, and religion and can try to understand other's as individuals. 

Many are kind and compassionate. They have offered me words of encouragement at hard times. 

I have been fortunate to meet in person with many and they are often great conversationalists and quick to listen. 

So thank you to all the women that act with respect here and challenge the notion that people on the CL boards must be a little crazy.

Just be comfortable with getting and giving a soothing, full-body massage with another guy. It would be nice to find someone able to get together every couple weeks or so. I'm not trained and you don't need to be either. Just have a pair of strong hands and reasonably decent massage skills. I think you'll find my massage skills more than adequate. I'm 52, 5'9"", 180, single, HWP and reasonably fit (I run a few times week), live downtown Mpls, can host and manage a fairly flexible schedule. For you, age is not really important, but please be HWP and send a pic. Nude pics not necessary, just a face and enough to see if you're someone I wouldn't mind putting my hands on. I'll send one back. Hit me up and we'll go from there.

You read correctly. What do I mean? We discuss and interact sensually without actual touching of the other person. That leaves everything else available. If you are interested or curious or both or even something else....WRITE!

Basic requirements and some about me for you to consider.

YOU would fit the following description, more or less.

1. 20's, 30's, young 40's. 
2. A BBW. This means many things to many people so it is almost useless. Plus some women are actually offended by the term. What do I mean? I mean you are built like a woman. You have curves, fat, yes fat, chubby tummy, any size breasts (NO BOOB ISSUES), large bottom, hips, basically you have a big butt...(think Queen's Fat Bottomed Girls, or ZZ Top 'She's got legs') don't know how else to say it. Sorry. Medium height. Brunette, brown eyes ONLY. White, fair skinned. Blushing and freckles get extra credit (what a jerk right, sorry). Anyway they are nice in my book. SMART. I love high intelligence. And when you think about it you need to be pretty smart to make what I am describing ....be attainable, i.e. platonic sensuality.
3. I think that covers it. We can discuss the rest. Reasonable? I think so. 

Me? Middle aged white male. Minnesotan. Educated. Better than average looking, actually most would rate me as attractive (but of course everyone has their preferences). Tall, nicely built, healthy, not insane. Professional degree and nice to be around. Personable, non threatening, non hostile, no diseases (but since it is platonic....not an issue anyway). Let's see, just about the nicest fella you will ever meet and for surely the sanest and safest you will ever meet meet on CL. 

For a LTR with regular platonic sensuality meetings. Think of it as taking a class as a continuing ed. student. The world is our oyster and we can discover much about ourselves thru the safety and encouragement of a nice fellow traveler.

Hello!

I used to be a fun guy -- I was out on Thursday/Friday nights, doing outdoors over the weekend, had a small but tight group of friends, watched movies, went to the concerts, road trips, camping, etc. etc. Then I married my girl (believing that the third long relationship must work), had a couple of kids, friends moved on, got promoted at work -- and now, I am an overworked, sleep deprived married man, trying to find balance between home and work life while trying to make everyone happy. My marriage has drifted into rough waters (and future doesn't look too bright -- but we are not giving up and keep fighting to save it), at work I am in that middle management role -not high enough to make the decisions and not powerful enough to get it done through my team either. 

Basically, life sucks right now and I don't want to just bitch about it. I would like to find a special 'friend' to talk to -- first via emails and eventually in person. My first thought was trying to talk to women at the gym or in grocery stores and I realized that's not a very bright idea - may have worked when I was single/younger but I don't have a good game anymore. My second thought was a friend's wife who is very touchy feely towards me when drunk but as much as I enjoy the fantasy, I know it is a really really bad idea and will certainly lead to big trouble. So, here I am on Craigslist. I responded to a few ads and didn't get a response (I am not going to attach a pic in my first email). 

Writing is not my forte and certainly not this type of writing. I read some other posts in men for women section and while I am no different from others in my search (married men looking for women to email or have affairs with), I don't think I quite belong here and this is likely as bad an idea as hoping to talk to women at the grocery store. Otherwise too, I know I am likely coming across a complainer and negative person (which I am actually not). 

Oh, the customary info on who am I -- I am 36, married, engineer, . . . as for how I look etc. it will be easier to just exchange pics (if someone responds and we get that far). You are 30-40, married, professional/educated, . . . open minded for this sort of thing :-)

Even after quitting smoking two years ago and going vegan almost 4 years ago, my skin still has a shit ton of clogged pores. No matter how many times I clean them out, they fill up again. I've tried to get my partner to help me out in places where I can't see or reach, but it's just not happening, hence this ad. Hoping to find someone who would like to do an extraction trade, with someone who's also condemed with shit skin like mine, like once a month, because spas piss me off and give me anxiety, nor do I want to ask friends because they all have clear skin, and so, here I am, on CL, looking for a self taught pore clearing master, who's confident af they'll rid my back, neck, sides of my face, shoulders and upper chest, like a SHORT NAILED BOSS and open-minded, because I'm not the type to shave my pits and legs during the winter and I would love to grow a real genuine friendship.

What I Have To Offer: Clean apartment by MCAD (sadly no pets). During the day, I can provide a well lit private porch, heated massage table, crockpots for washcloths so we each have our own (heated and ready to go), essential oils, gloves. 

You bring what you'll need: extraction tool, wash clothes, towel if you want to take a shower, sheet for table, clay mask, etc.). 

Please write back if you live in the area if this interests you. Thanks! 

LBGT/Trans friendly. Please correct me if I'm saying that wrong.

OK -- This ad is not for everyone and I admit, I am bad and I probably shouldn't be around here looking for women. I am married to a funny and beautiful woman, have two little kids, a decent job. . .life is good except I have a habit of wanting more. With the kids and busy life, there is not much time for intimacy at home and we always seem tired. Yes, I am trying to get the spark back at home but it is an uphill battle. I have been on and off CL for over a year and exchanged emails with a number of women -- I have been a confidant, a virtual lover/fuck body, a friend. . .but avoided meeting so far -- felt too much risk to my marriage. Well, there were barriers too -- either they lived an hour or more from me or some just wanted to keep it virtual. 

Now, I am back here hoping to find someone like-minded who would be willing to venture into more than an email fling. I am 39, hwp, 5'9"" -- 175 lbs. If you ever thought of cheating but were concerned about other things (risk to marriage, discretion, disease,...), I am the type of guy you want! I am posting this on platonic and not casual encounter section, because I want women like me who are like me (bad and may have cheated here and there before) and maybe looking for something long-term. 

Are you educated, smart, attractive, health conscious, 30-50 year old who may be interested in a secret lover? Tell me a bit about yourself, what part of the town do you live and let's explore.

Hi :) 

I am a very attractive/handsome, athletic (lifelong hockey player), fit, professional that will be in St. Paul/Arden Hills on Wednesday night and looking to see if there is anyone who would be interested in grabbing a drink and or dinner with me. It's rather boring being myself and I would enjoy some company and conversation with an attractive woman. No expectations what so ever. 

I actually come to Minneapolis every 2 to 3 weeks for days at a time. Would be nice to meet a sustainable friendship.

If you find a level of interest or curiousity, please reply and I will respond with a pic. 

To avoid spam or games, please put a random word or topic in the subject....

Warm regards (in light of the coming storm)

I have a gym membership with a free guest every day so you don't even even need to spend money of gym fees. Ideally i am looking for someone who knows more than i do about this stuff to help push me and help me shed some pounds. I am open to anyone who is willing to help. 

A bit about me, I am a 33 year old male, I am a big guy. (hence the gym) I am also a geek, keeping my eye on the pulse of a lot of pop culture. I love video games, super hero movies, horror movies, lots of different books and comics. I am educated and intelligent. Plus if you need your computer fixed I am your man. 

So lets do this and help each other get healthier.

I'm looking for someone that is in good shape and is confident . I am totally open to ethnicity. I have spent time a lot of timephotographing outdoors, landscapes, abandoned buildings.
I have spent very little time working on portrait photos or outdoor candid shots. I want to practice this and get better. This is not about shooting nudes. It's about finding the right person to model. The person that is willing to help me get better. What else it isn't, is me sharing the photos with anyone on the Internet. If you have past experience doing this I would welcome your input. I would like to find someone between the ages of 20 an 65. . I'm not going to say that I am locked into that age category, but it certainly covers a lot of people. Tattoos would be great. I can understand a woman's concern with doing this. If you are interest we can chat a bit and meet somewhere that you feel comfortable. The small details can be discussed when we meet. I am serious about this and am willing to share some of my past work to prove I am real. If a photo of me helps I am willing to provide you with one. If you are interested but still have questions for me, feel free to ask. Again, this is not about finding someone to photograph nude.

Here's what I am hoping to find. You will either think I am an ass or understand.
I am hoping to find a fun flirty woman that would like to have conversation and drinks/lunch with me tomorrow (Tuesday 2/2). It will be on me of course.

I am a 45 year old married guy and have the day available tomorrow and I have been wanting to kind of feel that someone was interested in me and possibly attracted or flirting with me? I am not looking for an affair or anything other than what I have listed above. Not really concerned about age or body type of looks....just the fact that you would be wanting to spend time with me would make you attractive to me.

I understand that there could be concern about safety...maybe you have a friend...more comfortable for you, double for me :)

I am real, safe sane and serious and hoping to find a fun flirty woman to spend an afternoon with.

Like I said, you will either get where I am coming from or think I am an ass and everyone gets to have their opinion.

I will respond to all who write to me.

Ill start by saying I'm not just looking to ""get high""; I have numerous chronic conditions that have been professionally diagnosed over the years, even though I'm fairly young (30). 

Without health insurance or a steady job, seeing specialists is impossible and seeing clinic doctors can be prohibitively expensive

Oftentimes, like right now for example, I am given meds that do not work for me, or that I don't like the side effects of. I usually keep them in case they can help someone else
Even if you just want to discuss living with pain, I can use friends who truly understand what this means.

If you are one, let's not connect. We will not find much hope in each other.

If you are an intelligent, attractive, married woman -- over fifty -- who appreciates down-to-earth, over pretense; let's talk. If intelligence is important to your passionate sharing -- but not simply to ""prove or demonstrate your intellect"" -- let's talk. 

If loneliness in marriage and a home life without passion, is weighing on you; let's talk. If you're seeking an attractive man, over fifty, who is in a similar situation; let's discover each other.

Intelligent intimacies. Rediscovered passions. Newly found soulfriends. Thoughtful explorations. I don't really need to explain more. If we're mirror-images, we'll know it quickly.

You are, is not spelled ur.

I workout at LTF on the South side of the metro. Usually working out daily (late afternoons) but everyone needs a day off here and there. 

I am at a spot where I need another guys help to move me to the next level. I have a decent body and my goal is to create a tighter stomach and build more muscle above the waist. 

I am getting bored at the gym, so that is why I am posting this ad. I am a gl professional gay man, so I don't mind the scenery, but that's not why I go to the gym. I am looking for another male that is focused on working out, who has knowledge in the gym, who can push me to another level, and is fun to look at. 

I love the outdoors, sports and being a clown, so a new friend would be great also. 

So, if your in shape and looking for a workout buddy who can make you laugh and not bad to look at, send me a message with your thoughts. One liners get deleted, just saying.

only problem is I don't have anyone to go with, and if I spend all of my time waiting around for friends to come with I might never ever go. I don't want to look back at some point and say.....""shoot...I wish I would have done those things I wanted to do""...

so anyways, I was thinking maybe...just MAYBE there may be someone out there in the same predicament as myself.....

I'm guessing that you are familiar with the classic Bill Murray film, ""Ground Hog Day."" 

I often feel that my life parallels the premise of the movie. I feel as if everyday is the same. As if a monotonous cycle simply happens over and over. Wash ... rinse ... repeat ...

Don't get me wrong, my life is wonderful in many aspects. It just lacks ... well ... I guess it lacks a sense of adventure. 

I am married and not looking to change that. I am financially stable, handsome, responsible, respectful, a great conversationalist, compassionate and an attentive listener.

I'm looking for someone in a similar position. You're cute, responsible, intelligent and have a lot going for you. Yet, you need more adventure. You're not looking for an ""affair"", but you do want to feel something inside your soul that has been missing. 

You are not looking for ""Mr. Right"" and certainly don't want to hurt those close to you, but you do want more than simply an email pal.

If you also feel that you are stuck in the Ground Hog Day cycle ... let's see if we can break out together.

Hello there, hope you're having a good day. Well, I am 39, and married. I am looking for a fun open minded woman to email or kik with. You can be any race, Any age, and any status. I am open minded, rarely get offended, and I don't judge others. I love to joke and be silly, I am respectful, and non pushy. I will admit I do love to flirt, and I've been known to push the boundaries lol, but I'll also respect your boundaries. My wife doesn't flirt, or chat fun or even naughty anymore and I guess I just miss having fun conversations, well, I do have pix, I'm not shy with them, but since I'm married I don't usually send them first.

I am a 62 year old man who is an avid hiker/backpacker/wilderness camper. I would like to link-up with a woman who would like to go on some wilderness adventures with me. Each year I go on two ""big"" wilderness adventures and several smaller ones. Last year my two ""big"" trips were to Zion National Park in Utah, and then to California where I climbed Mount Langley, a 14,000 foot mountain in the Sierra Nevada range. I also went on smaller trips to Tucson, the North Shore, and Red Rock outside of Las Vegas. I am not interested in a romantic or intimate relationship. I am seeking a physically fit adventurous female just because I have always gotten along well and developed excellent friendships with woman. This year I know I want to hike in the North Cascade National Park but before that, we could go on a couple day hikes to the North Shore just to see if we like one another before we plan on doing anything ""big"". Contact me and we can chat and then meet to see if this works for us.

O.K., here's the deal: I've determined that what women and men who are on this site - and particularly this category - are looking for two distinctly different things. Both are looking for the same thing, however: something that they are missing at home. Women are looking for lost conversation. We all know that as married life goes on, we tend to grow apart. Fact. Conversation gets more and more rare. Down to the bare-bones minimum to get by. It seems that women miss the day-to-day conversation that they once had from their partners - whether it be a husband or even a boyfriend. Your daily ""how was your day?"" and ""what are your dreams for the future?"" Am I right??? Women are just looking for someone they can chat about anything with; a true friend. Now, the flip side. Men. Men are also looking for what is gone in their relationship. Now once again, I am talking about the ""strictly platonic"" section and NOT the ""casual encounter"" section. Men who are truly looking for a ""hook-up"", sex, nsa, etc. are (should be!) posting/replying from the casual encounter section. I'm talking about men who are missing the sexy - NOT sex - side of things. Men here are looking for a woman to tease them, talk sexy, talk dirty, flirty, and fun. HOPING for some sexy pictures. Maybe even some real naughty ones. But NOT looking for a hook-up. And yes, I am one of those men. I want to ask you what panties you are wearing. I want to ask you questions about sex. What you like, what you don't like. What turns you on, what turns you off. So, with all THAT being said, here's what I propose to you: I'll give you what you want if you give me what I want. As you may have noticed, I can compose a sentence. I am intelligent, articulate, witty, sarcastic (in a fun way), playful, professional, and willing to engage. I can hold my end of a conversation; meaning I can both answer questions and ask them. You MUST be able to ask your own questions as well. Please re-read that last sentence. You will not get any ""one line"" responses from me. I am more than able to give you insights from a man's perspective on any subject. I - much like everyone else - have an opinion on everything! However, I also realize that my opinions are just that: my opinions. I am a firm believer in the saying ""Opinions are like assholes: everyone has one, and no one cares about anyone else's"". I am fairly non-judgemental. I would be more than happy to have sincere, everyday day-to-day conversation (what YOU need). In return, can you give me what I seek? Are you able to hold up your end of a conversation? Are you able to ASK YOUR OWN QUESTIONS?! Are YOU intelligent, articulate, witty, sarcastic (not mandatory!), playful, professional, and willing to engage? And, willing to include some photos? AND, willing to include some PHOTOS?! ;-)

I am a 49yo married white male. I am mostly looking for conversation via e-mail during the work-day to help my work days go by quicker. I sit in front of a computer all day. Maybe some evenings, too. If it should get to that...

I may be unhappy with my relationship, but I am NOT looking to change it in the near future.

If any of this sounds the slightest bit interesting to you, please send me a line...

I would love to hear from you.

Thank you for taking the time to read this entire ad!

I am solely looking for friends only. I am divorced with 2 kids that I only see every other weekend. I am finding the new single life to be challenging. I am also noticing that all my friends are married and hard to get together. I am single, so someone that is also looking for a wingman would be ideal to grab a beer and pick up some ladies. I am told that I look and act young. I don't smoke (anything) nor do drugs, but I like to go out, work out, and like most sports. I live in the west metro, but have a pretty dependable car that gets me wherever. If you find yourself in need of a new bro, send me a message.

So I'm home for the day. The place is quiet and I'm trying to decide what to do with my rare empty afternoon. Read? Work? Watch porn? Space out on YouTube? 
I can hear the highway in the distance, through the partially open sliding door. Other than the noise of it the day is extremely quiet and still. I might walk down to the river and watch the swans. 

So why am I here? What am I looking for? Shall I list a series of qualifications for you? Maybe some conversation starters? I suppose I could. Then we can talk about how you like this and I like that. Maybe it works but I've never experienced it. I could pour my heart out right here in an attempt to appeal to your sympathies but that's just silly. 

The reality is simple. This ad will soon be buried alive by the constant flow of ads posted by desperate guys on this site. It's all rather hopeless and depressing. 

I'll keep it simple to wrap this up. I'm not going to make any declarative statements here or put qualifications on anything. Maybe you're just bored. Maybe you resemble some giant lonely iceberg far out in the vast ocean, only a small part of you extending above the surface to be viewed by the world while the expansive unseen bulk of your true self remains hidden in darkness far beneath the surface.

Someone to chat with, text, or even go have beers with. I am super laid back and am really up for whatever. Let me know if you are interested.

I am 32 and a mom. Looking for new friends to go out to happy hour or bars with, or just hang out at home. Love wine night, bingo, karaoke, bowling, bars and small clubs. Looking for real girl friends that have substance as well. Pretty much looking for the whole package. A workout buddy would be great as well. I am short and of average build - trying to get down in size, tho! Im thick, but not fat. pretty petite(but thick compared to my former sz 1 build). Good looking, and it would be great to find the same. I dont take things too seriously, but am looking for someone genuine at the same time. I have a wild side, but put responsibility first. Looking for someone nearby to go out with on short notice, but am willing to look further in distance if you are the right fit. If we end up becoming true friends, then distance wont matter. You can always make things work if you really want to!

Color doesn't matter, but no thugs!!

Please send pic, age, location, and some info about yourself. Thanks!

I posted this a while ago and met a really cool lady (text). I was a jerk and stopped chatting with her. Maybe she will see this again. If not maybe someone new....

Hello. I could put the typical ""I can't believe I'm posting on craiglist"" line but let's be honest - I'm doing it. 

I'm lonely. I'm married but my wife seems to value her work, her exercising, her sleep, her personal time more than me. Yes we go on vacations, but at home - we are two strangers in the same bed (sometimes I just sleep on the basement couch - she does not care). Do I love her? Yes. Would I cheat on her just to feel wanted again....Frankly I'm beginning to wonder. I know it is a slippery slope. Still...I am a man and we men (regardless of what anyone says) are physical creatures....she hasn't touched me in months.

Is she cheating? No....she's too busy for that. Perhaps it is just to that point. 

Anyone care to chat? Will we ever meet - I don't know....but maybe you are ""in the same boat""

I understand this is a strictly platonic but the question is what does platonic mean. I'm not looking for a traditional relationship. I'm not even looking for sex necessarily. What I am looking for is a woman that I can start a friendly relationship with. Have lunch, dinner, talk etc. A real friendship. But I would love to see it progress to touching, kissing, flirting and whatever. No sex. So something more then what people consider platonic but something less then a hook up. I am missing affection and that level of intimacy. If you are too and understand what I'm saying please get back to me. I'm anxious to hear from you

I am looking for someone to grow a friendship with over time. Looking for someone who is very outgoing, energetic, and who likes to be adventerous. 

I am a 21 year old male who loves virtually all things outdoors, cooking, eating, and some light gaming. I am very happily engaged to the love of my life and I have absolutely no intent of changing that. I think that it is worth noting that I am not interested in online only friends and I see no reason to exchange pics in the first email. I am fairly athletic and would like to meet someone like me who is not fitness model level but rather someone who can hold their own on a hike. If you think that you have what it takes then shoot me an email telling me about yourself. As a side note I think that I should note that I am an excellent conversationalist all though I find online interactions to be a unique challenge.

Right. First off, I will just say that I am looking for e-mail buddies, maybe chatting on KIK or some other IM. I'm very skittish so I'm not looking for someone to meet up in person unless I get to know you for awhile and feel comfortable.
Second thing that you should know is that I'm transgender (this is a big part of why I'm skittish). So that's where I'd hope you'd be open-minded. 
I'm rather desperate for supportive and encouraging friends who will be positive and not pressuring about this. 

If that's all fine with you, read on and see if we have something in common!

Well, I have a lot of geeky interests. Comics and anime especially (I've gotten into cosplaying at conventions rather recently and would love to make more cosplay friends).
I like writing and drawing as well, and would reallllly love some more creative buddies to talk art or stories with. 
My musical tastes revolve mostly around heavy metal (though I like some EDM now and then too).
I also have a habit of doing roleplaying games (mostly online), D&D, stuff like that.

I like some more normal stuff too, like sports (hockey!), but those are pretty easy to find friends who are interested in them.


Please tell me a bit about yourself (age, interests, etc.) if you decide to reply.

Have a great day~!

I have been trying to figure out CL for the past few months and as I responded to ads and posted my own, I learned more about what I am looking for, what I can and can't do, and what is fun. Also, the best ads are the ones that can accurately describe what the person is looking for so I am feeling optimistic.

About me: I am a married man, 38, hwp/fit - life at home is good but not enough sex (many reasons - though not relevant here). Many find me attractive and I feel that I am skilled in the art of lovemaking but that said, I don't have a chiseled body or a huge cock. I have a very creative mind, and I am very sensual - and I love exploring fantasies. 

What I am looking: a woman who is open for discreet relationship. I am a bit of dominant type and I would like to be your only online lover. I am hoping we could build trust where we have exchanged pics and we know each other. We could potentially meet one day - I think that real possibility is a huge turn on. In fact, I would like to imagine that we could meet soon - even if we meet more as friends somewhere than lovers.

If you are submissive type, we could explore that fantasy where I will give you orders. I would like you to be educated and professional, able to articulate and express your desires through emails and photos - another huge turn on for me. You are between the ages of 30 and 45 - sane enough to pull this discreetly and crazy enough to go on this adventure with me. I am a romantic at heart and hope I could find a friend forever here from this ad. 

Ok - back to reality - this ad is probably not going to get a single response - so even if you are not the right woman for me, feel free to drop me a line what you like and what you don't.

I also geek on the Police a bit (listening to Don't stand so close to me as I write this). To look at me you wouldn't place me in this particular category. Truly, just after someone who gets it. Let's talk and see what kind of trouble we can get into shall we?

Hello Ladies,

So I am watching football all day today then working for an hour so I thought it would be great to have a late dinner/early breakfast with a nice and fun female in hopes of finding that special friend to spend time with and maybe spoil a little. If you are looking for a true and loyal friend please let me know.

Hi! I am a 23 year old younger man, looking for a little more substance in his life. I haven't had a lot of luck finding this in my own age group, but have many successful friendships and relationships with people in slightly older age groups. I'm not looking for someone to baby me, or mother me or anything weird like that. Just a friend to get coffee with or go for a walk/hike with from time to time. I'm new to the area, so if you can show me around, thats a plus! Not really looking for anything romantic necessarily, but am not opposed if we connect well. I am handsom-ish, with long hair and tattoos. I enjoy writing, being outdoors (especially in this nice chilly weather), playing guitar, and relaxing at home with my dog. If I sound like good company, let's meet up :)

I am very much aware of my psychological state and my physical health
And I could go on and on

Hey! Looking for easy going girl(s) - I have no drama and prefer the non drama out of touch types! Perhaps I sound like someone you'd want to get to know. 

Most of my friends are guys, needing some more girlfriends I guess lol.


I live out in Eden Prairie, so hopefully you're out west like Bloomington, Tonka, Chan, etc. Plymouth or St. Louis Park is okay. It just makes no sense if you live near Hudson or St. Paul so that'll it'll be easier to get together. 

I enjoy gaming when I'm also not working at the job I love...I play bass guitar, violin, mix, enjoy writing, love 89.3, The Killers and The War on Drugs, my favorite store is Microcenter but I'm into shopping too I just never get to go, I love exercising (HITT, running), and I have a dog that is my child. 

I go to Lifetime, any location. Mostly EP, crosstown, Chan. If you're not in shape or experienced with training, don't be intimated, I'd love to give you pointers or just do light workouts. It's so much more fun with a parnter! :)

Drinks out are fun too every once in a while, local or downtown. Going to the movies, snow boarding, skiing, ice skating, and concerts at smaller venues like the turf, first ave. 



Thanks!

OK ... let's get this out of the way now. While I don't think age, race, religion, height, weight and other such things matter since this is simply a friendship (not a romantic life commitment) ... many others do seem to be very concerned with such things.

Of course these are just numbers and tell you nothing about whether I am caring, intuitive, articulate, intelligent, or just plain fun to hang around. That you can find out if you respond and can get past the statistics.

Thanks for checking out my Ad. You are into my culture and I am into yours. You do not need to write me and overly-explain why you are into African American culture. If you are like me, you get tired of explaining to friends and loved ones about what and who you are into and Why! We are all into things & people we are into and thats it. We are who we are. I do not care what your job, relationship or living situation is. Thats your business and not mine...I do not judge people. I am not better than anyone else.

Another big plus if you are 'Attached' or in an Open relationship, and then we will have another thing in common to talk about it. Pretending they do not exist or count in a section of CL, does not make them go away. :-)

Obviously due to the nature of this Ad and the area of Craigslist it is, there is no need to send me a pic or description. I intrinsically am a guy who does not have a Type anways and I am not into body shaming.

Also feel free to read in between the lines of this AD if you are seeking something. We are all adults with needs in any section of CL, realistically.

Put your favorite coffeehouse, teahouse (not many in the Cities) or cafe in the subject line.

{NOTE: Please do not reply to my AD if you are ""too busy"", dealing with stigmas about talking to or meeting someone from online. Sorry I had to type this out but nowadays you have to be specific about what you want on CL ads}

Hello, thanks for reading. Yes, it's Craigslist, and let judgers judge, and haters hate, but at the end of the day, I have to believe that there are a few women out there in a similar position as me. Unhappy sexually and otherwise in their current marriage, and just looking for something discreet and exciting with someone ""on the side"". 

I am not what you'd expect to find on CL, and I would assume that if you are looking in this section, and are still reading, that you are not the typical CL hook-up either. At any rate, if you're interested and willing to take a chance, shoot me a note, and we can find out a little bit more about each other, and see if there is something there.

I am early 40's, very attractive, professional, very fit, and can hold a conversation 😁. PLEASE put ""I'm serious"" in your email reply subject field so that I do not delete your reply as spam

Or would it be Spousal-Attention-Deficit-Disorder? Hmm?

So why the ad you ask? Simple, I got to thinking that I might as well chat with others that feel the same way - that just don't get the attention they deserve from their SO. I have heard that this is a great place to look. Some say there are more than a few of us here.

I hope to hear back from someone who is inquisitive, open minded, educated, smart, well-read and yes, you guessed it - married. You should have a playful sense of humor, and a little sarcasm can go a long way as well. I am open to making new friends if nothing more. 

If you're interested in getting to know me, you would have to like good-looking guys that are smart and funny, have a lot of energy, honest (other than the obvious), confident, and have been known to be a little bit naughty. I have a nice smile, brown hair, blue eyes, I am 5' 10"" 180 lbs, I work out almost everyday and I think I look pretty good for an old guy (39)!

Tell me a bit about you, your looks (be as descriptive as you can), your situation. How long have you been married? How long have you been thinking about looking around? Have you done this before? What city do you live in? I understand the need for discretion, so if not the exact city, one that is near you. Also tell me something that I would find interesting about you.

I am available to chat over email most days while I am at work, and in the evenings after my wife and children have retired for the night. We are getting ahead of ourselves here, but I thought it should be mentioned that I am able to make myself available in the evenings when needed.

Let's get this party started!

Id like to meet someone who can start off as a friend and if it blooms into something more, great!! But if not, we still stay friends.. maybe it never gets to the romance point!

Or an activity partner? I would like to find someone interested in going for motorcycle rides, (Not Harley) Canoe the St Croix, or possibly hike the bluffs in Red Wing?

Many other things too. This is not code for anything. Just honesty looking for someone that enjoys being out. Appreciates company and conversation... No ajendas or expectations.

I'm a 28 year old guy into tickling, looking for men who like to get tickled. No sexual stuff. Just harmless (merciless) tickle fun.

So, to be clear: this is serious tickling.

If you wanted to do this, you'd be tickled to the point that you can't stand it anymore. And then tickled a bit (okay, probably a lot) more.

You know the spots: Feet. Armpits. Ribs. Hips. Yeah, all the usual spots. And yep, I'm totally serious. I have a ""thing"" (read: fetish) for tickling.

Again, there will be no sexual stuff, just tickling.

Sometimes the easiest things in life are the hardest to find.

What I am looking for is really quite simple. I am looking for someone that I can chat with throughout the day. Someone to get to know, someone to help the time pass by with and someone to talk to about whatever crosses our minds. This is strictly a platonic friendship that I am looking for.

I am happily married and don't have any kids. My wife works quite a bit including days, nights and weekends and therefore we don't get to talk that much when we are apart. I work a typical Monday through Friday day job. That is why I am looking for a new friend. This can be strictly an email/text thing or maybe we meet for coffee one day. The key is fun conversations.

I have many interests that include board games, bourbon, hiking, camping, Lego's, movies, going to the gym, reading about new topics, playing with my dogs, craft beer, projects around the house and lots of others. I am currently 33 years old. 

You can be in a relationship or single as long as it's strictly platonic between us. Race doesn't matter. Age would probably be best between 30-40 so that we will have some things in common though it isn't mandatory. Mostly I am looking for someone who can articulate their thoughts, have fun, be open and willing to step out on a limb and get to know someone. If you think that might be you then send me a message and tell me a little bit about yourself.

I hope you got to enjoy the gorgeous weekend we just had and that you have a fantastic day!

I do not care what your job, relationship or living situation is. Thats your business and not mine...I do not judge people. I am not better than anyone else.

Another big plus if you are 'Attached' or in an Open relationship, and then we will have another thing in common to talk about it. Pretending they do not exist or count in a section of CL, does not make them go away. :-)

Obviously due to the nature of this Ad and the area of Craigslist it is, there is no need to send me a pic or description. I intrinsically am a guy who does not have a Type anways and I am not into body shaming.

Also feel free to read in between the lines of this AD if you are seeking something. We are all adults with needs in any section of CL, realistically.

Put your favorite coffeehouse, teahouse (not many in the Cities) or cafe in the subject line.

{NOTE: Please do not reply to my AD if you are ""too busy"", dealing with stigmas about talking to or meeting someone from online. Sorry I had to type this out but nowadays you have to be specific about what you want on CL ads}
