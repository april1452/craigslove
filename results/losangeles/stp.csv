Friends first; lets get to know each other!!

I am looking to make new friends. Any good relationship starts out as friends first and in due time can evolve into a meaningful relationship. Someone who just wants to have a good time without pressure, be yourself and I will do the same. Personally I am an easy going, laid back can be funny as hell, very sarcastic and like to laugh rarely get stressed or become angry. I will make fun of you as well of myself. Life is short so I just like to enjoy the days as they go by. I will at times do random acts of kindness to others just to make myself feel better and to make our world a better place for all. As to what I like to do the laundry list can go on and on, but will try almost anything once. Some of the things I enjoy most are trying new restaurants (ethnic ones with a green B in the window) road trips speeding to our destination, the outdoors and cooking and yes I am a good cook. Quiet moments together just enjoying the company of one and other; lets not forget acting our shoe size not our age.

One thing that is very important to me is that you are an honest and real, a kind and caring person who speaks the truth. Someone who has feelings and is not afraid to express then, help each other out in both times of good and bad.I don't care what you do fore work or where you live or what you drive, just be a good hearted and a real person that hard to find this city we call home. Ideally I am looking for someone who is a least 35.

What I would like to get out of this post, is to make some new friends and maybe just maybe a best friend and a lover. Someone to grow old and grey and tooth-less with and have medacare buy us a pare of Hoverrounds.


If you have read everything I have written great. Because there is so much spam or BS on these listings I will only reply back if you answer a few basic questions in no particular order.

Where do you live, a zip code will work. Just want to make shore were both in the same time zone?

What decade where you born in?

Should I be a monkey suite or jeans and tee shirt person?

Are you just as happy eating at an ethnic restaurant with a green B in the window as you might be at a fine dining restaurant?

In all fairness hear are my answers to my questions.

Life is too short to waste it, so finding a friend is my goal, to share special moments and conversations, which may become endearing, captivating, adventurous and downright fun.
I want something deeper than just superficial intimacy. I want to connect on a level so few have had the privilege to achieve with that special friend. Finding someone to chat and share everyday things, talking about our life's journey and all the choices we've made good or bad. 
I don't know why certain people are placed in front of your path, coincidences, fate or sheer happenstance but nevertheless, everyone I have come into contact with have been cherished and beloved memories. Are you the one this post was meant for, I sure hope you are, I know you're out there? Age to me is just a number to me, I hope it holds no real significance for you either. I am able to relate to you whether your 21 or 55, having the confidence in my ability to engage in great conversations with you.
I dare you to find out if I'm what is needed, to help get you through a boring day. Remember we all need someone in our life's from time to time to make us feel alive.

Looking for over 38 something. I just can't get into hanging out with guys. So I live near the beach. I have my own place. I have a extra room and looking for a roommate (I'm not asking you to move in , just telling you about myself, hey want to move in?). I'm also looking for a platonic friend. I like non Hollywood blockbuster films. I like old classic movies. I like to cook and go out to eat, the full range of culinary delights. I'm very active and I'm really into lounging. I'll drink anything but moderately. Into casual beach cruising bike rides, I have an extra bike in the garage. I have tons of free time. A night owl by nature. Single never married no ex wife or kids. Average height, easy on the eyes, I clean up well, slim (not skinny) and very fit. I garden and like hanging out and in, going out finding place where there are no crowds. It's fun to find places where there is no competition for space. I'm open to get into what you are into. I'm up for learning the many things that I don't know. So in short I'm a fun and fit and active and I also like to be lazy, I'm a great catch but I'm looking for a platonic friend. Let's make plans for the weekend, let's get chummy. I will send my pic first if you like.

I'm looking for someone to do things with. I am married hence the platonic ad but an occasional hug when something happens worth hugging about is cool. My wife doesn't enjoy or have time for the things I enjoy so I thought I would find someone to do things with who does. I travel occasionally to Vegas, Reno, the SF Bay area among other places. Would like to get to Washington DC and Boston again too. I like to sightsee but it isn't much fun to do alone. It's more fun when there is someone I can share it with occasionally. Much more enjoyable when you can turn to someone and say ""Wow"" and discuss it. I drove to Rocky Mountain National Park which is at the peak of the mountains but when I got there, I sat a bit and then drove back down. Anyway, if you don't get it by now you better pass on by. Would also like to motorcycle up the coast so you have to fit on the back of a bike or have your own to share in that experience.

I'm in my 50's but age doesn't really matter. Just have to enjoy life. 6'4"" 265# Caucasian if that matters. Average looks at best and could stand to lose a few pounds or 20. 

If your interested in a new friend and an occasion adventure, please reply. We can text or talk and see if we have anything in common then go from there. If you send a picture I will reciprocate.
Please tell me about yourself and your ideas. So I know you read the post, please put Boston in response header.

I am an older bi guy who enjoys posing nude for others, and am offering to pose nude for student and amateur artists, either on a one-on-one basis (for another male or female) or for a small group (single sex or mixed sex). I am a regular, circumcised, Italian man ... I am heavyset ... 

I do not consider myself a professional model (though I have posed for a few pro artists in the past). I do not charge for students and amateurs. I am open minded, will do everything from classic to erotic poses ... am alright with the artist actually posing me ... you need not be a well accomplished artist. I am just as happy posing for someone who just wants to see if they can draw as I am with someone with proven skills. Oh yes, I am also willing to pose along with other models.

My availability is on most weekday mornings and some early afternoons.

Are you interested? If so, respond with some very basic information ... What is your status (student? Amateur? Artist? etc.) and what is the situation (one on one, small group, etc) and what type of art and how will it be used. When and how long will you need me? Where?.

I ask you provide as much information as possible as I do not appreciate one line responses and endless emails. If that is what I sense is happening, I will just not respond . the photograph with this posting is me....

I do hope to hear from you

How about an encouraging and uplifting conversation ... platonic, even sister/brother-like? Nothing nude (except maybe we bare our souls), and nothing inappropriate. Not expecting to meet in person, but yes to a meeting of minds and hearts.

If you genuinely want to talk about the important things in life - love, relationships, parenting, careers, faith, and others ... all those good things that make life worth living - then we should get along very well.

Maybe also talk about the joys or challenges we face -- in marriage or just life; how we are being stretched, possibly overwhelmed, how we have overcome, or how we are being overtaken ... with grief, with fear, with loss.

Professional, happily married, mostly sane, many interests, kids, like to encourage and build people up in their important relationships; maybe we can get some ideas to better love the people in our lives.

If this sounds interesting, let me know!

NOT looking for a date, a hookup, a relationship, or anything else. No expectations at all. I'm a good looking, in shape, professional guy, good hygiene, very easy to talk to and get along with, just interested in trying something like this once in my life.

This may sound like a very strange request, but I'm looking for a fit / attractive person who wants to cuddle, or hang out together in close proximity. 

Watch a movie, have a couple drinks, conversation (or no talking) and just relax. No expectations no pressure. Nothing sexual at all - really. I just miss human contact without it being in any way about sex. 

I'm settling back into LA after a couple years overseas. I work long hours with a very demanding job, and I don't have much of a social circle - and don't feel comfortable turning to a friend for this. 

I'm open to men or women - totally different dynamic with either. I'm the boss at work but want to just relaxing/melting with someone behind closed doors where I don't have to be in charge, which is why I'm open to male contact - if that makes sense. 

I'm very fit and an athlete (have attached a couple of body photos), good looking, educated and normal - a catch, if you will. Not bat shit crazy, down to earth white guy who isn't looking for anything jacked up. 

Open to younger or older, as long as you're fit, clean, reasonably attractive and aren't boring. I'm very optimistic and love to laugh, so a sense of humor goes a long way.

Drinks, food and/or movie is on me. Just be normal, cool and not a pro, please. Thanks.

What's up everyone? I am looking for some new friends to talk to and hopefully chill with. I am moving to LA from Chicago in July and would like to know some new bros there or someone to talk to about the city before i get there. I am looking for really any kind of person, ideally though I would like people close to my age. I like to smoke 4/20, explore the city, play videogames, and go biking. However I am very open minded so I am always down to try new things. I also like to give foot massages to people if they are down. I have received some training plus I just like doing it. If you aren't comfortable with that, I won't mind, its just a plus. If you think this all sounds chill, reply and we shall talk. Tell me a bit about yourself and please include age and a face pic also say in the reply if you are down for a foot rub or not. No age=No response. Hope to hear from you :)

I'm an Asian guy, and very Americanized. I'm just looking for a platonic friend. Age 30 to 40, but doesn't matter too much as long as you're mature. I'm not interested in going to clubs or anything too crazy. I live in the South Bay and work in Westwood, so I can hang out anywhere near those two spots. My intent is to just find a friend to hang out with, grab a bite to eat, see a movie, etc. More than anything, I just like good interesting conversation. I've tried this a number of times, and met some cool people, but it usually fades out for one reason or another... boyfriend, not interested, etc....which is perfectly fine. But, I want to keep trying to meet more people.

I'm korean but I don't speak Korean. I'm very Americanized, but I love asian food, so maybe we can drive to K-town, or San Gabriel valley?

I'm not looking for a relationship, so please keep that in mind. This is for just friendship. No sex, no dating, no expectations, keep it simple.

I'll keep this short for now. Tell me something, anything, about yourself.

I was listening the radio the other day and the host was saying of all the numbers in numerology
The number that might be the best compatibility predictor is your credit rating.

If you think about it...a credit rating certainly does say something for character.
Would you trust your life to someone with 550 credit rating over someone with a 750 rating?
In my life I've come to see people are a lot like their credit rating.
If you know how your credit number is compiled then you know...you don't have to have a lot of money to have great credit.

That being said...if your credit rating is north of 700
My guess is your a responsible person and someone I might like to meet.
I'm a good man, love the out doors, love being creative, I'm easy going and always up for a laugh
Looking to meet a cool, responsible new friend?
Don't be shy...say hi and include a pic

Have a fun day!

Do you love shopping? Do you wish you had someone along on your shopping excursions for an honest and discerning opinion? You know quite well that a shop keeper and store clerk tell you what you want to hear in order to make the sale. That's where I come in. I'm there to tell you what works and what doesn't, from a man's perspective.

I have been doing this for decades, accompanying women of all ages through malls and boutique districts, giving that much needed man's point of view, with a discerning eye that has worked in fashion, photography, and film. I am not a personal shopper, I am a shopping buddy, your style consultant there to help you look your best, give an honest opinion, and perhaps even save you money - because you know you have clothes in your closet with the tags still on that you will never, ever wear.

My rate is $125 an hour, and I will be that patient shopping friend you've been looking for.

Bonus - Relationship advice from that coveted guy's perspective is included.

If interested, please email your contact information, shopping plans; when and where, and send a photo of yourself in the mirror with the words ""Shopping buddy"" written on your hand for verification.

Thank you for your interest, and good shopping to you.

First off, to the person who wrote a lovely email about people here, I deleted your message. Please feel free to email again.
Greetings, G'day

Aussie Russian Frenchy here who is looking for a new pal. Hoping to meet someone for all sorts of endeavours from errands to walking and hiking to gaming to anything pals do. Someone to text/chat and later hang about with. I'm here for a few months helping a mate. I used to live in LA before though. Moved fro Australia age 13 and went to HS in Rancho. After HS I went back to Australia, France, UK and the PNW. Went back to UK and now here helping a mate. Close friends are far away and the loneliness is a bit of a drag. I'd want to meet new folks out and about but lately it's been pretty difficult for some reason. What the hell is it with people being so into themselves ey? Maybe it's just be but that is what I see. So I thought that I would give this a go even though I've tried making mates thru digital means only to end in weird failure. Flaky folks seemed to be the theme of the people I've chatted with. Right then, well I'm a good mate who believes friendship is something to cherish. In fact real friendship is bloody marvelous. I'm happy yet sad, you wouldn't know when the sad is about so don't worry if you think I'm a downer as I'm not. Rebel yet mellow, dark with light. I'm 29, athletic, sporting piercings, ink, and the attire ranges. I could be wearing a sport jacket with jeans or cargos, DCs, t and a hoodie (the norm for me). I travel heaps with a broad range of interests as well. As before I listed heaps of them here but now I will only name a few. Hiking, travel, listening to music (everything almost, from jazz and classical to the 70s, 80s and 90s punk. World tunes to electronica, indie, alternative, classic and modern rock etc etc blah blah) and creating it (love mixing eletronica and absolutely hate calling is EDM). I create electronica and love playing me didge, and piano. Vehicle related things as I'm a petrol head, being nostalgic, sitting on roofs, looking for E.T.s, chatting on about space, snow/skateboarding, reading, filming and photographing the world, helping folks and driving around listening to indie and going into your own world. Been a night owl lately so it can be a bit lonely. I'm looking for a good friend, easy as that, proud as punch. Not a friend on short term basis either. A friend for the ages. A GOOD MATE. Can't be to difficult to find that? I dunno perhaps it can.... Age range of friends is a pretty broad one. I know good people that I'm proud as punch to call mates ranging from 18 to 80s. If you're looking for a good friend as well, sit on a roof somewhere and just look at the view, talk and be proper mates, then please, send me a reply. Does not matter if you are tall short square round black white gay straight etc etc etc. Love ya all! I PREFER to chat thru kik, whatsapp, text or actual phone conversation and not so much email.. A few initial emails are OK however it seems that there are way too many flakes and bots thru email. Take care,
Ta!

Any open minded woman/man/couple with an extra or private room to share? If you're not open minded just go on to the next ad. I don't tell you how to live your life please don't tell me how to live mine.

I need a private room or space. 3-4 times a month to bring a friend for play, I'm an older bi male, good shape, easy going. I have a few friends that are good at massage and like to play. I also have done Tantric massage for over 20 years. You can be male or female, couple or T-girl, any age or race. and if you're really open minded you may be able to join us if you like.

I'm looking for an open minded person with extra space and will exchange somehow or is into joining us or can use a bit of extra cash every month. Just a few hours in the afternoon and not more than 2 -3 times a month. Probably just once or twice a month actually. 

To those who will tell me to just ""get a hotel or motel room"" If I could afford that I would do that, duh! Have you checked the prices of hotel or hotel rooms lately? 

I'm looking for someone that has the space, just a private room in a house even. You don't want a full time renter but you either need some repairs or minor work around the house or are horny at times yourself and would like to play also or just would like a little extra cash every month to let us use a room. I can pay up to one hundred dollars a month depending on the room and how available it would be. Needless to say I'm looking for a very clean room, and extra room in your house or even your own bedroom, house or apartment. I did this before and was offered some places I wouldn't let my dog sleep in. 

I'm a non smoker, only rare glass of wine and even rarer 420 friendly. DD free. Very clean easy going, nice responsible older bi man. 

If you don't need the cash but have the space and don't mind my using it we can come to some other barter arrangement. I'm very handy and very open minded. 

If you reply please let me know in the first email where you are located. I'd prefer Valencia, Castaic, Stevenson Ranch or Sylmar area but a little further into the valley may be OK.

Like I said I've done this before so NO one liners, asking me to verify myself or sending me to another email address in your first email. But DO let me know where you are located in the first email. Thanks

Hello, 

I am looking for someone to workout with so I can get back in shape. I find it hard to workout sometimes when I'm unmotivated, but I figure if I had a workout buddy to meet and we motivate each other, I'd be more inclined. I have a 24 hour fitness membership and a bike. I would like to have someone to hit the gym, hiking, beach workout, or bike trails with... I'm also open to other workout ideas. If you are trying to workout also, and need motivation, maybe we can motivate each other. I'm hoping you live semi-close so it's not a hassle to meetup when we work out. Again, I'm only looking for a workout buddy. So, with that being said if this sounds like something that could work for you, let me know. I don't care what you look like, I just want someone to workout with and be dedicated. Thanks for reading and I hope to hear from you.

Hello
How are we today?
Happy Internation womens day

Well mine is up to a lazy start.

Let's get started before I completely start rambling on,
I am in search for a friend; someone who I can share anything with without judgment and vise-versa. Someone around my age (21-27) since I am 25. Someone just to have fun with and have a great time.
I am a bit of a geek so someone in that human spectrum of geekiness.
I am not looking for a relationship but I am not opposed to a relationship if the chemistry is there; but again mainly looking for a friend and that is the main priority.

A bit about me
Like I said I am 25. I live in Los Angeles (You can ask me where exactly when you answer the post lol). Again I am a bit of a geek and like comics, movies, shows, music, video games. On my free time I love to take pictures of random things, I like to read and play my guitar. Oh almost forgot I love to travel haha seen many places around the world but still have to see much much more. I am a big boy I do have a job.

I will leave it as it is so we can have something to talk about.
I am an opeminded person. When you answer you can ask me anything you would like to know about me and I will most likely respond honestly. By most likely I mean that I won't be giving out ultra super secret information lol

Well that being said If you guys have a kik and decide to answer you guys can reach my kik at jondoe297.
And you guys answer via email please put your favorite character as the subject, a bit about yourself an a picture would hurt. I am not shallow but would like to know who I am talking to. In return to your generosity I will also send a picture.

Haha thank you for your time reading this and hope to hear from you soon.

Would be best for both of us if you did too. I'm spontaneous and love a good adventure. I rarely say no lol... ok, I do a lot but not with the cool stuff lol.
I don't know what else to write, this is like dating without the dating part lol. If your looking for a kind of shy, kind of out there girl to hang with then please, say hello. Tell me something about yourself. A pic could be nice to put your words to. To those of you who think we just wouldn't click, good luck on your journey..

Anyway, I would like to expand my circle of friends, and hopefully incorporate fellow otaku(s). 

I do hope you're drug free, because I don't smoke, nor drink and have far better ""use"" of my time. I would prefer others with stimulating conversation. Nothing worse than conversing with someone who is rather dull, and empty in mind. Also, I'm 25, and female as well. I don't care about your racial background, nor sexual orientation!

I was wondering if there were still persons out there that miss writing to someone. I understand that in today's society time is more valuable. So I won't take up too much of your time, what I am looking for is a woman to write to, get to know. If we have a human connection then we can text and talk on the phone. 

Do you have the imagination and the desire to engage in what may be some of the most interesting and tantalizing conversation you have had in a while? Let's explore the world of words put in such a way that brings images to mind that feel so real, so vivid and floods all your senses. 

I miss having my phone make that beautiful noise of notifying me that I have a message, text or email, how my heart races and my breath quickens in that split second when I look down and see your name, giving me another reason for carrying my phone. 

I don't mind if you're married, in a relationship or single, just have a beautiful personality, great outlook on life and not be hung up on looks or age. I am not here to promise or pretend to be something I'm not, I'm just a man that seeks a connection with a special someone, that's all. I am married, so this would only be for friendship.

I shall do my best to captivate your mind and excite your synapses, igniting a flurry of electrical and chemical sensations within your brain and maybe, just maybe some wonderful memories.

Do you ever find yourself lonely, bored, needing help with starting basic tasks/chores, some simple motivation, assistance with finishing or getting projects started, want someone to watch TV shows with, or accompany you to the movies, go hiking, have breakfast/lunch/dinners with, or simply just being there for you as a friend?

Then look no further, I am that ideal person you have been searching for, here to help you fill the void in your life.

I can be there for you as a friend, listen to your problems, help you shop, style you, give you motivation, assist you with challenging tasks, give you clarity, exercise with you, help you with meals (and dieting), give you advice, help boost your self-esteem, organize your goals and schedules. . .pretty much anything. But most of all, I will be there for you as a friend.

I also specialize in helping people with special issues, such as: addiction (have worked as sober companion), depression, and anxiety.

I have privately helped a roster of clients throughout the years. Ranging from discrete elite, to middle-class individuals - all walks of life. Each person I have worked with has been unique in their own way, but one thing they all had in common was their positive feedback they shared with me, about how I was such a supportive encouragement in their lives. Many have said I helped them survive their darkest times, and have left them with a new outlook on life. Whether it was only a few months or several years, my friendship to them helped encourage them and brought positive change to their lives.

I am a young guy, in my late 20's, living near the West Hollywood area. I have degrees in psychology and counseling, with years of experience working with a wide variety of individuals.
I am very chill/laid-back, easy to talk to, thoughtful, empathetic, compassionate, and considerate person. I take great joy/fulfillment in helping others, by being a genuine friend. I know life is tough, and sometimes it may seem like no one is really there to care or help, but I am. It is my goal to make your life easier, help you smile/laugh, give you entertainment, something to look forward to, but most importantly, to be your friend. I am also great with pets too.

If I sound like someone that could be of help to you, please contact me and we will set up a meeting. My rates are very affordable, but can vary. I typically charge around $25 an hour, but under certain circumstances, adjustments can be made. 

I look forward to helping you!

I am a south bay surfer, who typically is in the ocean early mornings. I will occasionally go after work, pending how the surf is. I am looking for a reliable surfing companion, who wants to join me. Your skill level, looks, race and weight do not matter at all. If you want to learn, I can teach you. If you know how but need some additional pointers, I can help you. I used to be a surf teacher, and I am a really good teacher. If you are a good surfer and just looking for someone reliable then I am your man. 

All I ask if please be drama free, you can pour your heart out to issues you are going through. But do not cause me drama, or be dramatic. There is a big difference from listening to ones issues, and causing issues for that person. So please be drama free, kind hearted reliable and sane that is all that I ask.

Now I am looking for women, because frankly I enjoy female company more them men in the surf. A lot of surfers think they are alpha males when they are as far from Alpha as you can get. And I am there to be in touch with nature and my surroundings. Not to listen to some a wall roid freak ruin the spirits of surfing. So if you are a guy, and know the true meaning of surfing then please feel free to message me. But if you are one of the MANY typical dipshits out in the water, and try and pull any of that crap on me. Be prepared to throw down, because I do not tolerate that crap in the water.

Life feels pretty lonely right now. I'm pretty confused about relationships. I guess you could say I am even pretty confused about life. I would love to have a friend to distract my mind from the past. The ideal situation would be to develop a really cool friendship with you and if we develop a strong bond to evolve into a relationship. I love women. I love being around you, watching your feminine ways, the way you smell, your girlyness, there really isn't anything about a woman that I don't like. 
I guess the only thing I am not attracted to is dishonesty, and unfaithfulness. Of course we don't need to worry about the whole unfaithfulness thing since we are just going to be friends. And I don't mean fuck buddies either. That whole fuck buddy thing is just to modern and liberal for me. 
I am pretty educated, not a genius, and not an idiot. I love to learn new things. I love camping, going bike riding, jogging, going to the beach, writing, listening to music, and talking. Don't worry I also love to listen. It's a beautiful thing when someone opens up to you.
If I sound like someone you would like to be friends with please reach out. Maybe we can make each others lives more complete and fulfilling.

Don't have a man in your life? Of course you don't otherwise you wouldn't be reading this. Tired of spending evenings and the weekends alone while your friends are with their boy friends or husbands? Don't have anyone to spend time with or cuddle up with under a blanket to watch a movie with? Tired of dating players or guys that don't want a relationship? Well maybe we can help each other. 

I am an up front honest guy. Very sincere, very loyal, and very loving. I'm 28. Tall, Dark, Handsome, and Educated. A woman doesn't have to have model looks for me to be attracted to her but she needs to be height/weight proportionate. 

I am a very monogamous man as I typically only even date one woman at a time let alone sleep with more then one woman. I am relationship oriented but am open to being casual. 

I am looking to find a special woman that I connect with on an emotional, intellectual, and physical level. Someone who is highly intelligent, active, and passionate as well as genuine and sincere. Someone who loves to make me feel like a man as much as I love to make her feel like a woman. 
Someone who believes in me, supports me, yet is honest with me because I am not perfect. The woman I find has always been out there, I just haven't been lucky enough to find her yet. Not only will we be passionate lovers and share a deep intimate connection, most importantly we will be best friends. She will be the last thing I see when I go to bed at night and the first thing I see when I wake in the morning. The question is, are you her?

So I am tired of driving an hour to see my friends, or waiting an hour for them to come see me.It's annoying.

I would love if there was someone in the Beverly Hills area, where I live, who would like to become friends. Going out to all the great restaurants on the westside, walks in the park, workout buddy, walking buddy,watch movies together. Stuff like that.
Please don't be, oh how do they call it, a psycho! That would be great.
But please be energetic, talkative, and have a wonderful sense of humor as I do.

Summer is here, We can have a great time together as friends!

I have a very comfortable motorcycle and a pair of matching full-coverage helmets with bluetooth intercoms so we can actually chat while cruising through the beautiful scenery! I even have a small BLJ (black leather jacket) you can use!

This is not for romance or sex, but for friendship and a companion on rides coming up this spring. Hey--if we hit it off and something ""more"" happens, all the better! But no expectations. Just riding, dining at hidden little roadside cafés, etc.

I will answer all genuine replies. Please write an intelligent email, tell me about yourself a bit and send a pic or two. Please put ""LET'S RIDE!"" in the subject line.

Hello, I got a great sofa using craigslist so why not someone to just talk to! (preferably skype/kik) anonymous connection, I won't know you from personal details, and back. We can just virtually hang out, tell me about what's bugging you, or I'll talk to you about a very weird movie I've seen, or discuss how good steaks are and how McDonald fries are still the best. Do you like mountain climbing, or racing? I do too, but heights and unmanageable speeds are still scary. 

We can talk about our daily lives, recent problems, achievements, fetishes (can be se.xual), procrastination, and anything. The point of this is just to have someone to listen or talk with because we're all stuck, or are in circles, sleeping under a busy crazy world, or stuck in the endless cycle of the day job, maybe under a busy city that never sleeps or just a lowly countryside. Whichever way, let me know, maybe we can be great anonymous penpals.

My birth year: 1990. Getting out from a conservative Asian background. I feel old... It's like I am stuck, I can't rev up the jeep, and things are in circles. I still have no idea what to do, and I am trying to figure it out, how about you?

myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.
Jane Fall. Feminism is a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave
their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.
Pat Robertson-right wing Christian evangelist. A woman reading Playboy feels like a Jew reading a
Nazi manual. Gloria Steinem. The more famous and powerful I get, the more power I have to hurt
men. Men use the night to erase us. Stella Adler. We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by
feminists who are anxious to force us to regard the sexes as completely equal in portion and worth.
Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

Hello. I'm a college student and i work. Looking for someone to talk to throughout the day or hang out with when we're both free. I tend to stay up late so night owls are welcomed lol. I'm 21, black, curvy body, 5'7, drama free, open minded, fun, laid back, etc. I like watching movies, trying different food places, drinking here and there. 420 friendly but haven't done it in forever and don't smoke cigs. I like going to the beach, six flags, or to the park to play basketball. I'm mainly looking for new people to talk to and get to know (friends). If it leads to something more serious, than i would like that but no pressure lol.. I'm open to all races and ages, just no one over 36. And if you're taken or married don't talk to me please. Anyways, hit me up if you'd like. We can email or kik or text if the convo goes well. Not putting a pic on here but will send one eventually. You can send one if you'd like.

What's up guys, I'm creating this post in hopes of connecting with some other like-minded individuals (or maybe not, if you want to debate with someone with differing perspectives i'm down) that are interested in general intellectual progressivism, but specifically participate in or are interested in the fields of or related to: Atheism, Anti-Theism, Anarchism, Anarcho-Syndicalism, Altruism/Selflessness, Existentialism, Existential Nihilism, Philosophy, Veganism, Human Rights, Animal Rights, (Actual) Feminism, Pacifism, Ecologism, Anti-Establishment/Corporatism/Capitalism, basic equality, and generally changing the way we see things... 
These are the main causes I can think of off the top of my head, so really people who are open-minded, kind, displeased with popular American/national outlook and sociopolitical norms, displeased with current political state, and interested in seeking truth and the best answers through reasoning and rational thinking.
People with philosophical ideas based in rationale and possibly pursuing writing on these subjects.
People that are focused in socialism, communism, Marxism and other forms of government and economic policy i'd like to talk to too. Especially cool if you have or plan on taking direct action to combat problems.

Not sure if craigslist is really the place to look for people like this lol, but it seems the only other places would be punk concerts and universities, which are both easily hit or miss situations... And vegan restaurants too would work. I guess.
I'm also interested in art: 2d, sculpture, music, film, street art, tagging. My favorite music genres are sludgecore, crust punk, powerviolence, anarcho-punk, doom metal, conscious and hardcore hip-hop, reggae, soul, indie and a lot more, genres related to these I probably like. Pretty depressed music and movies are my favorites: City of God, Gummo, Kids, gang movies. Emotional, meaningful art of all kinds I'd likely enjoy.

As of now I want to establish a base so maybe in the future, friendships, possibly art collectives, housing co-ops, or other stuff can bud from this... I honestly don't know... 
So, if you're interested in any of these things, hit me up at my cell, texting's cool but if you can't I'll probably answer a call. We could talk over text or online or meet in person. I live in the 562 area but I can probably travel. If you email me put CRAIGSLIST in the Subject please, my email is oversaturated with notifications.
show contact info

(I'll link my FB to people interested)
You don't eally have to be into any of these though of you feel we could still be cool. These really just set a preliminary barrier.

If you think any of these things are cool, don't hesitate to hit me up.

I am friends with and come across many different ""walks of life"" especially in my job. I do not however know anything about the celebrity world. I'm just curious to talk to someone that works in this type of business. Coffee, emailing, texting, a new friendship, I'm open to whatever. I don't even have to know you ID if you feel like just having a anonymous texting friend to converse with. I don't want to use you, I don't want your fame, your money, dirt for TMZ, or use you for my own agenda. I just want to get to know someone in this world that is very different than my own. In return I offer a perspective possibly a little more ""down to earth"" that what you might be used to. I'm very grounded, I have my life pretty well together, and feel like I have a very realistic perspective on the world. I'm just interested in meeting someone different and form interesting conversations out of it. I actually don't even live in the LA area but i visit fairly often if that makes a difference.

If you're reading this, perhaps the nature of the title drew you in. I will be upfront in that I'm not looking for anything other than genuine connection. Why I'm posting here, I can't exactly say. Maybe a bit optimistic? Maybe a bit crazy? Yeah, perhaps just the right amount of both.

I'm in my early 30s, and while I'm generally quite content and satisfied and (insert whatever bullshit positive-sounding adjective you want), I'm very much a restless soul at heart, but I keep that well hidden, I believe. I've had my ups, perhaps more than most, and I've had my downs, and quite frankly, I have no desire to reach out just for the sake of reaching out. I have zero interest in games and fluff. 

The more I type, the less inclined I am to to drone on and on. I feel like if you're even mildly interested to converse further at this point, you'll shoot me an email and we'll go from there. I'm no open book by any means, but what I am is genuine and fully disclosing to those who earn my trust. To get at least the tip of the inevitable superficialities outta the way, yes, I am active and do take care of myself (but yeah, of course the semi-regular porkout happens, more often than I'll admit in such a generic post, ya nosy bastard), so it'll probably be beneficial if you're of a somewhat similar ilk. No, I don't give a rat's ass about your race or age, as far as assigning ""value.""

Hope to hear from you if you're intrigued enough to start meaningful dialogue. Because ultimately, what the hell else is life even about?

Hello!
I'll be traveling to Honolulu Hawaii in May and looking for someone to go with. I'm recently separated and looking to just get away from it all and enjoy the beautiful island. I'll be paying for myself and my travel buddy would take care of their own expenses. Separate rooms, etc but flight if coming from LAX we could go together. Would love to have a buddy to sight see and do activities with. I am in NO way looking to hook up, date, etc. Pina colada and beach, sight seeing, etc. Just a friend to travel with, my preference is another woman but would be open to a male as long as they understand that it is strictly platonic. A gay guy would be great!! The trip will likely be around 2k with fight, hotel, activities, dinners, etc.

Friends first; lets get to know each other!!

I am looking to make new friends. Any good relationship starts out as friends first and in due time can evolve into a meaningful relationship. Someone who just wants to have a good time without pressure, be yourself and I will do the same. Personally I am an easy going, laid back can be funny as hell, very sarcastic and like to laugh rarely get stressed or become angry. I will make fun of you as well of myself. Life is short so I just like to enjoy the days as they go by. I will at times do random acts of kindness to others just to make myself feel better and to make our world a better place for all. As to what I like to do the laundry list can go on and on, but will try almost anything once. Some of the things I enjoy most are trying new restaurants (ethnic ones with a green B in the window) road trips speeding to our destination, the outdoors and cooking and yes I am a good cook. Quiet moments together just enjoying the company of one and other; lets not forget acting our shoe size not our age.

One thing that is very important to me is that you are an honest and real, a kind and caring person who speaks the truth. Someone who has feelings and is not afraid to express then, help each other out in both times of good and bad.I don't care what you do fore work or where you live or what you drive, just be a good hearted and a real person that hard to find this city we call home. Ideally I am looking for someone who is a least 35.

What I would like to get out of this post, is to make some new friends and maybe just maybe a best friend and a lover. Someone to grow old and grey and tooth-less with and have medacare buy us a pare of Hoverrounds.


If you have read everything I have written great. Because there is so much spam or BS on these listings I will only reply back if you answer a few basic questions in no particular order.

Where do you live, a zip code will work. Just want to make shore were both in the same time zone?

What decade where you born in?

Should I be a monkey suite or jeans and tee shirt person?

Are you just as happy eating at an ethnic restaurant with a green B in the window as you might be at a fine dining restaurant?

In all fairness hear are my answers to my questions.

straight athlete here, seeking a photographer who would be willing to do some free photos of me in exchange for practice for you and I can do any photos you want to try.

If you are up for an evening of a drink and chill to talk about it and experiment with them, send a photo and some about you over and I'll get back. Please be a normal SANE down to earth person or don't respond.

Hi, I'm a photography student who wants to gain more experience doing portraits (mostly natural light), and I'm looking for someone to be my model. Nudity is not required but might be a possibility if you are open to it.

Please be comfortable having your photo taken and have an interesting face and /or body. All ages, ethnicities welcome - Latino, Armenian, white, black, Asian, etc. If you are photogenic that would be a plus! If you have a backstory (actor, athlete, uniform, etc.). that could be incorporated into the portrait, that would be even better. 

What's in it for you? I will trade photo files for your time. If you are an actor or model who wants to add to your portfolio, I'm happy to give you any photos you like. I can also spring for a coffee or two, but that's about it right now!

If you are interested, hit me up with any questions you might have. The next step would be to set up a meeting (at Starbucks, etc.) to chat and see if it will work for both of us. 

Thanks for reading.

You are a point of view of supreme consciousness.
We are all different points of view of Supreme consciousness.
We are all the same Supreme consciousness in our original state of being.

I have written and discussed material on:

Death is an illusion
The Trinity
Dreams
Magic
Annunaki and the Summerians
How to defeat the Global elites
Truth about Dinosaurs
The subconscious mind
The time track of a spiritual being
Past lives
Architects of religion on Earth
Creation of homosapiens in Earth
Ufo,s
Nazis on the moon
Our history on Mars
The galactic confederation

My friends now are urging me to teach.
To make an income that would allow me to take time off from Carpentry to awaken others.

An old man once approched me and prophesized that i would sacrifice my own personal love for love of mankind.
Maybe this is part of it.

I'm looking to charge an affordable fee for a session to see if it's something you'd be interested in.

I'm looking to build a clientele of people i can share knowledge and one on one phone coaching. I can cover anything one desires to talk about.

I will teach you a simple technique that will help to let you know if you are making the right decision on anything.

I'm hoping to hear from you....
Even if you have questions that i can answer through email for you.
Can be about anything. I will show you i mean business.

Thanks for your time....

You are a point of view of supreme consciousness.
We are all different points of view of Supreme consciousness.
We are all the same Supreme consciousness in our original state of being.

I have written and discussed material on:

Death is an illusion
The Trinity
Dreams
Magic
Annunaki and the Summerians
How to defeat the Global elites
Truth about Dinosaurs
The subconscious mind
The time track of a spiritual being
Past lives
Architects of religion on Earth
Creation of homosapiens in Earth
Ufo,s
Nazis on the moon
Our history on Mars
The galactic confederation

My friends now are urging me to teach.
To make an income that would allow me to take time off from Carpentry to awaken others.

An old man once approched me and prophesized that i would sacrifice my own personal love for love of mankind.
Maybe this is part of it.

I'm looking to charge an affordable fee for a session to see if it's something you'd be interested in.

I'm looking to build a clientele of people i can share knowledge and one on one phone coaching. I can cover anything one desires to talk about.

I will teach you a simple technique that will help to let you know if you are making the right decision on anything.

I'm hoping to hear from you....
Even if you have questions that i can answer through email for you.
Can be about anything. I will show you i mean business.

Thanks for your time....

Mars

We are a monogamous gay couple in our fifties that have been happily together for many years. We are looking to meet other gay couples that are interested in developing a platonic (non-sexual) friendship, based on our common interests. We enjoy conversation and just hanging out, dining out (our favorites are Indian, Italian, Persian, Mexican, Middle-Eastern, Thai, and Chinese food), board games, amusement parks, some hiking, the occasional night out dancing, movies, science fiction, fantasy, comics, and trips up the beautiful California coast. We are clean, polite, caring, non-pretentious, easy going, and have a sense of humor . We are looking for the same. We don't smoke or use drugs, and prefer the same, so if you or you partner light up frequently, we are probably not a good match. And even though we both love animals, one of us is allergic to cats, so no cats please. So, if you are a gay couple and are looking to meet some new friends for the New Year, please contact us!

As I get older (42), it can be harder to feel attractive and wanted. I work out very hard to maintain my shape and would love to have someone to simply talk to that understands how it feels to be in this situation. However, because I'm in a relationship, there might not be times I can answer. 

I'm attractive, confident, I'm in great shape/athletic, I'm outgoing, I can carry a conversation/make people laugh, be the life of a party, considerate to others, I dress well, and have a good job.

I like to workout, go out, visit Disneyland (annual pass), hiking, video games, and much more.

There's just that part in my life that doesn't feel I get the attention I deserve for my hard efforts. Does this sound like you at times? Do you need to vent? Express how it feels? Perhaps even seek motivation to keep in shape?

Hi,

I am a single mom and I have two kids that are 19 and 15, both of whom live at home with me full time. We love to go out and do things as a family, in the past my sister lived nearby, or we had another family or close friends around and we loved getting together with them and hanging out, however many of our friends have moved away and we get tired of looking at only each other. LOL

Some things we might like to do, go on a camping trip (we are seasoned campers and hikers). OR go to a ball game, or hang out at the beach. We might like to go bowling, play paintball or go mini-golfing. We might like to do a movie night, or a game night. How about a BBQ or pizza night. A game of Crazy Eights? Maybe we could go to the archery range. We even like the zoo, museums and other educational things. Sometimes we like to go to yard sales and farmer's markets. Last Friday night we went to watch the filming of America's Got Talent. (well we did that with friends, but still you could have come)

I think you get the idea. This would be for friends. I would like to meet you (the adult) first and see if we think hanging out with the kiddos would be fun and go from there. 

We do not care about race, or what not. We are looking for people like us that want more friends and love having little adventures. If you have teenagers, great, but open to any age.

Looking for a girl to talk with and share experiences. Just recently got out of a 4 year relationship that's left me a little emotionally scarred, hoping to find someone who can help me forget, who can tell me they have felt a similar pain, who can say to me ""Let's start over."" As far as I know we're each only given one chance to be human and experience all it has to offer, Sorrow is one experience I now know but I don't want to waste all my time on that. 
I want have that feeling of being connected to another human being again. I won't lie I am in my own way a dark deviant yet there was some one who fell in love with that part of me so perhaps...maybe... 
Hope to hear from 'you' whoever you maybe be no matter how flawed.


p.s. I am not looking for anything sexual, I'm a broken person who's capable of fucking someone I'm actually in love with.

    Not sure how to start this. I'm 32 years old, nice, mellow and sincere. I can be a bit on the shy and quiet side until getting to know people better. I like going to the movies, tv, documentaries, listening to music, board/card/video games, hiking, museums, learning new things, eating out, the beach... I would describe myself as a buddy type because I usually let my friends take the lead and like helping out with stuff. Well if you would like to know anything else or talk and see if we would be good friends, drop me a line.

I used to make a living as a massage therapist, and after being single for a while, I find myself wanting to return to the sensual massage with a beautiful woman like I used to give a girlfriend. I'm still as skilled as ever, and promise to give you a great, therapeutic massage. I have a massage table, oil, candles, and everything to make it perfect.

I can also assure you that you will love the sensual touch I will bring to it. Your comfort is most important to me, so you set the limits. To give you an idea of the sensual massage, I will touch you in a way that will excite you to no end, and bring you to climax in whatever way you would like. If you're comfortable with it, I will be nude during the massage, and I welcome you to touch me anywhere you like. Another promise I can make is that you will be very happy to find how well endowed I am. 

I am not asking for a fee for my massage. The pleasure we both will get is more than enough.

About me - I'm white, tall, thin, clean cut, attractive, intelligent, and very kind. I'm happy to send pictures if you are.

Hope to hear from you soon.

I am a musician, American born and raised with strong roots, latin male. I play guitar professionally, all styles (mostly metal and indie rock). Music is my life so If you are into the music scene or you just like to go to clubs to see live music that's a big plus. This ad is for friendship and fun. I am Spanish with some Italian and was born and raised here in California!

I'm late 40's, have S&P long rocker hair, metal style and a crazy metal beard, but can switch looks and style for any occasion, easy on the eyes. Many of my friends are in their 20's, so if you're young we can still kick it, because I'm not some creep, I'm just older. I play guitar and produce music. I haven't subscribed to the whole ""act your age"" thing. Music scene and performing keep me young. I play metal and progressive rock so if you are into metal and or good classic rock that would be awesome! Concerts!

THIS IS ALL ABOUT FUN!! LET'S HAVE SOME! There's enough boring people around. 

Anyways, I like to kick it with white girls. I like to go to live music shows, and sometimes just want a nice white woman to accompany me. This is platonic, but who knows, maybe more if chemistry is right. FWB? Maybe just good friends, either way I respect boundaries, and I keep it real. I'm not some hard up lamer. That's why I posted here in the platonic section. But if we are attracted to each other there's nothing wrong with that. I'm open for romance also, haha, yeah right, like that's going to happen at my age! :(

I like fair skin and smart conversation. You are an open minded woman who isn't hung up on race, or the role that your peers expect you to fulfill. You like attention, and draw peoples eyes when you go out. You have cool style and are clean person. You like to drink and have an occasional smoke. You have your life together and get bored sometimes when there's no one around. Hit me up! If you are really light skinned redhead I will flip out, I love redhead girls!

Send me an email telling me about yourself and your interests and style. I am genuinely interested in you, and like to make eye contact when we talk. 

Let's go see some live music or hit a movie or art exhibit or grab some food. I especially like the beach at night. We can even grab some beers and hang out at my place which is nice and has amazing views of the city! I'll play you some guitar. If you sing thats awesome.

Looking forward to hearing from you!!

Hello and thank you for taking the time to read my ad. 

First let me introduce myself, my names John. I am a 40 year old male that is currently in a true female led relationship. I have been in this type of relationship now for over a year and I am learning new things everyday. My girlfriend feels I should come up with a list of things or ideas that can help me show my true devotion to her. I am open to chatting with any females who might have some insight, suggestions, ideas, etc for me to discuss over email.

Thank you

Hi! :)

I'm a nice low-key guy and I have training as a counselor in several modalities. Currently, I counsel people very part-time as a hobby, totally free, just because I like to help people. I've had very good results. People feel much better, situations get better.

I'm not trying to sell anything, or push any particular ideas or viewpoints. Just here to help. I'm kind, considerate, non-judgemental, a great listener, friendly and funny. I work with people over the phone.

Feel free to contact me if you want to. Maybe I can help.

The complete historical subjugation of women to men must be rated as one of the most fantastic myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.
Jane Fall. Feminism is a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave
their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.
Pat Robertson-right wing Christian evangelist. A woman reading Playboy feels like a Jew reading a
Nazi manual. Gloria Steinem. The more famous and powerful I get, the more power I have to hurt
men. Men use the night to erase us. Stella Adler. We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by
feminists who are anxious to force us to regard the sexes as completely equal in portion and worth.
Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

I'm drinking hot tea... I've just burnt my tongue, yet again because I'm too impatient to wait for it to cool a bit...my hair is very seldom perfectly coiffed as it is curly and it has a mind of its own, but no matter. I don't know all things, but I'd like to. I awant to speak about nothing, anything, all things. I tend to be awkward if I find you attractive. I'm that girl that laughs at your silly jokes, not because you're particularly funny, but because I like it when you smile. I think people should always say what they mean, instead of when they think you want most to hear. I prefer SmartWater over Fiji, but coconut water is my favorite if it's available. I sing along to Frank & Dean and wink whenever they've sang something clever and charming. 

Side note - I'm not looking to meet. Sometimes... I just write...

Hi all, older semi retired guy here, easy going. I'm looking for a 420 friend that can host in SFV or SCV. Preferably from Castaic, through Sylmar to Northridge or Van Nuys. I do have my card but only indulge occasionally and would like a female friend. Someone to smoke or get high on edibles with. Afternoon or early evenings are best for me. I can bring supplies. Not really looking for sex play. If it goes there it goes there. Mainly a good friend for intelligent (or silly) conversation and a buzz. You see I'm older and would prefer someone around my age or a little younger but any legal age that can host is fine. No photo necessary but tell me some about you in the first email and especially where you are located. If that isn't in the first email I'll know right away you're just spam.

Hi. Please read all of this ad before replying. I know this is an unusual ad. I'm a lesbian woman seeking friends. But I'm looking for others who have had LASIK or other similar types of eye surgeries. I have had both LASIK and PRK. My life went downhill since I had the surgeries many years ago. I find that I connect more with people who've had similar eye surgeries, so that's why I'm looking for this specific thing. You don't have to be someone who is unhappy with your LASIK results. I just find that I connect better with people who've had these eye procedures. Due to my eye issues, I don't drive. So I'd like to find someone who I can hang out with, go places with on the bus or Metrolink, like trying different restaurants, museums, amusement parks, gay bars. I live on my own and would also be nice to have a friend who could sometimes help when I have something heavy to lift at home. Although that doesn't happen too often.
A little about myself: I'm in my early 40s. I am more butch looking. I have short hair. I don't dye my hair or wear much make-up. I am half Mexican. I suffered some minor burns to the skin on my face a few years ago. But I don't look like I was burned, I just look like I""m a little older than my age. I mention this cause I'm insecure about it. I'm more of a shy person. I usually let the other person do most of the talking. I grew up attending religious private schools in the San Gabriel Valley. I love animals. I like to collect movies on VHS tape. I am very liberal in terms of my political views. I rarely drink and I don't smoke. It's OK if you drink or smoke, as long as you don't smoke around me.
What I'm looking for is a friend who is preferably between the ages of 37 and 47. Someone who is kind and non-judgmental. I don't like people who cuss a lot or people who are violent. You would have to be a guy who is OK with us just being friends, being I am gay. (To any perverts, please don't think that I will be into doing a threesome with you and another woman. I won't do that.) If you'd like to go with me to a gay bar that would be cool. That would be cool if you were also gay, but that's not a requirement. 
If you'd like to respond, please email me and I'll get back to you soon. Thanks!

PLEASE READ THE ADD AlL THE WAY THROUGH, BEFORE RESPONDING!!

I am a massage therapist who is in need of a good massage. I've been lifting heavier than usual and could use a good combo sports/deep tissue massage. I usually trade with my friends who are also therapist, but no one is available. Since this is strictly platonic, I don't care about your gender, if you're single, how often you workout or looks. All I care about is whether or not you are a Lmt or cmt and are knowledgeable about the human anatomy. You must be able to perform deep tissue and sports massage.
If you live in Woodland hills, that would be perfect! I'm looking for someone local.
This is STRICTLY PLATONIC! 
I have my own table and supplies. You can come to me or I to you. either way works for me. Once again, this is STRICTLY PLATONIC!! Race, sex, height and looks are of no importance to me.

I'm seeking a long-term email penpal with whom I can exchange at least one long email with once a day, sharing our innermost thoughts, feelings, ambitions, and desires. Sometimes we just need to talk and we have no one to talk to- well, let's be that person for each other. Everybody's lives are so unique and complicated and distinctly important to them- let's appreciate the lives of others, and entangle our lives together by the simple, therapeutic act of writing to each other. About me: I'm a college student studying in a science-related field who's suffered from social anxiety and depression on and off. Sometimes I find myself (like now) studying late at night, or early in the morning, and feeling really alone in this huge world. Each day is different, yet the same- I only feel truly happy when I notice life's simple and beautiful things, like a little hummingbird flying out of the lush green bushes or the deafening roar of thunder in the rare storm. Maybe our correspondence can be, in a sense, one of those simple and beautiful things.

Hey. I'm looking for a relationship with someone that's real. I'm tired of being single but I refuse to just settle for anybody. I'm 28, fun, cool, down to earth with a great sense of humor. Spiritual and open minded. I am honest, adventurous, free spirited, intelligent and loyal. I enjoy reading, studying, writing and LOVE music and learning new things.

I'm looking for someone similar to myself. Older or slightly younger. It doesn't matter. If you think that we may be compatible send a reply. It would be better to send a pic for a pic as well.
do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers

Hi how are all of you?
I hate going to the movies by myself. It sucks, and I really love the movies, so without anyone to talk to movies about, I find myself rather lonely and not enjoying them so much.
Okay, that was kind of depressing, so let me start over.
I am looking to just hang out as friends with a nice Asian girl and who would not mind to go see the movie Olympus Has Fallen with me. I know, it's a mindless man movie, but sometimes you just need to watch something that has zero importance and forget about reality for awhile. So if you would be interested in this, let me know and we can set it up for this week. Monday would be nice perhaps?
Oh, why Asian, you ask? No, I don't have yellow fever or a weird Asian fetish (gross to both those things!). I lived and worked in Asia for several years and most of my friends are Asian, so it's just a comfort thing for me at this point. Just am more in tune with Asian culture than others and I'd like to keep it that way. Make sense? I hope so. 

About me: Blond hair, blue eyes, I hope you won't think I'm ugly. I'm in my early 30's, college educated, run several businesses, and am an author and app maker. I do a LOT of different things in my life. When we get together, I don't care if you are married, dating, single, or whatever, because this honestly is just about friendship. I mean, sure, it would be nice to meet somebody, start off platonic, and be more later down the road, but that's so far removed from my thinking for a million reasons that you honestly have nothing to worry about with me. I'm just looking for great company.

So if you want an easygoing, polite and respectful white guy to go watch a silly movie with, message me and tell me about yourself. Maybe send a pic but it's not necessary because this isn't about how you look. I'm 5'7, so maybe if you are 6'2 that would matter, because then it would look like I'm your kid or something lol. But if you are Asian, you probably are either my size or more likely, shorter, so I guess that won't be a problem to be scene in public with each other in that regard. Not that I even care I guess, but you might?

Sorry, tangent. So yeah, message me and we'll go from there. If you are particularly awesome when we meet, the movie is my treat. And we should definitely get together before the movie to just break the ice and sit someplace and talk. Sound good? Hope to hear from somebody tonight or tomorrow!

I'm a very passionate artist (photographer). I shoot black and white portraits. I have over 7 years of experience, and have a portfolio of prints to show. I'm seeking to find someone who'd be comfortable posing nude. I'd like to shoot a series of nudes inspired by a few greats in photography, Richard avedon and Helmut Newton. These are two of my favorite photographers with a very unique and well known style, and produced a strong series of work during the late 80s. I'm open to body types, and am willing to photograph no face if you prefer only having your body showing. Please contact me if you're interested or have any questions. I own all my professional equipment. We can shoot in studio or in a indoor/outdoor location.

Hello! I'm looking for platonic friends who enjoy attending pool parties (i.e. socializing, catching some sun, a little dancing, etc. ). It's a bit cold at the moment, but it'll get warm soon (hopefully) and I've already got a few spots lined up in the general LA area.

Shoot me a note if this sounds interesting. I'll be compiling a list and once the weather warms up, we can coordinate to meet up. Feel free to ask me any questions.

I just thought of giving this a try. I'd be down for Skype chat...text, audio, or video is fine with me; I use Skype for work everyday.

Let's see...I like all the Tim Burton movies and wish I could watch Breaking Bad all over again for the first time. I'm keeping up with The Walking Dead and Better Call Saul.

My background is in math and physics. Btw, I attend lectures in Quantum Electrodynamics and Particle Physics; so, yea...there's that. Oh...so here's a question for you.

Hi CL!

After surfing this casual encounter section for the past few weeks now, I've decided to finally post!

To start off, I've noticed that there are a lot of ""bots"" and ""spammers"" on this website, so I'd like to let you know that I'm completely real. It's a Thursday, March 3rd, and I'm looking to meet up this weekend, preferably Saturday night.

About me -- I'm 21 years old, and currently a senior at one of the universities in Los Angeles. I was born and raised near San Gabriel, and grew up here in the city. I'm educated, smart, well-dressed, confident but not cocky, and funny. I love watching movies and TV shows, to playing video games, to reading books, to finding the best places to eat. 

While I'm looking for a FWB, I'd love to also find someone that I don't mind ""grabbing a beer with."" I'm 100% not looking for a relationship, but I would prefer that we get along intellectually and that we're able to have a conversation. I'm looking for someone who's not afraid of the ""friend"" in FWB, someone who's down to watch a movie or grab a cup of coffee on any given day.

Sexually, I'm pretty inexperienced. To be upfront, I've been with two people in my 21 years of life. I do prefer giving more than receiving, but that might be because I've never really experienced a great blowjob? Nonetheless, I love being between a girl's legs. Giving someone pleasure is definitely more fun than being on the receiving end.

Physically, I'm Asian, ~5'8, and athletic. From years of swimming, I've gained broad shoulders. I love to stay physically fit, and I do work out around 4 times per week. I don't smoke or do any drugs, drink recreationally, and have no weird piercings or tattoos. 

Ideally, you are older than 18 and fun to be around! I love people who are humorous and know how and when to crack a great joke. I'm attracted to women who are smart and confident, a la ""lady in the street but a freak in the bed."" I'm open to any race and any race. Please practice safe sex, and be disease free! 

Kink wise, I'm still pretty new to everything. I've mostly experienced ""vanilla"" sex, so I'm open to trying out new kinks. We can talk about this! :)

If you fit the above, I'd love to hear from you! Send me a message that describes who you are and what you're looking for. Want a quicker reply? Send me a photo!

Thanks for reading and I hope to hear from you soon :)

Verify: It's Jan 2016!

Thanks for clicking on my post! I hope I'm what you're looking for!

I'm currently looking for a 100% no-strings-attached relationship with an older Asian woman, preferably over the age of 30. I find older women attractive not because of the cub / cougar fantasy, but because of the experience that older women have. It turns me on to meet a woman who knows what they want, how they want it, and won't confuse or mistake sex with a relationship.

I'm currently 21 years old and a business student at USC. I'm Asian (born and raised in LA), roughly 5'7 - 5'8, and fit. Been going to the gym 5-6 times per week, so I'd consider myself in pretty good shape! I also don't smoke anything (but am 420 friendly). I'm passionate about life, and love to approach things one step at a time. I have interests in all sorts of things from superhero movies, sports, food, and more. I think my best trait is that I'm very easy to get along with, and I guarantee you that I'll be able to make you laugh with my humor :)

Once again, I'm seeking a 100% NSA, discreet relationship with an older woman. I'd love to be your boy toy, one that you can call and I'll come to respond to any of your needs right away (granted it doesn't conflict with classes, etc.) Sex-wise, I wouldn't say I'm the most experienced -- been only with 2 people -- so I'm hoping to learn different techniques and explore some fantasies with you.

My only requirement is that you're easy-going (and clean/DDF of course)! This will be a completely discreet relationship, so I don't care if you're attached or married, etc. I'd prefer you to be easy-going, as I'd love to have a FWB relationship with a person that I actually get along with away from sex. It'll be great to sometimes meet up just to talk over a cup of coffee!

If what I'm offering sounds of interest to you, please don't hesitate to reach out! To weed out the spam, please put your city on the email subject line. And then tell me more about yourself! What are you looking for, etc. Plus.. a picture of yourself is greatly appreciated! (It'll let me know you're real)

Hi!

It's Feb 2016.

I'm a 21 year old Asian male who's always been attracted to older women. I find the age gap insanely hot, and the years of experience a huge turn on. To be upfront, while I'm not super ""experienced"" (only 2 other partners), I have been with an older woman before when I was 18 and she was 30. Had a really fun time, and looking to recreate that experience again!

I'm ~5'8, 145 lbs, with a fit/athletic build. I used to swim heavily, and love working out every week. I'm currently a college student, do not have any tattoos / piercings, and am DDF free.

Please be clean and FUN! :)

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

You've got questions.

Serious questions.

SUPER serious questions.

""What happened to a sense of wonder?""

""How do I rectify the natural human urge to make the world a better place with the reality of ultimately meaningless natural human obsessions?""

""What do I do when I realize being a grown up kind of sucks?""

""Where does this ennui come from?""

""Why is ennui such a funny word? It sounds like what a toddler would call his penis, an in-wee""

""Oh shit. Please stop thinking about that. The private parts of toddlers is never something that should be thought about, unless you're a pediatric urologist ""

""Is pediatric urology a real field? Or are they just pediatricians or urologists?""

Yes, we all have questions. Just hopefully not about pediatric urology.

I know this is a long shot, but honest abe didn't succeed in his first shot either.

I met this girl via craigslist. she had replied to a posting I had posted in casual encounters about me performing oral sex on her. We exchanged pictures, and sort of hit it off. We didn't end up meeting, but we talked, texted, and made intentions of being friends...Turned out she was a very outdoorsy kind of girl...like literally hiking everyday... as couple days transpired, she always talked about us getting together, hanging out, going hiking, and doing things together. However, ""things"" kept coming up, and she kind of ended up just blowing me off and shooting down the plans we would make.... It got to the point where she just ghosted me completely. This happened a couple of weeks ago... but I just haven't been able to shake this from my psyche.

It's not the fact we didn't hook up, but she projected herself as this sweet person, to only act and behave counterpoint to what she was portraying...I think that bothered me the most.

This weird experience created a couple of desires and unfulfilled wants in my mind. Where I am hoping that maybe...just maybe there is somebody out there...

That already goes hiking, or wants to --- but doesn't have a buddy to go hiking with --- or that their hiking buddy no longer really goes hiking with them. If we hit it off, I would be open to a more deeper and intimate connection.... if it doesn't pan out, at least we tried.

I would also like this moment to disclose that I am physically handicapped as well. As circumstances would have it, i was born without an arm, and leg, but I don't let that impair my mobility and enthusiasm for being an active person. I write this tidbit, so if you do decide to reply, you know about this going in, and aren't surprised later and feel I might have deceived you or this isn't what you wanted.

about me: fairly well educated, masculine guy, hairy with facial hair that i keep groomed/trimmed. deep voice, i'm about 6'1 feet tall and about 180 pounds. I enjoy a fine craft beer from time to time. 4:20 friendly, but its not a compulsory must...i don't want it to be the focal point of this post. No drugs, no stds, clean bill of health. Currently I am single, dating, but haven't quite met someone I can synergyze well with.

If you are seriously interested, please reply with your picture, age, location. A number would speed up this process and weed out the people that aren't serious.

lets give it a shot.

Artist seeking a volunteer muse to inspire my creativity and pose for me. No experience necessary, just an interest in aesthetics and maybe a sense of adventure.

All types will be considered, so don't be shy, just looking for someone who has a lively personality that will inspire me to create something eye-catching.

For a few hours of your time, I'll offer you a relaxed and casual environment for a bit of a daring experience that you can keep in your memory because I'll give you copies of any of the drawings that you like.

Hoping to find someone who enjoys collaborating and inspires me and we can do a few on-going drawing sessions whenever it suits us, but even if you are just interested in pursuing a one time whimsical lark let me know that you would like to pose for me. Let the creativity begin!

Hello, nothing new here...just looking for a friend that is looking for one as well:) i will make this simple..

-im looking for someone to chat with and possibly hang out with. Its been a while since i had a steady and long term email buddy, and its about time to find someone now. Talk about everything and anything. More than how was our day and more into what we enjoy about each other. 

-about me: i have light skin, short black hair, tall, thin but muscular, smart, enjoys walks, going to theme parks, laying on the beach, watching action movies, and playing some games (xbox360). 

-im looking for any girl that is young or older. Asian, white or Hispanic is prefered but im open. Im looking for a long term friendship than just a 'hi and bye' thing. long term meaning either a few months or a few years...just see where it goes and how we get along:) You can be married, divorced, kids, no kids, single, deaf and want to have someone to talk with or whatever else there is...as long as your fun to talk with and enjoy a good conversation without taking anything too personal if our conversations become personal.

I dont take things too personal, nor do i get mad easy. I worked at different places where it was a direct people contact where people tell me off or tell me hows my day, so im pretty calm about everything and keep cool under pressure haha

i hope this gets to the right person. I will definitely give you my photo once we get acquainted:)

-Enjoy your night/day and i hope to talk to someone soon:)

myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.
Jane Fall. Feminism is a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave
their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.
Pat Robertson-right wing Christian evangelist. A woman reading Playboy feels like a Jew reading a
Nazi manual. Gloria Steinem. The more famous and powerful I get, the more power I have to hurt
men. Men use the night to erase us. Stella Adler. We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by
feminists who are anxious to force us to regard the sexes as completely equal in portion and worth.
Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

Hello, im looking for a online chatting buddy. Im 28 years old. Im looking for a friend to chat online and get to know each other. Im not sure about meeting in person because i had some bad encounters when it came to face to face meetings and hanging out...like someone holding a knife in front of me and waving it and asking 'whats wrong?' lol...

-So i will just make this ad simple. Im looking for a friend that would like to chat online about things we wouldnt normally talk to other people about, talk about our day, and other subjects. I do not care how old you are, but as long as you are understanding, do not taking everything personal, speak your mind, fun, friendly and just yourself. All that is basically what i am. 

-i dont feel i belong to a race, but i just belong to myself. I just do my own thing and say what i want to say. I like to go to theme parks, take walks in parks, visit museums, see friends (which i should have today), play games, and go to the beach and enjoy the ocean and the bright sun when i have time.

-Im looking for anyone that would like to chat for the long term.

Hello, im looking for a online chatting buddy. Im 28 years old. Im looking for a friend to chat online and get to know each other. Im not sure about meeting in person because i had some bad encounters when it came to face to face meetings and hanging out...like someone holding a knife in front of me and waving it and asking 'whats wrong?' lol...

-So i will just make this ad simple. Im looking for a friend that would like to chat online about things we wouldnt normally talk to other people about, talk about our day, and other subjects. I do not care how old you are, but as long as you are understanding, do not taking everything personal, speak your mind, fun, friendly and just yourself. All that is basically what i am. 

-i dont feel i belong to a race, but i just belong to myself. I just do my own thing and say what i want to say. I like to go to theme parks, take walks in parks, visit museums, see friends (which i should have today), play games, and go to the beach and enjoy the ocean and the bright sun when i have time.

-Im looking for anyone that would like to chat for the long term. I dont like those short term things..but someone that would like to build a true friendship or something more online and maybe if we meet in person. I dont care about your age. I am into nerdy girls and older Asian women:) but im also into someone that is mature but fun to be around.

-I will send my pic but when we get to know each other. Im 5ft 10 inches. short black hair, thin but muscular, eat a lot of food but never gains weight, light skin, and thinks about the future more than what im going to do the next day.

-I hope to talk to someone very soon. i dont care if your too young or older, just be yourself and not immature.

Hello, 
I'm a tall, muscular, dominant / aggressive bear type of cuddler. I have a four pack, and am a really nice person. I'm seeking someone that wants to share a very romantic moment with me. I'm the type of person that likes to touch, feel, and kiss slowly. I enjoy taking my time with partner, and actually opening up the opportunity to get intimate with her. I'm not the type of person that rushes into sex, I'm the type of person that loves taking his time. I'm looking for someone interested in cuddling for long periods of time near a fire-pit under the stars, or on a cold summer night in the sheets. Truly it doesn't have to be sex, I simply want to show someone absolute affection through cuddling, and touching. 
I'm the type of person that'll offer a soft kiss from your lips, to your ears, down your neck, and to your shoulder. My arms would be wrapped around my fragile partner and I'd pull her in so that she knows she's safe. (I have big arms). I've always wanted to take it a step further and bring out the candles, yet I've never had the opportunity to do so. 
If anyone is interested in cuddling, kissing, and being shown that absolute affection, please send me an email. I'm a young guy, not one of those creepy 50 year old men on CL. I'm also well aware that it's seldom to find people like me, because I enjoy taking my time. To me it's not just about the sex, It's more of an intimate role that I enjoy having. 
Feel free to email me. 
Your picture in exchange for mine. :) (I will send it after you send me yours) 
Ps I'm 23

Hi there. Ok, I have a pretty unique proposal for someone who is going!

I'm going to the event and am wondering if I could make a new friend (or friends) to go with, since I'm not going with anyone. I'm flying in from out of state and am also looking for a place to crash while I'm in town, so I figured that staying with someone who's already going might be the perfect solution.

So if you are going to EOL and can offer me a place to stay for those 2-3 nights, I would be so thankful. I'm also a life & business coach, so in exchange for helping me out I will gladly offer you at least a couple of sessions for free, which we could do on the phone beforehand, or whenever is convenient. I have helped people with anything you can imagine. I basically hold a space of possibilities, ask insightful questions, and help people feel more empowered in any area of life that they need assistance with. One of my areas of specialty is emotional processing, but I do a lot of things. And I can link you to my site and testimonials so that you can see I'm legit.

OR... if you're not going to the event but are within walking distance of the Alex Theater in Glendale, we could do the same thing - free coaching / crashing. 

This ad is real, and I'm female... if this sounds interesting and like something you'd want to do, please let me know!

Hey, I'm currently 29 years old. First time seeking attention on Craigslist. Seems weird. But my younger friends says it's normal. They suggested dating web sites. But I'm not quite sure I'm looking for a date. I'm a full time mother so there is so time for dating. So just end up looking like a flake. So figured maybe someone would like to be friends and get to know one another. 
I love music, I'm kinda of a movie geek. I love art. My dream is to get into special effects make-up and or professional cosplay make-up artist. 
I pay attention to details too much sometimes, some say. I think it's a good thing. A lot say I have a Big Feisty personality for such a lil momma. It can be a turn off. and it can be a turn on. Most of my friends I've had for years cause well, they known me, they're like ""FUCKIN MJ"" .. anyways many new acquaintances don't have patience or open mind to my humor or views... Speaking of views. I am a mom and I am an adult that is prescribed to medical marijuana for almost ten years before it was ""COOL"". But like I said, I am an adult know when and where. I mostly bake brownies. Plus I get my chocolate fix too. It's easier to kills two birds with one stone once a month. ;-)
So If you wanna talk to someone cool, shoot the shit, a fellow: mother, movie,music,dance,cosplay,art, or you just wanna regualur old school pin pale to BS with. HIT ME UP. :-)

myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.
Jane Fall. Feminism is a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave
their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.
Pat Robertson-right wing Christian evangelist. A woman reading Playboy feels like a Jew reading a
Nazi manual. Gloria Steinem. The more famous and powerful I get, the more power I have to hurt
men. Men use the night to erase us. Stella Adler. We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by
feminists who are anxious to force us to regard the sexes as completely equal in portion and worth.
Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

I'm here doing a couple of comedy shows as well as a couple of auditions in addition to actual work. I'm hoping to meet someone cool that's not crazy and is not trying to kill me lol I don't have a ton of friends in Los Angeles and I guess I just would rather have a girl to chill with and smoke a blunt and stuff not looking for anything relationship wise but honestly I am single and I'm not that desperate right now.

This is strictly for free. I'm a pretty good photographer but want to use my camera more often for experience. You will have to host or in a reasonably close outdoor area. I use natural light indoors or out. I do have a light setup and even green screen but am not going to haul my equipment all over for a first shoot setup unless I get to know you. I'll take candid shots or posed, fully clothed, boudoir or nude. Straight or kink (exceptions are animals, blood, scat or under age) I'm an older bi male, a bit kinky so am open to any kind of pictures you want or need. From straight face shots for portfolios to your own nudes or a bit kinky bi or hetro poses with a friend, wife or girlfriend.

You keep all pics except for any you allow me to add to my portfolio to show what I can do. I'm also very good with video if you have your own camera and need personal video. And I do have editing programs, both pictures and video.

I only have time afternoons or early evenings during the week and it must be at your place or reasonably close outdoor area.

IN YOUR FIRST EMAIL, tell me what type of photos you want, where you are located and if you have the time... ONLY afternoon or early evenings during he week. I don't mind spending a few hours shooting if needed.

Any hint of spam goes right into trash I don't want to waste my time or yours.

Looking for over 38 something. I just can't get into hanging out with guys. So I live near the beach. I have my own place. I have a extra room and looking for a roommate (I'm not asking you to move in , just telling you about myself, hey want to move in?). I'm also looking for a platonic friend. I like non Hollywood blockbuster films. I like old classic movies. I like to cook and go out to eat, the full range of culinary delights. I'm very active and I'm really into lounging. I'll drink anything but moderately. Into casual beach cruising bike rides, I have an extra bike in the garage. I have tons of free time. A night owl by nature. Single never married no ex wife or kids. Average height, easy on the eyes, I clean up well, slim (not skinny) and very fit. I garden and like hanging out and in, going out finding place where there are no crowds. It's fun to find places where there is no competition for space. I'm open to get into what you are into. I'm up for learning the many things that I don't know. So in short I'm a fun and fit and active and I also like to be lazy, I'm a great catch but I'm looking for a platonic friend. Let's make plans for the weekend, let's get chummy. I will send my pic first if you like.

I'm looking to practice hypnotising others and need a few guinea pigs that are genuinely willing to explore something unique and fun. Have you been hypnotized before, or admired as someone else went under? Maybe you've seen a stage show demonstration?

I have some hypnosis techniques that I'd like to refine. We'd start with an online hypnosis induction through a video I've created. So you'd start privately at home.

If you're interested, please meet the following criteria:

Age 18-28, gender or sexual preference is unimportant, windows computer with stereo headphones (speakers won't cut it), and an ability to focus well, and above all that you're genuinely interested in hypnosis and not a skeptic.

At some point, if we both agree, will progress to meeting 1:1 for in-person experiments, but initially experimenting online first.

Tell me your age (real age please), gender, whether you've been hypnotized or caught sleepwalking before, and have an open mind. Put ""Hypnotize me!"" in your subject line so I know you can follow English written instructions.

I'll run this ad for a while since I'm looking for several guinea pigs. Thanks in advance!

The complete historical subjugation of women to men must be rated as one of the most fantastic myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.
Jane Fall. Feminism is a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave
their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.
Pat Robertson-right wing Christian evangelist. A woman reading Playboy feels like a Jew reading a
Nazi manual. Gloria Steinem. The more famous and powerful I get, the more power I have to hurt
men. Men use the night to erase us. Stella Adler. We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by
feminists who are anxious to force us to regard the sexes as completely equal in portion and worth.
Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

I am a musician, American born and raised with strong roots, latin male. I play guitar professionally, all styles (mostly metal and indie rock). Music is my life so If you are into the music scene or you just like to go to clubs to see live music that's a big plus. This ad is for friendship and fun. I am Spanish with some Italian and was born and raised here in California!

I'm late 40's, have S&P long rocker hair, metal style and a crazy metal beard, but can switch looks and style for any occasion, easy on the eyes. Many of my friends are in their 20's, so if you're young we can still kick it, because I'm not some creep, I'm just older. I play guitar and produce music. I haven't subscribed to the whole ""act your age"" thing. Music scene and performing keep me young. I play metal and progressive rock so if you are into metal and or good classic rock that would be awesome! Concerts!

THIS IS ALL ABOUT FUN!! LET'S HAVE SOME! There's enough boring people around. 

Anyways, I like to kick it with white girls. I like to go to live music shows, and sometimes just want a nice white woman to accompany me. This is platonic, but who knows, maybe more if chemistry is right. FWB? Maybe just good friends, either way I respect boundaries, and I keep it real. I'm not some hard up lamer. That's why I posted here in the platonic section. But if we are attracted to each other there's nothing wrong with that. I'm open for romance also, haha, yeah right, like that's going to happen at my age! :(

I like fair skin and smart conversation. You are an open minded woman who isn't hung up on race, or the role that your peers expect you to fulfill. You like attention, and draw peoples eyes when you go out. You have cool style and are clean person. You like to drink and have an occasional smoke. You have your life together and get bored sometimes when there's no one around. Hit me up! If you are really light skinned redhead I will flip out, I love redhead girls!

Send me an email telling me about yourself and your interests and style. I am genuinely interested in you, and like to make eye contact when we talk. 

Let's go see some live music or hit a movie or art exhibit or grab some food. I especially like the beach at night. We can even grab some beers and hang out at my place which is nice and has amazing views of the city! I'll play you some guitar. If you sing thats awesome.

Looking forward to hearing from you!!

Hello CL goers =)
I'm in the market for a new friend and understand this is strictly platonic, so I'm not looking for anything beyond friendship really.

That being said, I'd like to meet someone new to just hang out with occasionally and have a fun day or a good conversation. Although I do not part take, I am indeed 420 friendly and I do like a good drink or two every now and then.

About me
I'm a really calm kind of guy. I despise problems and drama to the max. I like to laugh and keep my company laughing too. I'm into working out and staying semi healthy, every now and then I just have to have some sort of unhealthy asian food hahah

I'd like to be able to consult with you on subject's such as style/fashion, food, and possibly romance maybe return said consultation when and if requested. I wouldn't mind being a work out buddy at all or even just the guy you can bring to a party a trust you'll be safe, normal friend stuff ^.^

I just have to say this one more time because people on this site both male and female seem to not understand what ""Strictly platonic"" means; Just friends easily put. I'm only looking for a friend.

Well if I seem like Someone you wouldn't mind chilling with from time to time just drop a message in my online mail box and I'll get back to you post haste ^.^ I have pictures if you want to see me before we talk and I'll answer any questions you may have, I'm an open book.

Hope to hear from you soon.

If you are the type of person who wants to play a game of checkers and say we can't because we don't have a board. Get out of here. That attitude is pee-pee. You should respond. Lets grab some rocks and etch a checkerboard into the ground and play. That is how it is done. lol

I am not necessarily looking to date. I want friends and if things go from there that is chill as well.

So if you are down to meet up, chill, and draw some chalk. Hit me up.
If you want to know who I am ask. I'll send you a link to everything you would need to know.


In Addition: 
- Sending a picture gets you brownie points and I will send one back. 
- It helps if you live close by. It is not an issue tho esp if you travel. lol
- Helps a lot if you are single and without children.

Let's see. I'm looking for a woman who is looking for an escape. A woman who is looking to explore and discover her hidden inhibitions of sexuality. Is there a fantasy or guilty pleasure that crosses your mind?We all have them. Sometimes it just takes the right person to help release those hidden desires. There needs to be a trust to build upon. Knowing your partner will do anything and everything to make you feel safe and secure can give you the strength to enjoy something new and different.

About me. Well, I'm a 40 year old Latin guy, well spoken, friendly, funny, mature, and extremely passionate. I have olive toned skin, brown eyes, athletic muscular build (I'm not a hard body, but I'm not fat either), great smile with nice teeth, and I have shaved head with mustache and goatee. Upon first impressions you might find my appearance a bit intimidating, maybe even thug like, but I'm a teddy bear. I can be a thug if you want me too though. Lol. If you want tall, well I am not super tall, but I'm not a midget. I am very well proportioned with tons of energy. I can send you a pic or two if your interested. I'm also clean, STD free, and I don't do drugs. I don't judge though.

What do I like? A woman who is real. I'm attracted by a beautiful smile and kind heart. I don't discriminate. I think all women are beautiful in their own unique way. I do like wide hips though. I'll be honest, if you have thick in the rear then I'm all in. Lol

Well that's about it. Send me a message and let's see if there's an initial attraction or interest. Don't be afraid. Ask me a question and I'll answer it for you. Please don't respond if you're trying to sell something. 

To make sure you are a real person and decide to write back please write your favorite musical artist in the subject line.

Take care

I'm looking to just give massages for guys who are sore from working out or stressed. I do this free.
I used to do massage therapy. Our job was to relax people, but funny enough it was relaxing
for me to give them. I mostly do backs, necks, but open to legs/arms. Just the hand movements,
circular patterns, etc... it all somehow relaxes me like painting or drawing lines in the sand.

In evenings I have a space I can do this in. Please email me your photo (because YES i do want to know who I'll be working on and coming into my space) and say what hurts on you or what's sore.

This is free. I'm not charging anything. So it's not a deep tissue massage, it's more about relaxation
and minor aches. If you want, it would be kind to bring your favorite bottle of lotion to use on you and take it back with you. 

About me: Actually so normal of a guy, I think I'm boring. I workout 3x a week, read, love music, hanging out with friends, have a full-time job, college educated, etc... I just like to do this for my own relaxation. I'm from a mix middle eastern/white/latin family, and that's about it. Thank you.

myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.
Jane Fall. Feminism is a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave
their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.
Pat Robertson-right wing Christian evangelist. A woman reading Playboy feels like a Jew reading a
Nazi manual. Gloria Steinem. The more famous and powerful I get, the more power I have to hurt
men. Men use the night to erase us. Stella Adler. We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by
feminists who are anxious to force us to regard the sexes as completely equal in portion and worth.
Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

For the most part, my life is full of blessings: a rewarding career, a quiet home and several loyal friends; but lately, my social life has grown rather dull. I'm hoping to find a thoughtful, articulate gal that needs to shake up her world a bit as well. Although I don't have a litany of requirements in a friend, we'll probably get along better if you

1) would rather walk than drive.
2) are done with ""the scene.""
3) would rather meet face-to-face than text.
4) like guys that shave their head.
5) live in the Valley (or not far from it).

Please don't try to help me find God, convince me to vote for Donald Trump, or ask me to father your next child. On my end, I can promise delightful manners, a patient ear, an open mind and excellent breath.

What are you waiting for? Drop me a line and let's get this party started!

The early bird gets the warm...if not then the sunrise. Well I'm not here to cry about being single on Valentine's Day. No. I'm also not here to brag how cool is it to be single, but I am here to meet someone who is into photography and exploring the outdoors. 

Not looking for a couch potato but I am looking for someone who loves smash potatoes. Enough with the jokes. Not a comedian but I'm trying. Anyways, if your into phototography and want to hang out without someone who won't try to get your panties down, unless you want them down, then I'm might be just a good fit. Please have a sense of humor for crying out loud. 

Please have a professional camera. An iPhone is not a professional camera. Yes, you could take wonderful selfies but selfie sticks are not allow anywhere around me, I'm allergic. 

Please reply back and attach an image of yourself and one your proud taking. Let's make it happen today, we might even be lucky to grab some lunch on this busy day. A picture of yourself gets a picture of mine.

In my fourth year in LA I decided to move to Hollywood to try it out, but did not realize how infrequently I would see my friends in Santa Monica! I do fine socially after an introduction, but my social phobia is bad enough that I cannot just go meet people at bars or on the street. PhD in neurosciences seems to do that to people...makes us a little socially weird maybe? I wish I was better at it, but Craigslist has apartments, cars, exercise equipment, why not friends?

I would love to have a few friends close by to grab the occasional coffee or cocktail, roll our eyes at the tourists, or do goofy tourist events around for fun. I did the no-pants subway ride OMG that was hilarious. 

No idea who reads these, but I have had roommates from all walks of life and get along with most people well enough. Faster friends might be more curious about the world, geeks, maybe a little weird too, and value being kind to others. I am huge into running and lift at LA fitness too if those happen to be of interest, but they don't need to be. I also would love to start going to this Tuesday 9PM fire spinning thing near by...maybe you would do a class there?

I have enough of a media issue that I prefer not to post a picture of publicly. I'm not famous by any stretch, but I'll explain in person. Let's just say I have a very weird job!

Recently decided to try the whole meeting strangers thing and wanted to give it a shot, so if you're curious about hanging, we can chat and see if we have similar interests and we'll go from there. I believe companionship can just be casual. Sometimes when it's lonely you just want to enjoy someone's company you know? So yeah that's what I'm looking to explore. It doesn't have to be platonic, we'll just see what clicks of course- but looking for friends above anything. I'm an open-minded, 20/Asian/6'0/200/DDF. I'm REALLY into Pokemon, Sbb4, mmorpgs, cooking, baking, horror movies, and always trying new places to eat- but open to talk about anything. I'm an open book :) It'd be awesome if some new friends come out of this. Please be drugs/disease free and hygienic as well. Send your stats and a pic please :) ttyl.

Hey there! Seems the older you get the harder it is to make new friends. Unfortunately some of my closest friends have moved away and I miss having those random hangouts. Outdoor days or wine and Netflix lazy days. I'm very down to earth. I'm 28, single, no kids, educated. I like to do all types of things from staying in to going out and having fun. I enjoy hikes, working out, cooking, dining, traveling, the beach, mountains, happy hours. I'm not really into clubs. I mean I can go once in a blue moon or if I'm away on a girls trip or something but generally not too often. I do enjoy going to bars sometimes though. I'd love to find a genuine person to get to know and hopefully build a solid friendship. Major plus if you're not crazy busy all the time and actually have time to hang out. Please email me a bit about yourself and I'll respond as soon as I can. FYI I don't care what race you are or your sexual orientation just be an easy going down to earth person!

Honestly, I'm bored and bad at making friends in person. I don't care what race, gender, orientation, or age you are (Provided we have things in common and get along well). I'd possibly be interested in meeting up in person at some point.

I'm into video games, cartoons, scifi, and I like animals a bunch

Hi I've been struggling to create an online business for a few years. I dont know what niche to get into. I have ""Shiny Object Syndrome"", meaning I try something for a few weeks, then switch to something else, then switch to something else.
Fast forward a few years and I still haven't made anything.

Im an amateur web designer and I can make anything (or project manage to get it done), but I dont know what to make.
It seems like every niche I think of is already saturated and super competitive.

I'd love to talk to someone and get some advice.

ps - I live in Dallas TX but the people here are slow and not motivated, so I want to ask NY'ers who are successful and direct and smart.
I want to move out of here and to a serious city like NY someday.

I'm a college educated native to the Bay Area but enjoy traveling a lot and meeting new people. I work my 40+ hours , I'll go out for drinks, I work out a lil bit, donate money and time to charities, love the outdoors, indoors, music, movies, and mayhem. I can vibe in the streets or in suites.

I am looking for a road dog to have good times with and open to gay, bi, or straight buddies. Anything from drinking and gaming pals to helping each other hunt for action and getting into trouble. I live in the East Bay, but travel to La on business and to see family alot.... so it would be nice to have someone to hang out with and vibe with when I come to town. I've notoriously been a good wing man since I have no problem talking to ladies and usually go to regular bars (too bad I'm not really into women, but lately I've been curious hahaha). I could really use some guy pals though, just throwing this out there into the universe to see what comes back.If you like what you see hit me on snapchat- LuckyFella13.

If you are interested in chatting, hit me. I won't bite.

Hi,
I'm looking for a life long friend, and someone who can be like family to me. It's something that's important to me. We all need emotional support and others to be able to lean on. Someone to talk to when we are in need, and be there for them as well. I don't have a support system ( friends or family ) and it's something that I want. I'm a very nice, caring, respectful, shy, and loyal type of person. I don't lie and I expect the same from you. Please know that this is for platonic only and be serious about this. Please don't reply if you're not serious to be friends. 
Some of my interests: I LOVE my video games!!!! 😋🎮 I love drawing and Art. I like walking to places, exercising, listening to a talk show, listening to music, reading, learning new things, cooking and baking GREAT food, and watching TV shows. 

Some music of my interests are: Punk, Alternative, Rock, Grunge, Metal, some Rap, and others. Most of the music I like is from the 70s-2005, because most new music now adays is crap. 

Examples of video games are: 🤔 GTA4, GTA 5 (I love this game 😊❤️), and other GTA games, Red Dead games (I'm waiting for the third one to be out ), Gears of War, Dying light, Watch Dogs, Heavy Rain, Forza Horizon 2 I think, Dead Rising 2and 3, Little Big Planet 3, The Last Of Us, Uncharted Series (waiting on the 4th to be out), Rockband 4, older PS3 games, Nintedo games, Sega games like Sonic, Arcade games, Dead Island, FALLOUT 4 ( HARD BUT FUN!) Walking Dead games and other games by Tell Tale, and MANY MORE! I suck at Boarder Lands, Portal, and COD games, but I do try.
😬🎮
My systems are Xbox One (which I mainly game on), PS4 and PS3, Wii ( I'm waiting for the NX ), 3DS, PSVita, and Steam. 😋🎮

I believe that common interests help a foundation for friendships. So being near my age helps. Knowing our childhood interests help us to reminisce over the past. A few things that I loved as a child are Sonic The Hedgehog cartoons and of course video game, Mario cartoon and Video game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Batman, and SEVERAL other cartoons. I read RL Stien books and watched the Goosebumps show as a kid. I really loved it as a kid. I watched a lot of movies and shows as a child. I as well loved reading comics. Many aspects of me haven't changed. I still love my video games and watching some cartoons and Anime. Though as an adult, I have my responsibilities as well. 😖😋 

Thank you all for reading this. I appreciate it greatly! 😋💕

Ps. Please say something more than hi. 😬 Also, female friends are welcome as well! 🙂✨

Just so you know because I am an honest person and I expect you to be the same. I am in a committed relationship with my Boyfriend of 6 years, but i am allowed to have a girlfriend or girl-friends lol. If you want he can come Join us in going out or he will have no involvement at all when we hangout because I understand it makes people uncomfortable. I'm not the type of wants my friends being uncomfortable so yeah. I enjoy a lot of things in life. If you do something you believe to fun tell me and take me so I can be evolved and witness new and exciting things life has to offer! We can start with email until we get to know one another or we can text! It doesn't matter just don't be a guy! I do not want any guys!!! I'd rather not post my pictures on here because of my job. but i can in fact voice verify. So message me if you want a new friend in your life who is not a fake or flakes out on plans.

So I'm a 22 year old male and a cast member at Disney. I have recently decided that adventures are much more fun that parties and clubbing. All of my friends though are too weakened from working and going to school that unless it involves drinking with a big group of people they don't want to do it. I want someone who I can call or text spontaneously at night to just drive and find random places to explore be it a forest, concrete jungle, late night hike trails or anything just some sort of exploring and adventure. Sometimes I'd like to plan day trips to go out and do something or spend a weekend traveling to some camp ground in a random area and spend the weekend there. I'd like a female companion between the ages of 18-27 For this just because I feel more comfortable expressing my joy for adventure and feel I have the best in depth conversations with women. The point isn't to date or anything of that sort, it is to have a partner to adventure with and share wonderful moments and talk with. I currently reside in Fullerton but because I love driving and exploring I couldn't care less how far away you are I can always pick you up. Email if you are interest and put your favorite constellation and element in the subject line.

Im 6'1, 175 lbs, Average build, African American, good shape and I'd like to think decently attractive lol. Im a very fun and adventurous person love to go out and explore but it's no fun alone. Just want someone that i can have fun on the weekends with. Spending too much time alone. There's so much more i could say but that would take from the fun of getting to know me !

I've been thinking about my current female friends. I met them through work. So, I've decided to try to make new friends outside of my job. 

I'd like to make a new friend. Maybe, we can hang out together once in a while. I'm single but I'm not looking for a girlfriend or a wife. I'd like a female friend to go on outings (coffee shops, restaurants, movies, walks, etc.) with me. 

Again, I'm looking for a strictly platonic relationship, not a romantic one.

Please send me an email if you're interested. Please tell me about yourself. Name, city, favorite activities, etc. Thank you!

I have a small sailboat in Marina del Rey and I'm looking for a younger woman or women to sail with.

Not interested in: eating out in restaurants, celebrity gossip, watching sports, or drugs.

I am a successful television writer/producer that lives and works in Los Angeles. Really.

And while that may sound good, working in the entertainment business comes with its setbacks. Long hours. An unpredictable schedule. And not many opportunities to meet new people, namely because socializing with the people I work with is a no-no.

So, that means finding a companion to go out and do things with is often not easy.

Right now, I'm hoping to meet someone fun, intelligent and attractive who can be a great activity partner. If more develops, cool. If not, that's okay too.

Here are some of the things I like to do: Attend live theater, concerts, film, and sporting events, travel, check out new restaurants, visit museums, and do various other activities, some related to the industry.

So, if you work in the biz, or at least have an interest in things regarding entertainment, that would be great. I am pretty well-versed in popular culture (film, music, theater), and if you aren't, you should be open to learning more from a great teacher. Or turning me on to new cool stuff, too.

One last thing: Even though I work in the business, but I'm not obsessed with it. I'm easily able to turn off my cell phone during a movie, concert or a show, and you should be too.

Now some details about me: I'm a single, never married, Caucasian male, that's 6' tall, about 185 pounds, clean-shaven, dark brown hair, deep blue eyes, 40-ish. I'm fit, well-toned, intelligent, able to converse on a wide variety of subjects, down to earth, casual and quick-witted.

About you: I'm open to meeting a woman of any race. It's all good. However, I'm most likely to be drawn to someone in their 20s or early 30s, on petite side, dark hair, thin, fit, in-shape.

We'll get along if you are independent, up on current events, able to make conversation, fun, and adventurous enough to be outgoing and try new things, but not necessarily a raging extrovert. Cool, quiet and demure works too.

And you should have a great sense of humor. At least good enough to be able to tell when I'm cracking wise, and laugh at the appropriate times.

Emails with pictures go to the head of the line.

Are there any cute girls -- of any legal age -- who might like to kick back today, have a toke, hang out, meet someone new, and sure, MAYBE even get naked?

I'm a guy, basically easygoing, intelligent, even fun. I'm fairly flexible about what we do, but generally just hang and yes, maybe get naked, although that is not required, just an idea to enhance things. Maybe talk, or we can listen to music, or watch a video (I have several very good ones on hand), go for a walk in the park -- sure, any of that MAYBE naked (except the park, of course).

Tell me your ideas, I'm open to whatever. I would simply enjoy the company, regardless of what we might do, and it doesn't have to be naked. Hey, maybe we even will make a new friend. Or more.

I'm older, middle age, so you have to be OK with that -- whether you're older, younger, it all works for me. Either way, even if an age difference, I'm sure you would be comfortable with me, I'm cool enough. I'll bet I even could make you laugh. We should trade pics when I hear from you; again, I think you will be satisfied.

So there you go. Get in touch -- the day is getting older.

I feel a little silly posting this ad, but I'd love to make a new friend to go on adventures with and someone I can be myself around. I feel like I need to start a new phase in my life and surround myself with light and positivity. I'm 27 years old, just got out of a long term relationship, college educated, I have a steady job and I live in the Los Angeles area. Some of my interests include reading, photography, nature, music (everything from 90's alternative rock to French pop i.e Francoise Hardy), vintage, scouring thrift stores/flea markets, visiting coffee shops and baking/cooking. I love going to shows, art galleries/museums, bars, and checking out new restaurants. I'd love to meet someone who shares my similar interests. 

Send me an e-mail and please include age, location, and any other information you feel will help me get to know you a little more. 

Thanks ♡

So that may seem a suspect title but bear with me a moment.

I have long wanted to interact with someone in such a way where she
tells me what to do, and I obey. Non-sexual. Serious about that...I am
not looking for sex.

For instance, you tell me to wash the dishes and it is done. Perhaps you 
have other chores? In a perfect world we'd exchange a lot of emails
to ensure we're both comfortable, then move to the power exchange.

If this piques your interest at all feel free to respond and share your thoughts.
I am white, 40's, nice looking and actually pretty normal. I simply have this
fantasy I'd like to experience.

Thank you

To be honest, I used to know this very attractive woman. We were good friends and we loved each other. We weren't really a couple but we still kissed every now and then. I don't know if you've ever had a friendship like this but it was nice :) But it all happened so naturally. I was younger too. I'm not sure if I will ever have that type of relationship again especially if I ask for it on craigslist. 

When we did normal every day things it was extremely exciting. We weren't doing anything but simple every day things. But with so much love, every day things were extremely fun. I wouldn't have wanted to be anywhere else when I was with her. 

So.. I'm not really looking for a LTR but strictly platonic doesn't fit it either... I guess somewhere in between? But I'd rather have a loving platonic relation rather than worrying about a LTR

I miss tagging along on errands and just being there for someone when they need me. 

I miss being there to listen and there to entertain and be silly. 

I want a friend who isn't judgmental. 

I'm not a hardcore goal oriented person. I'm here today and gone tomorrow. I don't really worry about lifetime achievements. 

But, I do like being around nice women. :)

I think being educated is important to an extent. You don't have to know all of the secrets of the universe. You don't need a college degree or a fat salary. 
You don't need to be rich or a genius.

I'm going CRAZY in this room without any sleep! I don't know why you have to choose a sexual preference when in ""Strictly Platonic"" but seeing as I get along better with women I don't really mind. 
A little about me. 
i saw a baby seal the other day. It was cool. 
I LOVE THE DECEMBERISTS. 
AND THE SHINS. AND THE BEATLES. AND ELLIOTT SMITH. AND BRIGHT EYES.
AND THE CURE. and the list goes on, but enough about me, tell me about.... ME. Oh right this isn't a conversation, this is an introduction, duh dude, wake the fuck up. Your insomnia has proven to be stronger than your need for energy in the daytime, and now you've resorted to CRAIGSLIST to talk to (and like) the crazy stalkers of the night!
Ah sorry i'm just really hyper, no sleep gets me hyper? strange right? 
Well i'm a human being(and hopefully whoever responds is too, and that's probably like, the one girl on craigslist tonight, drinking too much coffee and listening to the Smiths) and i'm full of contradictions just like everyone else. 
I'm an extremely selfish person, OH YEAH, because it makes me happy to see other people happy, and I'd do just about anything to make someone happy. Jeez dude, you're such a douche. 
Let's ask the studio audience. Is he as self centered and douchey as he proclaims? Let's cut to commercials.
I'm making this as strange as possible because then only the reaaaaaally interesting people will respond.
Yeah, you lady, sitting there with your pinky up drinking your tea like ""THIS YOUNG MAN HAS LOST HIS MARBLES"", I'm talking about you. DON'T bother responding if you've:
-Never been the only person in the room to laugh at something, and then had everyone look at you like WTF is wrong with that chick/dude
-Never had your heart broken
-Never stayed up all night just to see the sunrise
-Don't have a favorite song(genre's are genre's, songs are songs)
- If your favorite color is turquoise or maroon.
-Just kidding, if you have a favorite color, you're cool in my book
-Don't find dogs even remotely interesting
-If you don't like yourself
-Well if you don't like yourself you can still respond, who knows I MIGHT LIKE YOU enough for the both of us :)

Seriously though, I'll turn no one away. If you're awake, lets talk.
I can be charming, goofy, stupid, BRILLIANT, and plenty of other things. 
I'm looking for a friend, or someone to talk to, with shared interests or COMPLETELY OPPOSITE interests.
I don't care, I love interacting with anyone.
AND NO, I'm NOT ON DRUGS. 
BUT my mood can be addictive. 
So come smile with me.
email me, let's shoot the shit, tell some jokes, talk shit about all our best friends and then giggle as they walk by.
BEAUTIFUL LADIES NEED NOT APPLY.
just kidding, you're more than welcome, but don't get jealous that I have better hair than you, and probably know more about female anatomy.
FUCK i cant stop messing around.

Hello there and thank you for taking the time to read my post.
As we enter the Spring Season, there no time better than now to get started working out.

I'm a 26 year old lesbian and my two partners are 22 and 32 year old bi women.
I work as an Entertainment Consultant/Talent Scout and often manage specialized fashion campaigns. 
Currently, my plan is to meet at my home 3 - 4 times a week, for a light calisthenic routine.

I am interested in chatting with a married woman about married life, kids, and the challenges that go with life. Please be married and between 30-55. This is not intended to be about anything sexual. It is about connecting with a married woman and having a long term friendship where we could confide in one another about life. You should be in the LA area.

Looking for someone to chat, txt, BS, hangout, have some fun and make new friends. As the word platonic states, simply friends. Recently made changes to my life and adjusting to a clean slate; meeting new people, going places, making conversation and just passing the time with some quality company. I appreciate a good sense of humor on all levels, and truly just to be able to laugh with someone.

I want to start life completely over.

I'm 40.
Divorced.
No kids.
No pets.
I own a house.
I own my car.
I'm highly educated.
I'm highly successful.

But since the divorce, I wish to pretty much:
- sell the house
- sell everything in the house
- sell the car
- find a new job
- find a new female partner to enjoy life with
- find a new church
- find new purpose

Basically, I wish to start life over at 40.

Am I odd?
Am I asking for too much?
Am I doomed?

Have you been thru this yourself?

Well not in any particular order actually, and yes I get I am posting on CL of all places.

I would like in free moments to have some fun and adventures in the real world, and welcome anyone with similar interests to maybe come along in your free moments too? I am single, would always be open to more if it develops, but have found most people seem to think everything is some sort of commitment instead of just enjoying the fun and adventurous moments. I choose to seek and enjoy any moment I can with positive people, as time is precious and hoping maybe can reach activity partners here.

Other times I have deadlines and commitments, and sometimes for hours into days, and I end up unwinding reading the CL posts for the great laugh out loud posts I seek. Sure sometimes I get educated, searching for the needle in the haystack or diamond in the rough.... but come on... we are mostly reading for the fabulous entertainment value at our fingertips right?

So I seek some sanity, some witty or intelligent banter, so I can make it through sometimes some very stressful moments. I have a brain, I have wit, and I know how to use it.

Am I going to send you to some site to sign up, or am I a guy...... No. It is just little ol' me on the other end of the screen. I am a white HWP 5' 8"" female, and from birth too! So no need to worry or ask.

So if anyone has some free moments to share, let me know. You are here reading anyway right? While many are not adventurous enough to post, are you adventurous enough to respond? Hmmmmm....

Hey,

Looking for someone who is available evenings after work to play tennis. I would say I'm about 3.5 right now but can hang with better players, looking for someone around my rating or better. Looking for someone who wants to practice and get better by doing drills, crosscourts, down the lines, volleys, overheads, short balls, slices, etc.etc. And playing maybe a set after that. I would say an hour and a half is good for me right now.

Tell me a little your game and your availability, thanks.

Hello there, yes, i am real and today is 3/5/16
PLZ, DO NOT judge that Im married, and do not think im some low-lifer. read then you can judge later.
I was browsing cl, and the amount of prostitution is unbelievable. This is why I decided to post on the platonic section, although I'm actually looking for more. 
I am a Arab-American, born and raised in Orange County-. I've been married for 5 yrs, no kids, and intimacy has gone and i think its due to my career. communication wise, there is none. We are pretty much roommates but we care for one another, and im not looking to leave her.
I am a former military and a former cop and I can smell BS from miles away. so, please, if you decide to reply, all I ask is be who you are and respectful. I am 35 yrs old. I stand about 5-9, 188, lb, in good shape, fit, light skinned, brown dark eyes, military clean cut. I'm self-employed, well-off and well-educated. not to sound cocky but darn confident and i wouldn't need CL.
I earned everything myself through my education and career.
I am a dominant male who is RESPECTFUL and yet down-to-earth. I pretty much am looking for the same except the dominate part. and when I say im dominate, please don't think im some jerk or pervert man who can not get laid. believe me, if I just wanted to get laid, I can. but im looking for more than just sex. 
If you are in the same boat and interested in just chatting and MAYBE meet up for dinner, then you should be somewhat FIT, DRUG-FREE, mature, and have something going on for yourself. 
If this is you, then please reply with (In the same Boat) in the subject so I know you read this. please no one-liner. 
No, i will not ask for a pic. i respect privacy and i take it very seriously.

Hey, I'm sorta new to LA (just moved a couple months ago) so haven't met that many people yet (that I wanna hang with at least) Looking for a cool person that would enjoy chilling, maybe playing some sega genesis or a board game while listening to some tunes ( I'm into lots of genres and we could both dj! I like a lot of psyche, punk, and alt rock but down to listen to anything thats got something interesting about it or heart in it. Also it would be great if you like smoking 420 as I do too.

If you, or anyone you know, that lives in/near the Los Angeles area, would be interested, please message me. An altruistic surrogate is my preference.

My greatest gift of all is my ability to love a person so very deeply. I am talking about a kind of love that exists on all levels, beyond earthly emotions. I've realized that there aren't many people that will ever be able to feel or understand it. But(!) I know that you are out there. You've got to be, because I can't be the only one. Maybe not here on CL, but somewhere here on Earth.

My heart feels like as if it were a never ending ferocity, glowing inside of me and always telling me the sometimes illogical truth whether I want it or not. And I just can't help that I find discussions about existential ideas a lot more interesting than talking about people or events.

I appreciate aesthetic beauty in all its forms. But what really turns me on are things like kindness, courage, and intelligence(and not competence): attributes which I can see as clear as anything else but not with the physical eye. I am often alone but I never feel lonely. I've studied philosophy, but I'm not wise because of that. I speak different languages but my silence is louder than my words. 

These are things I've realized about myself in my time on this planet. Perhaps you feel the same way, or have realizations of your own. I keep the hope alive that somewhere out there is someone willing to say ""hi"" and take a chance.

What's up! I'm looking for a serious workout partner. I do work at a gym and I had some trainers but due to a little financial situation I had to stop, but I still need to hit the gym or just basically exercise on a regular and I need to do it hard...but it's hard to stay motivated on the real, so I was hoping if I had some one to workout with it would make it easier. I do have T25, Insanity, Hip Hop abs etc and that's cool but I get bored easily and I want to lift some weights as well. Like I stated before I work for a gym. 24 hour fitness to be exact. I'm trying to lose 20 lbs or so since I weigh about 167 lbs and we can help support each other. I'm putting this into the strictly platonic section because my priority is to get a workout partner. I am not looking for sex or anything of that nature for real. It would help if you do have a membership at a 24 hour fitness. It would also help if you are somewhat in shape too. Not trying to over look anyone but I would need someone that knows what they are doing if anything. Thank you, hit me up and we can take it from there

Email me if you are interested and tell me about yourself.

For once I have a little time to myself! I'm usually pretty busy, but I have some downtime this weekend. I'm a 23 year old student (full time), and actively pursuing activities related to my field already. Occasionally, like tonight I get a little time to myself. I'm not really big on going out to the bar, or spending a lot of money at this point in life. So I figured I'd post this AD and see who replies. 

Maybe by some slight chance of luck ( an outgoing; attractive; cool) girl might come across this and reply. 

Let's meet up for a cup of coffee and chat/ watch a movie. 

No pressure to have sex ; if you want to you can come onto me, but if not you won't have to worry about me doing anything.. Unless you tell me to ;)

I am currently researching some information for a book, and much of the information I need is located in LA and West Hollywood. I am based near Chicago, so visiting the places in person is not an option right now.

I am hoping I can find someone who would be willing to drive by a house on Horn Ave. in West Hollywood and find out some information for me. The house I am researching is a Tudor style home located at the end of the street. There are two houses on the property, with the other being located behind the Tudor style home. 

The house itself is marked as being number 1229, however, the front curb is marked as 1227. I am unsure if the 1227 address is referring to the other house located behind the Tudor home, or if the Tudor style home was split into a duplex style home and has one address for one side and another address for the other.

I am hoping someone local wouldn't mind stopping by there and seeing if they can figure it out for me. There was a robbery at this property in the 1970s that is directly related to the book I am writing, and figuring out the exact address is the first step in finding more information.

This listing is in the platonic female friendships category. I'm looking to make some gal pals, female friends, but I am also open to the idea of also making some platonic make friends also.

I have several invisible illnesses...chronic health conditions which are not contagious and not obvious from looking at me. I look normal but I feel sick a lot. 

This has made it hard to make friends because I sleep a lot, and fatigued a lot, and sometimes have to cancel plans if I'm not well. 

I'm a caring compassionate low energy friend who is really great at giving useful advice. I am a talented part time telephone only based therapist. 

I'm hoping to make a friend who lives near me or could travel to my area to get together for low energy activities like going out to eat or just hanging out and chatting. 

My perfect scenario would be to get together once a week in the beginning with my new friend and mostly to use texting just to make plans. 

I have lived most of my life in social isolation and Facebook doesn't cut it- I need a real life in person friend or two. 

So if you are lonely also and open to hangoing out once in a while, in my area, shoot me an email.

Hi, I'm looking for a friend to talk to. I'm interested in music and film. My favorite book is On the Road by Kerouac, but I would like to educate myself more on litarture and the arts. I'm a musician and film student. I've recently become very intersted in classical music and am eager to learn more. I also enjoy the works of composers like George Gershwin and Burt Bacharach. In addition, silent movies are a new found passion. I'm also interested in social commentary and have admired the works of speakers like Allan Watts, Noam Chomsky and Krishnamurti. I enjoy spiritual talks as well. I'm trying to make time to learn French too! I've traveled to Europe before and would love to go back. I'm often told that I'm an old soul which makes sense I guess. I've never really been able to fit amongst my peers as I am often disinterested in their social activities or conversations. It would be nice to find a friend with similar interests.

Lets see how this goes. Here is a little about me. I'm 30 years old, Hispanic, single and ready to start mingling again. I stand 5'8, 200 pounds I am a total foodie I love to go to the gym and I love the outdoors. I'm a big time astronomy nerd I love to stargaze. I am definitely country at heart. I don't even know if people read these things anymore but I want to see if there's a girl out there that wants to hang out and maybe put some trees in the air. Not looking for one night stand more like a friend with benefits or maybe even a friend would be just at school. Here is another fun fact about me, I used to cook professionally as a chef in fine dining for 10 years. But now I'm an electrician. Your picture gets mine

Looking for Christian skating buddies (in line skating , not skateboards.)

I only welcome Christian Women who are sweet, easy - going and easy to get along with but ARE INTELLIGENT AND RELIABLE. Excellent communicators. 

LA is so filled with too many flakes and unintelligent life forces. If you are one of them, please refrain from writing me.... 

Just want to go to the beach and Rollerblade tomorrow, Sunday! :) 

Ages 28-45 welcome. Healthy personalities only. I have my own skates, but you can rent them for $10 an hr at the SM pier. 

I'm a Christian, and serious about it. 

Other things that matter!! Kindness. Character. Integrity. Sincerity. Honest to a fault!!! I prefer people who are honest to a fault than charming like a snake charmer!! Charm is deceitful!!

Mutually kind and caring friendships are what I'm interested in.

Fluent English speakers only. :) All races.

Women only. No men. Strictly platonic. Nonsmokers only. No drugs. No addicts. No drama.

If you are SERIOUSLY interested and fit the bill, you MUST send me detailed info about yourself. This is the internet. I need to make sure we are compatible. :) Be ready to talk on the phone immediately within the week!! Must talk before we meet. Thanks for your interest! :)

Friends first; lets get to know each other!!

I am looking to make new friends. Any good relationship starts out as friends first and in due time can evolve into a meaningful relationship. Someone who just wants to have a good time without pressure, be yourself and I will do the same. Personally I am an easy going, laid back can be funny as hell, very sarcastic and like to laugh rarely get stressed or become angry. I will make fun of you as well of myself. Life is short so I just like to enjoy the days as they go by. I will at times do random acts of kindness to others just to make myself feel better and to make our world a better place for all. As to what I like to do the laundry list can go on and on, but will try almost anything once. Some of the things I enjoy most are trying new restaurants (ethnic ones with a green B in the window) road trips speeding to our destination, the outdoors and cooking and yes I am a good cook. Quiet moments together just enjoying the company of one and other; lets not forget acting our shoe size not our age.

One thing that is very important to me is that you are an honest and real, a kind and caring person who speaks the truth. Someone who has feelings and is not afraid to express then, help each other out in both times of good and bad.I don't care what you do fore work or where you live or what you drive, just be a good hearted and a real person that hard to find this city we call home. Ideally I am looking for someone who is a least 35.

What I would like to get out of this post, is to make some new friends and maybe just maybe a best friend and a lover. Someone to grow old and grey and tooth-less with and have medacare buy us a pare of Hoverrounds.

Where do you live, a zip code will work. Just want to make shore were both in the same time zone?

What decade where you born in?

Should I be a monkey suite or jeans and tee shirt person?

Are you just as happy eating at an ethnic restaurant with a green B in the window as you might be at a fine dining restaurant?

I am looking to make new friends on here. Might sound strange but I'd always nice to meet new people with similar interests. 

-I am a 26 years old Latino, 6'1ft, green eyes and very short hair. 
-UCLA and USC alumni. 
-Traveler: Belize, Mexico, Guatemala, Spain, and Africa, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, and Texas. 
-I have an ENFP personality. 
-Currently working two part time jobs. 
-I am professional working in higher education institutions. 
-Born and raised in south central LA. 
-Come from a big family, but seriously tho. 
-I love to make others laugh and be silly and goofy. I am considered to be the class clown. -Life is too short to waste it on negative things. 
-Not too much into sports unless UCLA and/or USC plays. 
-Not as physically active as I should be, but I am working on it this year. #2016goals
-Do not have a Disneyland AP but visit multiple times throughout the year. 
-I plan to obtain my Ph.D. and do research focusing on remedial education at community colleges. 

Lastly, I am seeking a friendship with someone with similar interests. I am over guys just trying to hook up, that's just not my priority anymore. Let's start off as friends and take it from there. I am not a superficial type of guy nor someone that sets expectations of education, background, age, race, or professionalism. Just please be respectful as I am myself. I look forward to meeting someone I can relate to and go from there.

Holding each other close, snuggling, and enjoying each other's presence is a great way to relax into bliss and feel good. No sex or happy ending. Perhaps a full body, amateur massage followed by rest and some TLC would feel nice. Looking for average, h/w proportionate, clean cut Straight/Bi/Gay males yearning for nurturing touch, connection and kindness. All ages are welcome. Be who you are, be free of that social persona, feel good, and rest/relax in the safety of caring affection. A friendly cuddle reduces stress and anxiety, is healthy for body and soul, develops trust, is an instant way to come alive and certainly is great for feeling bonded to another. Having a good heart is what this is all about. Affection, Friendship, Caressing, Massage, Hugging, Care, Tactile, Respect, Trust, In-Spirit, and Feeling Safe -- Wow Terms! Let me know if there is any interest in this. I am Caucasian, h/w proportionate, understanding, and discreet looking for similar -- plus there is never a charge. We simultaneously have the opportunity to experience some inner freedom and wholeness in the present moment through touch.

I'm a college educated native to the Bay Area but enjoy traveling a lot and meeting new people. I work my 40+ hours , I'll go out for drinks, I work out a lil bit, donate money and time to charities, love the outdoors, indoors, music, movies, and mayhem. I can vibe in the streets or in suites.

I am looking for a road dog to have good times with and open to gay, bi, or straight buddies. Anything from drinking and gaming pals to helping each other hunt for action and getting into trouble. I live in the East Bay, but travel to La on business and to see family alot.... so it would be nice to have someone to hang out with and vibe with when I come to town. I've notoriously been a good wing man since I have no problem talking to ladies and usually go to regular bars (too bad I'm not really into women, but lately I've been curious hahaha). I could really use some guy pals though, just throwing this out there into the universe to see what comes back.If you like what you see hit me on snapchat- LuckyFella13.

Hey ladies, 
I am female, 25 years old.

I am an executive assistant and I am looking for a driver. 

I am looking for a female driver with a valid drivers license. 

I will pay 10$ an hour for rides. 

**** I make websites and with my new assistant position I can not find the time to make websites. I would love for the driver I hire to want to learn how to make websites. I want to give website development jobs to the driver I hire. There's a beautiful place to work where I work, while I'm doing work the driver would be building websites. If you don't have a computer that's okay, I have a computer you can use and I will teach and assist with any complications that come with web building. 

This may sound complicated, life is wild and I am very serious about this.

I paint, draw, sculpt, love life, design, I make music, learn new things everyday, I am on point. I'd love to find another girl who is on point and ready to learn & work.

My schedule is almost unpredictable so I'm looking for the right person who has a lot of time on their hands....

Only females reply, I do not want to spend any amount of time with guy, especially if I'm paying for the time lol... 


*** there's no sexual or weird things attached to this... I am a female, I am straight.

*** I do not do illegal things
this is for rides to work, errands, events, anything/ everything. 

*** I'd like to set up interviews asap so please reply if you think I'm looking for you. 

Thanks everyone !
Stay Blessed :)

Also, don't hate on 10 per hour, I wish I could pay more, that's why I'm coupling the job with website building so the person I hire can make money in more ways than one.

Very serious here though about finding a buyer...Looking for someone serious to buy my stuff...
If you want to cum over to my place (in NOHO) and check out the stuff in person, totally cool. Try them on, make sure they fit.
Basically, I'm a motivated seller. ;) My KIK is hotfacedbud

To kindle a spirit of sharing, I am looking for a female who can hang out. It is always interesting to meet someone new than meeting with the same ppl.

If you live close by from Hollywood area, hit me up, let's hang out at a coffee store in Larchmont area, my place, wherever relaxing, prefer a female between 21-39! Only thing I ask is that you take care of yourself. Please be fit. If you are pissed at what I just wrote, please move on. I like to associate with people who have something going on. 

Also, don't be a paranoid flakey mofo. Otherwise, you are welcome!

I am a business owner in mid 30's a guy; can't post or email my pics because I run a biz.

Email me your info, and I will contact you.

Please possibly-Allow Us: 2 FIND work as an apt. management team 2 live rent FREE!

Aloha Human Honey,

I seek to team up with you and LOCATE apartment management work together! We can be partners as living-work-room-dream-mates to enjoy the benefit of FREE RENT if we collect it and account for it. Please consider my proposal to be my apprentice and associate to establish an apartment management and/or supervision team. 
You are welcome 2 co-exist; with me here in Temecula, CA: until we locate work. 
This is a career opportunity requiring honest happy intelligence; providing flexibility to develop other sources of income and achieve personal goals. Many positions require a TEAM to administrate and supervise maintenance. I promise: I can work and live together joyously; because the joy of a good job and luxurious living space predicate dreams of Love. I am trilingual Love/Spanish/English with 10 years experience managing apartments in the Southern California area. Your abilities and beauty add to our resume especially if you know another language.
Ladies are more compatible to me; psychologically, philosophically, physically, psychically, and politically: therefore; I seek a Lady work partner, to share living space because working together daily; is easy with pleasant personalities and an honest desire for lucrative longevity. Being a team mate facilitates acquiring work: as a Human Resource person advised me; ""I would hire you: BUT; our insurance doesn't want a lonely guy with the keys to beautiful peoples' apartments"". I promise to cooperate and handle our lack or enjoyment of a sexual reality with dignity; according to our eternal compatibilities and your desires. 
There are three ways we can prosper; 1. We locate work as business apprentice-associate-partners and employees to receive a salary and an apartment to reside in, 2. Contract work as Absolute Supervision my company to earn a percentage of; the gross collected rents we collect, 3. We buy with a zero $ down payment deal; we submit generous purchase proposals benefitting seller to acquire and operate apartment buildings. 
Every month our rent will be free plus a salary which depends on amount of units we manage and our responsibilities: or we develop a cash flow from buildings we acquire. It is easy to enjoy being rewarded for: executive honesty to collect rents and manage fairly/equally so tenants can quietly enjoy their apartment homes. Some positions have expensive building rents; therefore, housing is not included. Thus, we earn a generous salary, live off-site at an income property we purchase and own together.
All conditions are negotiable; and we shall respect the promises we establish.
1. We can exist harmoniously and enjoy life where we dream, eat, work and exercise. 
2. I shall respect your privacy and will abide by all living conditions we agree to.
3. I exist as a EVO-lacto-vegetarian; yet, I appreciate all appetites.
4. I am 420 compatible; I party with moderation to celebrate life socially
I am a dignified professional: upgrading my career, I shall excel with an effervescent partner. Our mutual cooperation will earn us a new apartment home with responsibilities to orchestrate a functional housing complex that enhances the community. I have the willingness to work anywhere in Southern California. I am well researched 'cultural vulture'; I co-exist with all cultures of people joyfully and I enjoy the best from all ethnicities to promote and establish world peace with prosperity. I an avid advocate and member of the US GREEN tea PARTY because: we must help our global village avoid extinction! Our World SOUL-U-tion; is #LOVEvolution: first end hunger, then dissipate hate, vanquish violence, dismantle nuclear reactor/weapons, and cure cancers! Thank you: your time and consideration are appreciated.
My offer for a live in apprenticeship: is contingent on our compatibility; I appreciatively consider all offers for barter, work, lodging, counseling, and especially Love.
JESUS, GOD and scientific Logic command: LOVE your neighbor; and bake Love-cake. 
Mahalo Peace and Love all ways: Robert aka mr-funsun.	
p.s. In my LIFE: seduction begins in a Lady's heart: thus; if you are not attracted to me, I can forget romance and excel at profitability while we help preserve oxygen and water to establish human dignity for all. I promise to adhere to our agreement and exist in harmony: because; I respect and adore ladies, my final sexual fantasy is to create babies. I produce peoples' dreams; not seduce people, I exist to help people achieve contentment.

Interest is all that matters & makes all the difference). As a licensed and certified Esthetician I tend to be on the giving end more so than receiving lol.

Not trying to hook up, but give you the perfect hook up that benefits us both! Even potentially the start of an awesome friendship.

I know all married men say this but in this case it is true and I can prove it. My wife works long hours and I am so lonely. I have never cheated and don't plan to start. I just want a nice woman to talk to via phone, text, video chat. We can also hang out from time to time at a mall, or go shopping. I love going out to lunch and I would love someone to dine with. If you have some free time and would love a respectful, married man to pass the time with who will NOT try to sleep with you, please reach out to me with your photo. After all, you see me. It's only fair I see you.

I am an Asian undergrad who is working, working out, and working out the kinks in life. I'm learning to be more open to new people around me. I am more comfortable to meet over near a coffee place or shopping plaza to get to know anyone. 

Its a goal of mind to make at least one friend of each ethnicity. So far I am lacking any friends that are White/Black/Indian/Etc. Basically I only have Asian friends. Age wise, I hope you would be around at least 20 but at most 34. I feel that a decade more than my age would count enough to be my life mentor's age rather than a friend. Let me know of your ideas about what would be fun to do. 

I hope to learn more about what it means to carry friendships that are not only deep but wide. Please send a picture and we could talk from there.

Are there any cute girls (or women) -- of any legal age -- who might like to kick back this afternoon, have a toke, hang out, meet someone new, and sure, MAYBE even get naked, although that is not necessary? 

I'm a guy, basically easygoing, intelligent, even fun. I can even make you laugh -- whether with me or at me, who cares. I'm sure I could make you happy.

I'm fairly flexible about what we do, but generally just hang and yes, maybe get naked, although that is not required, just an idea to enhance things and get your attention. Maybe talk, or we can listen to music, or watch a video (I have several very good ones on hand), go for a walk in the park -- sure, any of that MAYBE naked (except the park, of course). Tell me your ideas, I'm open to whatever. I would simply enjoy the company, regardless of what we might do, and it doesn't have to be naked. Hey, maybe we even will make a new friend. Or more.

I'm older, middle age, so you have to be OK with that -- whether you're older, younger, it all works for me. Either way, even if an age difference, I'm sure you would be comfortable with me, I'm cool enough. We should trade pics when I hear from you; again, I think you will be satisfied.

So there you go. Get in touch -- the day is only getting older.

Hello,

My name is Brendan and I am a 24 year old gay male. I recently relocated from Seattle to LA. My roommate is having family visit for the month of March. I agreed that because he has a few family members coming to stay, that I would find a couch to surf for the month. This has proven more difficult than I expected. I have been staying with my friend who lives in DTLA however parking is extremely expensive and I cannot come and go as I please in the parking lot that is available. Currently, I am working in nightlife on the weekends and am looking for social work jobs. In the past I have worked with foster youth. 

I am looking for a couch to surf in LA. I am a friendly, outgoing person who enjoys doing yoga, having a beer, and meeting new people. I would not be apposed to helping out around the house in exchange for a place to crash for a few nights. 

Feel free to ask any questions you may have.

This is Danielle again.

I just moved in to a new place and already, my roommate is switching the rules on me. So I'm going to start looking for somewhere else to go. Idealy near Burbank, Glendale or Pasadena. Or Van Nuys, North Hollywood.

Last time I looked I had people contact me from Thousand Oaks. That's just TOO far. So please, if you don't have anything in the cities I've mentioned, don't waste your time asking, thank you.

I am clean, quiet and dependable. I am between work assignments, so I can pay rent, just don't have enough for a deposit on top of rent. I work in the entertainment industry as an executive assistant.

I can afford between $400-$500 a month max.

I am a 48-year-old, 6ft, 150lb., straight, white male, who grew up in a Jewish household, but without my father in the picture, and without being part of or subject to a lot what is involved in raising a Jewish child, i.e. without a Tanakh in the household.

Over the years, I have found the fact of not having a father around has been a tremendous void, and is one that I am now seeking to fill.

Specifically, what I am looking for are weekly sessions, for however long that day that they would take, which would feature three parts:

1. TANAKH (GENERALLY WEEKLY TORAH & HAFTORAH PORTIONS) - We would read both in advance (I would read in English, as I only made it through 4 years of Hebrew school), and we would discuss the meanings, and specifically, the values that can be derived from each.

2. PERSONAL, FATHERLY ADVICE - I would present to you one to three issues that I have been having in my life, and you would provide your best fatherly advice on those issues, drawing on your life experience, Jewish law, or whatever other source you can bring to bear. I grew up without getting a lot of critical input that my father wasn't around to provide, so I am trying to make up for that.

3. DISCIPLINE - POTCH IN TUCHUS - Proverbs 10:17 provides that ""He who follows discipline shows the way to life, but he who ignores reproof leads astray.""--JPS Hebrew English Tanakh, 1999. 

In this phase of our meetings, I would present an issue or behavior which I have committed, for which I feel that I should be disciplined by my father. (I grew up without my father, and those that raised me chose not to spank me when I needed it, but many years ago, as a teen, or earlier, I recognized it would have been the right way to go for me, and would have helped me a great deal.)

Accordingly, after identifying the matter, I would present you with a razor strop, for your use; you, in turn, would tell me how many swats you thought I deserved, and if it was over 25, we would split it into sets. I would take that from you, face down on a bed, stripped to a jockstrap, and the hugs and comforting that would follow afterword, as you show your parental love for me . 

I know this type of accountability would have made a difference then, as I believe my real father would have done it to me, had he lived and stuck around to raise me -- and will now, with you serving in loco parentis. He was a proud Korean War vet, and must have been a tough guy, who would have commanded my unconditional respect fron a strap if it came to that.

Accordingly, if you are a Jewish male, age 48 on up, and are a traditional, old-school Jewish father figure or father, or believe you can fill that role on an ongoing basis, either once a week or once every two weeks, in sessions, please write with your age, stats, general location, experience, and your ability to host the sessions.

I know this is quite a lot to ask of one person, but if you feel you fit this bill, write me as I've requested above.

I know that this might come across as crazy, but maybe not

Do you ever feel like talking to someone ,other than your friends, family or your
partner?

I have my circle of friends who I go out with from time to time and it's
nice, however I will like to meet someone or more than one person

to Meet up at least once a week for Happy hour or Coffee and vent
( call it some kind of therapy without the expensive hourly rate) LOL

We can talk about anything , We wont be there to judge. I think that we all
have a few skeletons in our closet. If you don't and you think that you are
perfect please do not contact me.

I like to go the this place in Los Feliz. If you are near that area, Hollywood or
LA ... We can meet up after work for an hour or two and we can talk about life, or any crazy
situation you might of encountered.


With this being CL and this posting already sounding crazy. Please I am not hear
for a hook up or a quicky , NO SEX at all


I would like you to be between 37 to 47, so we can have something in common to talk about
No Psychos and if you are please let me know , so it wont come as a surprise to me.

Be fun, if you are depressed that's cool , just don't expect a stranger to fix you, that has to come
from you.

I am Hispanic Attached , so Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays work for me.
So if you are available to meet up anytime after 6pm great we can have a few laughs , why not
if necessary shed some tears ( hopefully joyful tears)

** NO hate mail if you have no need to VENT or search for something that you, yourself have no Idea
what, but you keep searching through the CL adds in hopes of finding something . Please stop
yourself from sending me some silly email and telling me I am insane.. I might be more SANE than
you are!

If interested send me an Email on the Subject line put THERAPY, tell me who you are
and don't forget to add your name I hate to reply to emails with ( I don't know what to call
you)

myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.
Jane Fall. Feminism is a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave
their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.
Pat Robertson-right wing Christian evangelist. A woman reading Playboy feels like a Jew reading a
Nazi manual. Gloria Steinem. The more famous and powerful I get, the more power I have to hurt
men. Men use the night to erase us. Stella Adler. We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by

Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

Hi there,

So this may seem out of place in the listings, but hey, I thought it was worth a shot. 

I find myself craving something in my life and I believe that that something is more solid and long term friendships with kind hearted, spiritual, open minded and compassionate individuals.

So you may think..why go all the way across the pond to find that?

I guess in a way I feel I have exhausted many friendship avenues here and believe somewhere like LA will may have a more eclectic and open minded group of individuals that I am struggling to find in the UK. 

I consider myself very open minded, I don't care about your sexuality, race or gender identity. I just ask that you are a honest, open and generally a good person. 

About me: I love thrift shopping, deep conversations, inspirational and uplifting movies, aswell as a good comedy, I have recently become a bit of a you tube addict ( I love Just Latasha, Kat Blaque, Just Between Us, Buzzfeed aswell as some great ASMR channels), I like theater shows, vintage events, festivals, travelling, learning about new cultures, I study psychology so I am also very interested in the inner workings of peoples minds. 

So if this sounds like anything you are interested in then please get in touch.

Hayley

Hi. Are you bored throughout the day like me? Are you not getting the attention at home that you require? Are you in a relationship that seems to be going nowhere? Are you staying because you have kids and don't want to change your situation? Do you feel that because you're curvy or have extra padding that no one finds your attractive? Well then we have something in common.. I'm Joe, and I unfortunately can answer yes to all these questions. So I'm here posting for someone like minded to become great friends with. A little bit about me....I'm a Hispanic man in my early 40's. I am a very compassionate and kind man. I like football, the walking dead, star wars, metal music. I do have a child. I love Disney and going to theme parks. I don't smoke or do drugs. I drink socially. Enjoy going to the beach and camping and fishing . Love sushi and food trucks. I love to read... Mostly history or historical fiction. I'm non judgmental and very honest. I miss having a connection with someone. I enjoy innocent flirting. I find women with curves or bbw to be very attractive. I'm kind of shy at first as I've been in a ltr for 10 plus years so don't really have much experience approaching women.... Thus a texting friend would seem to be the best way to meet someone new. I'm not looking to change my situation at this time as my daughter is 7 years old. I'm in the east San Gabriel valley in case location matters.

Hi. I'm Joe. I'm 42. I'm a Hispanic man. I'm looking for a best friend. Strictly platonic! I have a girlfriend of 14 years. I have one daughter turning 8. I'm looking for a buddy. Someone to hang out with occasionally with and without the family. I'm a die hard Ucla Bruin and Green Bay Packers fan. I enjoy camping and fishing. As a family we are really into Disney and Disneyland, although at the moment we do not have annual passes. I enjoy reading...mostly history or historical fiction. I'm into action and comedy movies. I'm a big The Walking Dead fan. I love food trucks... especially Grill'EmAll. I listen to mostly Alternative and metal... AC/DC, Metallica, The Offspring, Linkin Park, Green Day, Ozzy, etc. I enjoy playing my Xbox, but do not have Xbox Live... enjoy zombie related games Dead Rising, Dead island, The walking dead, SIM games.... Topico 4, Sid Meyers Civilization, first person shooter.... The Brother in Arms series. I feel funny having to post here looking for a friend, but over the years all my buddies have drifted away... Sometime I just need that male bonding that seems to have slipped away. I'm a normal guy... non judgmental, very respectful. I'm a social drinker, but never to excess. I do not smoke or do drugs, however I do enjoy a nice cigar once in a while. I'm hoping to find that buddy that will remain close friends for years to come. I do have Facebook and Twitter, so I'd we do become friends hopefully communication through social media will occur. Again this is for platonic friends only... at no time will there be anything otherwise. If you're interested in making a lifelong new friend, please respond.

The complete historical subjugation of women to men must be rated as one of the most fantastic myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.
Jane Fall. Feminism is a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave
their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.
Pat Robertson-right wing Christian evangelist. A woman reading Playboy feels like a Jew reading a
Nazi manual. Gloria Steinem. The more famous and powerful I get, the more power I have to hurt
men. Men use the night to erase us. Stella Adler. We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by
feminists who are anxious to force us to regard the sexes as completely equal in portion and worth.
Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

Hi,

I'm 63 years old and I'm looking for a gentleman to spend time with. He must be active and basically healthy. I like being at home but I like running the streets too. I like movies, museums, shows, live music, long walks, the ocean, coffee, and good conversation...and more.

I'm healthy, active, and I'm medium build, 5'9"".

I lean to the left politically, mostly. I'm somewhat environmentally conscious, (I'm mostly vegetarian/vegan but not always), and I'm not into organized religion, but I have spiritual interests.

I'm friendly, basically positive, open, and honest. I work to be a better person every day.

Time's-a-wastin', as they say. Let's hang out and have coffee.

I'm currently in LA looking to rent a room on a temporary or permanent basis because I want to move back here because this is where my friends and family are. I'm moving from Las Vegas.

See you soon? 

Cathy

This is strictly for free. I'm a pretty good photographer but want to use my camera more often for experience. You will have to host or in a reasonably close outdoor area. I use natural light indoors or out. I do have a light setup and even green screen but am not going to haul my equipment all over for a first shoot setup unless I get to know you. I'll take candid shots or posed, fully clothed, boudoir or nude. Straight or kink (exceptions are animals, blood, scat or under age) I'm an older bi male, a bit kinky so am open to any kind of pictures you want or need. From straight face shots for portfolios to your own nudes or a bit kinky bi or hetro poses with a friend, wife or girlfriend.

You keep all pics except for any you allow me to add to my portfolio to show what I can do. I'm also very good with video if you have your own camera and need personal video. And I do have editing programs, both pictures and video.

I only have time afternoons or early evenings during the week and it must be at your place or reasonably close outdoor area.

IN YOUR FIRST EMAIL, tell me what type of photos you want, where you are located and if you have the time... ONLY afternoon or early evenings during he week. I don't mind spending a few hours shooting if needed.

Any hint of spam goes right into trash I don't want to waste my time or yours.

If you are the type of person who wants to play a game of checkers and say we can't because we don't have a board. Get out of here. That attitude is pee-pee. You should respond. Lets grab some rocks and etch a checkerboard into the ground and play. That is how it is done. lol

I am not necessarily looking to date. I want friends and if things go from there that is chill as well.

So if you are down to meet up, chill, and draw some chalk. Hit me up.
If you want to know who I am ask. I'll send you a link to everything you would need to know.


In Addition: 
- Sending a picture gets you brownie points and I will send one back. 
- It helps if you live close by. It is not an issue tho esp if you travel. lol
- Helps a lot if you are single and without children.
- I will not download any special communication apps or programs.

Name is Mike and I'm flying to L.A. on March 5th thru March 18th on business/leisure. So, looking to sync up with a female to hang out with, hit up an eatery, lounge, grab drinks, brunch, hookah maybe, pretty much anything casual and fun. 

Im an entrepreneur so, im in L.A. fairly frequently. Here this time to finalize a few business deals on the 7th & 8th between 9-3, so ill have the rest of my night and days free to relax and unwind. Would definitely like to hit up a few LA area staples like the scenic overlook, Manhattan Beach, etc.

Me: See the pic. 32 years old, single, no children, fit, easy going personality, really dig trying new and different things, prefer to be out and about but also netflix and chill, casual drinker, non-cig smoker, respectful guy.

You: good personality, respectful, willing to hang out and have a few drinks, understands Dutch dining.

Feel free to hit me up - put your favorite pair of shoes in the subject line, I know...corny, but i dont want spam lighting up my inbox. Take care.

I'm new to LA and I love everything outdoors including zoos, museums, and national parks. I find them fascinating!

I'm seeking a friend who also enjoys going to the zoo to come with me to the San Diego Zoo and / or Safari Park (they are two different locations). I have a dual membership that allows me to bring one person for free to both places. I'd like to go sometime this week / weekend. It's best if you can drive. 

I'm educated, employed professional, non-smoker, non-drug user, funny, cute, charismatic, outgoing, and pretty awesome! :-)

When you respond, please let me know a bit about you, your hobbies, and a pic. Oh, and any questions you have. I look forward to exploring the Zoo with you!

You've got questions.

Serious questions.

SUPER serious questions.

""What happened to a sense of wonder?""

""How do I rectify the natural human urge to make the world a better place with the reality of ultimately meaningless natural human obsessions?""

""What do I do when I realize being a grown up kind of sucks?""

""Where does this ennui come from?""

""Why is ennui such a funny word? It sounds like what a toddler would call his penis, an in-wee""

""Oh shit. Please stop thinking about that. The private parts of toddlers is never something that should be thought about, unless you're a pediatric urologist ""

""Is pediatric urology a real field? Or are they just pediatricians or urologists?""

Yes, we all have questions. Just hopefully not about pediatric urology.

Recently I realized I want a career in law enforcement... :) Its so discouraging when I have friends or current co-workers ask about what I want in the future, I tell them that I'm working on getting into shape to go to the police academy and if I'm not getting a dirty look, I get a one word responses, or how much they hate this or hate that. I think it's pretty sad to see so many young people not even encouraging others who want to better a community they've been apart of their whole life, to make their world or maybe even their future kid's community a more safe place. Instead I get backlash.



I feel like I should just keep it a secret, but at the same time I'm so proud of myself for getting this far, getting over the intimidation of all the what ifs and working towards something so great. 



I guest I'm just looking for like minded people or a few words of encouragement, its always nice to read some supporting words while I'm working hard towards something so big.

Hello, I'm Jorj. I'm 23, 5'10, 165lb. Brown hair/eyes. Bottom. 
In a nut shell, I'm currently living in VA where I can't find work (in this little town I live in) I'm living with my family, and have no way of making a life for myself. I'm young guy not living life and am just existing from day to day.
I want to branch out and find a better life, find love, and a sense of identity. 
I'm looking to see if there are any generous top guys out there who would be willing to fly me out to LA and help me build a new life. I'm also looking for some kind of relationship, so I'm not gonna use you and loose you, if you get the metaphor.
I'm someone with a lot to offer and of course would be willing to pay you back once I'm back on my feet again.
Sometimes life is lonely and we need help from our fellow man to make changes in our lives, right? 

I would be more than grateful to anyone asking my ad who is willing to help a stranger and make a difference in my life.

About you, just be chill. Hopefully you like to have endless conversations on random subjects and like to laugh and like friendly banter.

As the ad states, tennis is a big interest to me. Looking for others that enjoy playing and watching tennis. My game is not bad at the moment, probably a 3.5 but can hang with better players, I have skill and the fundamentals down, just need more consistency and practice. 

Looking for light hearted people and interaction.

I'm looking for a serious workout partner! I do work at a gym and I had some trainers but due to a little financial situation I had to stop, but I still need to hit the gym or just basically exercise on a regular...but it's hard to stay motivated on the real, so I was hoping if I had some one to workout with it would make it easier. I work 3rd shift so ideally someone that would be available in the afternoons or even early evenings or so would be great. If you have to do mornings that will be fine, I will just have to bring my workout clothes along with me. You don't have to be in the best shape of course but at least look as if though you've seen the inside of a gym or weights or something. I have a few workout plans and dvds but to have that push would be great as well. Anyway hit me up if you are interested and tell me your goals as well. If you have a group of friends that would like to join or that you work out with, that would be great since we can all motivate each other. 

Thank you

What's up! I'm looking for a serious workout partner. I do work at a gym and I had some trainers but due to a little financial situation I had to stop, but I still need to hit the gym or just basically exercise on a regular and I need to do it hard...but it's hard to stay motivated on the real, so I was hoping if I had some one to workout with it would make it easier. I do have T25, Insanity, Hip Hop abs etc and that's cool but I get bored easily and I want to lift some weights as well. Like I stated before I work for a gym. 24 hour fitness to be exact. I'm trying to lose 20 lbs or so and we can help support each other. I'm putting this into the strictly platonic section because my priority is to get a workout partner. I am not looking for sex or anything of that nature for real. It would help if you do have a membership at a 24 hour fitness and is somewhat fit or active/athletic. 

Email me if you are interested and tell me about yourself.

Thanks!

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind

sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

so the honest truth to begin this ad with is that I am married. I am NOT unhappily married nor is my marriage in any way difficult. I'm just looking for something more. I guess you can say I want something exciting and the idea of an affair has always excited me. In the end I think it's in our human nature to always want more than what we have. Or in other words sometimes we are just selfish. 

I would enjoy having an affair with a woman who maybe finds herself in the same situation as I do or someone who just find the idea of being with a married man exciting. As far as age is concerned I would prefer someone between the ages of 20 thru 32. anyway hope to hear from you.

Friends first; lets get to know each other!!

I am looking to make new friends. Any good relationship starts out as friends first and in due time can evolve into a meaningful relationship. Someone who just wants to have a good time without pressure, be yourself and I will do the same. Personally I am an easy going, laid back can be funny as hell, very sarcastic and like to laugh rarely get stressed or become angry. I will make fun of you as well of myself. Life is short so I just like to enjoy the days as they go by. I will at times do random acts of kindness to others just to make myself feel better and to make our world a better place for all. As to what I like to do the laundry list can go on and on, but will try almost anything once. Some of the things I enjoy most are trying new restaurants (ethnic ones with a green B in the window) road trips speeding to our destination, the outdoors and cooking and yes I am a good cook. Quiet moments together just enjoying the company of one and other; lets not forget acting our shoe size not our age.

One thing that is very important to me is that you are an honest and real, a kind and caring person who speaks the truth. Someone who has feelings and is not afraid to express then, help each other out in both times of good and bad.I don't care what you do fore work or where you live or what you drive, just be a good hearted and a real person that hard to find this city we call home. Ideally I am looking for someone who is a least 35.

What I would like to get out of this post, is to make some new friends and maybe just maybe a best friend and a lover. Someone to grow old and grey and tooth-less with and have medacare buy us a pare of Hoverrounds.

What decade where you born in?

I am looking to make new friends on here. Might sound strange but I'd always nice to meet new people with similar interests. 

-I am a 26 years old Latino, 6'1ft, green eyes and very short hair. 
-UCLA and USC alumni. 
-Traveler: Belize, Mexico, Guatemala, Spain, and Africa, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, and Texas. 
-I have an ENFP personality. 
-Currently working two part time jobs. 
-I am professional working in higher education institutions. 
-Born and raised in south central LA. 
-Come from a big family, but seriously tho. 
-I love to make others laugh and be silly and goofy. I am considered to be the class clown. -Life is too short to waste it on negative things. 
-Not too much into sports unless UCLA and/or USC plays. 
-Not as physically active as I should be, but I am working on it this year. #2016goals
-Do not have a Disneyland AP but visit multiple times throughout the year. 
-I plan to obtain my Ph.D. and do research focusing on remedial education at community colleges. 

Lastly, I am seeking a friendship with someone with similar interests. I am over guys just trying to hook up, that's just not my priority anymore. Let's start off as friends and take it from there. I am not a superficial type of guy nor someone that sets expectations of education, background, age, race, or professionalism. Just please be respectful as I am myself.

Be who you are, be free of that social persona, feel good, and rest/relax in the safety of caring affection. A friendly cuddle reduces stress and anxiety, is healthy for body and soul, develops trust, is an instant way to come alive and certainly is great for feeling bonded to another. Having a good heart is what this is all about. Affection, Friendship, Caressing, Massage, Hugging, Care, Tactile, Respect, Trust, In-Spirit, and Feeling Safe -- Wow Terms! Let me know if there is any interest in this. I am Caucasian, h/w proportionate, understanding, and discreet looking for similar -- plus there is never a charge. We simultaneously have the opportunity to experience some inner freedom and wholeness in the present moment through touch.

I'm a college educated native to the Bay Area but enjoy traveling a lot and meeting new people. I work my 40+ hours , I'll go out for drinks, I work out a lil bit, donate money and time to charities, love the outdoors, indoors, music, movies, and mayhem. I can vibe in the streets or in suites.

I am looking for a road dog to have good times with and open to gay, bi, or straight buddies. Anything from drinking and gaming pals to helping each other hunt for action and getting into trouble. I live in the East Bay, but travel to La on business and to see family alot.... so it would be nice to have someone to hang out with and vibe with when I come to town. I've notoriously been a good wing man since I have no problem talking to ladies and usually go to regular bars (too bad I'm not really into women, but lately I've been curious hahaha). I could really use some guy pals though, just throwing this out there into the universe to see what comes back.If you like what you see hit me on snapchat- LuckyFella13.

Hey ladies, 
I am female, 25 years old.

I am an executive assistant and I am looking for a driver. 

I am looking for a female driver with a valid drivers license. 

I will pay 10$ an hour for rides. 

**** I make websites and with my new assistant position I can not find the time to make websites. I would love for the driver I hire to want to learn how to make websites. I want to give website development jobs to the driver I hire. There's a beautiful place to work where I work, while I'm doing work the driver would be building websites. If you don't have a computer that's okay, I have a computer you can use and I will teach and assist with any complications that come with web building. 

This may sound complicated, life is wild and I am very serious about this.

I paint, draw, sculpt, love life, design, I make music, learn new things everyday, I am on point. I'd love to find another girl who is on point and ready to learn & work.

My schedule is almost unpredictable so I'm looking for the right person who has a lot of time on their hands....

Only females reply, I do not want to spend any amount of time with guy, especially if I'm paying for the time lol... 


*** there's no sexual or weird things attached to this... I am a female, I am straight.

*** I do not do illegal things
this is for rides to work, errands, events, anything/ everything. 

*** I'd like to set up interviews asap so please reply if you think I'm looking for you. 

Thanks everyone !
Stay Blessed :)

Also, don't hate on 10 per hour, I wish I could pay more, that's why I'm coupling the job with website building so the person I hire can make money in more ways than one.

Hey guys..... I got 10 pairs of used (but clean) underwear, in total (all pictured) that I'm looking to sell. 
Since it's probably not appropriate to sell at garage sale...lol....I figured I'd try to sell here. To clarify... I AM looking to sell all 10 to ONE guy. Maybe someone who enjoys used underwear... roleplay....
Mostly Calvin Klein trunks. Multiple colors. Small size which is usually for waist size 29 to 32.
Looking for ideally at least 10 bucks each so 100 total.
Male Escort here, if that matters to you. Yes, I'm hot and masculine, and a sexy fuck too. LOL I'm the one in the pic, and I'm 31, white, masculine, bearded, 5'10'' and hundred sixty pounds. Pic is of ME.
Very serious here though about finding a buyer...Looking for someone serious to buy my stuff...
If you want to cum over to my place (in NOHO) and check out the stuff in person, totally cool. Try them on, make sure they fit.
Basically, I'm a motivated seller. ;) My KIK is hotfacedbud

Please don't email me with just ""how much?"" Send me some details on you, when you are looking to come over and check them out and what you are offering.
I've done this before in the past and had a great experience... hoping to repeat

Please possibly-Allow Us: 2 FIND work as an apt. management team 2 live rent FREE!

Aloha Human Honey,

I seek to team up with you and LOCATE apartment management work together! We can be partners as living-work-room-dream-mates to enjoy the benefit of FREE RENT if we collect it and account for it. Please consider my proposal to be my apprentice and associate to establish an apartment management and/or supervision team. 
You are welcome 2 co-exist; with me here in Temecula, CA: until we locate work. 
This is a career opportunity requiring honest happy intelligence; providing flexibility to develop other sources of income and achieve personal goals. Many positions require a TEAM to administrate and supervise maintenance. I promise: I can work and live together joyously; because the joy of a good job and luxurious living space predicate dreams of Love. I am trilingual Love/Spanish/English with 10 years experience managing apartments in the Southern California area. Your abilities and beauty add to our resume especially if you know another language.
Ladies are more compatible to me; psychologically, philosophically, physically, psychically, and politically: therefore; I seek a Lady work partner, to share living space because working together daily; is easy with pleasant personalities and an honest desire for lucrative longevity. Being a team mate facilitates acquiring work: as a Human Resource person advised me; ""I would hire you: BUT; our insurance doesn't want a lonely guy with the keys to beautiful peoples' apartments"". I promise to cooperate and handle our lack or enjoyment of a sexual reality with dignity; according to our eternal compatibilities and your desires. 
There are three ways we can prosper; 1. We locate work as business apprentice-associate-partners and employees to receive a salary and an apartment to reside in, 2. Contract work as Absolute Supervision my company to earn a percentage of; the gross collected rents we collect, 3. We buy with a zero $ down payment deal; we submit generous purchase proposals benefitting seller to acquire and operate apartment buildings. 
Every month our rent will be free plus a salary which depends on amount of units we manage and our responsibilities: or we develop a cash flow from buildings we acquire. It is easy to enjoy being rewarded for: executive honesty to collect rents and manage fairly/equally so tenants can quietly enjoy their apartment homes. Some positions have expensive building rents; therefore, housing is not included. Thus, we earn a generous salary, live off-site at an income property we purchase and own together.
All conditions are negotiable; and we shall respect the promises we establish.
1. We can exist harmoniously and enjoy life where we dream, eat, work and exercise. 
2. I shall respect your privacy and will abide by all living conditions we agree to.
3. I exist as a EVO-lacto-vegetarian; yet, I appreciate all appetites.
4. I am 420 compatible; I party with moderation to celebrate life socially
I am a dignified professional: upgrading my career, I shall excel with an effervescent partner. Our mutual cooperation will earn us a new apartment home with responsibilities to orchestrate a functional housing complex that enhances the community. I have the willingness to work anywhere in Southern California. I am well researched 'cultural vulture'; I co-exist with all cultures of people joyfully and I enjoy the best from all ethnicities to promote and establish world peace with prosperity. I an avid advocate and member of the US GREEN tea PARTY because: we must help our global village avoid extinction! Our World SOUL-U-tion; is #LOVEvolution: first end hunger, then dissipate hate, vanquish violence, dismantle nuclear reactor/weapons, and cure cancers! Thank you: your time and consideration are appreciated.
My offer for a live in apprenticeship: is contingent on our compatibility; I appreciatively consider all offers for barter, work, lodging, counseling, and especially Love.
JESUS, GOD and scientific Logic command: LOVE your neighbor; and bake Love-cake. 
Mahalo Peace and Love all ways: Robert aka mr-funsun.	
p.s. In my LIFE: seduction begins in a Lady's heart: thus; if you are not attracted to me, I can forget romance and excel at profitability while we help preserve oxygen and water to establish human dignity for all. I promise to adhere to our agreement and exist in harmony: because; I respect and adore ladies, my final sexual fantasy is to create babies. I produce peoples' dreams; not seduce people, I exist to help people achieve contentment.

Well, Im pretty much bored of my social scene and would like a change up. I'm a established guy, that has a great job, and is about to graduate with my degree. I also own a self-employed business, that I am actively involved in. I take care of myself, and participate in physical activities and eat healthy, but I am not a gym nut. I am looking for a cute girl that I can hang out with and just have a good conversation about anything other than a night life or Vegas. So if you are interested, hit me up and lets see where it goes.

Long story short, I'm looking for someone that would be interested in trading beauty services regularly. What i want is simple- Head to Toe MASSAGES. No license required. Interest is all that matters & makes all the difference). As a licensed and certified Esthetician I tend to be on the giving end more so than receiving lol. Overdue doesnt even describe the half of it. Sometimes women forget what it feels like to pampered and catered to... that's so me! Even better if its you too. I'm not looking for anything else. Not trying to hook up, but give you the perfect hook up that benefits us both! Even potentially the start of an awesome friendship. Spoil yourself with steam facials, stunning eyelash extensions, body scrubs, waxing & my signature head to toe massages. Don't wait, interested, we can start asap!

No flakes, I'm serious and legit. Great opportunity for someone on the same level!

Thank you and have a beautiful day!

I am an Asian undergrad who is working, working out, and working out the kinks in life. I'm learning to be more open to new people around me. I am more comfortable to meet over near a coffee place or shopping plaza to get to know anyone. 

Its a goal of mind to make at least one friend of each ethnicity. So far I am lacking any friends that are White/Black/Indian/Etc. Basically I only have Asian friends. Age wise, I hope you would be around at least 20 but at most 34. I feel that a decade more than my age would count enough to be my life mentor's age rather than a friend. Let me know of your ideas about what would be fun to do. 

I hope to learn more about what it means to carry friendships that are not only deep but wide. Please send a picture and we could talk from there.

Are there any cute girls (or women) -- of any legal age -- who might like to kick back this afternoon, have a toke, hang out, meet someone new, and sure, MAYBE even get naked, although that is not necessary? 

I'm a guy, basically easygoing, intelligent, even fun. I can even make you laugh -- whether with me or at me, who cares. I'm sure I could make you happy.

I'm fairly flexible about what we do, but generally just hang and yes, maybe get naked, although that is not required, just an idea to enhance things and get your attention. Maybe talk, or we can listen to music, or watch a video (I have several very good ones on hand), go for a walk in the park -- sure, any of that MAYBE naked (except the park, of course). Tell me your ideas, I'm open to whatever. I would simply enjoy the company, regardless of what we might do, and it doesn't have to be naked. Hey, maybe we even will make a new friend. Or more.

I'm older, middle age, so you have to be OK with that -- whether you're older, younger, it all works for me. Either way, even if an age difference, I'm sure you would be comfortable with me, I'm cool enough. We should trade pics when I hear from you; again, I think you will be satisfied.

So there you go. Get in touch -- the day is only getting older.

Hello,

My name is Brendan and I am a 24 year old gay male. I recently relocated from Seattle to LA. My roommate is having family visit for the month of March. I agreed that because he has a few family members coming to stay, that I would find a couch to surf for the month. This has proven more difficult than I expected. I have been staying with my friend who lives in DTLA however parking is extremely expensive and I cannot come and go as I please in the parking lot that is available. Currently, I am working in nightlife on the weekends and am looking for social work jobs. In the past I have worked with foster youth. 

I am looking for a couch to surf in LA. I am a friendly, outgoing person who enjoys doing yoga, having a beer, and meeting new people. I would not be apposed to helping out around the house in exchange for a place to crash for a few nights. 

Feel free to ask any questions you may have.

This is Danielle again.

I just moved in to a new place and already, my roommate is switching the rules on me. So I'm going to start looking for somewhere else to go. Idealy near Burbank, Glendale or Pasadena. Or Van Nuys, North Hollywood.

Last time I looked I had people contact me from Thousand Oaks. That's just TOO far. So please, if you don't have anything in the cities I've mentioned, don't waste your time asking, thank you.

I am clean, quiet and dependable. I am between work assignments, so I can pay rent, just don't have enough for a deposit on top of rent. I work in the entertainment industry as an executive assistant.

I can afford between $400-$500 a month max.

If you are looking for help with rent and have a spare room, please drop me a line. Thanks so much, I'm 5' 6"", brown hair, pleasant smile. I am also gluten free and a vegetarian. Thanks for reading.

I am a 48-year-old, 6ft, 150lb., straight, white male, who grew up in a Jewish household, but without my father in the picture, and without being part of or subject to a lot what is involved in raising a Jewish child, i.e. without a Tanakh in the household.

Over the years, I have found the fact of not having a father around has been a tremendous void, and is one that I am now seeking to fill.

Specifically, what I am looking for are weekly sessions, for however long that day that they would take, which would feature three parts:

1. TANAKH (GENERALLY WEEKLY TORAH & HAFTORAH PORTIONS) - We would read both in advance (I would read in English, as I only made it through 4 years of Hebrew school), and we would discuss the meanings, and specifically, the values that can be derived from each.

2. PERSONAL, FATHERLY ADVICE - I would present to you one to three issues that I have been having in my life, and you would provide your best fatherly advice on those issues, drawing on your life experience, Jewish law, or whatever other source you can bring to bear. I grew up without getting a lot of critical input that my father wasn't around to provide, so I am trying to make up for that.

3. DISCIPLINE - POTCH IN TUCHUS - Proverbs 10:17 provides that ""He who follows discipline shows the way to life, but he who ignores reproof leads astray.""--JPS Hebrew English Tanakh, 1999. 

In this phase of our meetings, I would present an issue or behavior which I have committed, for which I feel that I should be disciplined by my father. (I grew up without my father, and those that raised me chose not to spank me when I needed it, but many years ago, as a teen, or earlier, I recognized it would have been the right way to go for me, and would have helped me a great deal.)

Accordingly, after identifying the matter, I would present you with a razor strop, for your use; you, in turn, would tell me how many swats you thought I deserved, and if it was over 25, we would split it into sets. I would take that from you, face down on a bed, stripped to a jockstrap, and the hugs and comforting that would follow afterword, as you show your parental love for me . 

I know this type of accountability would have made a difference then, as I believe my real father would have done it to me, had he lived and stuck around to raise me -- and will now, with you serving in loco parentis. He was a proud Korean War vet, and must have been a tough guy, who would have commanded my unconditional respect fron a strap if it came to that.

Accordingly, if you are a Jewish male, age 48 on up, and are a traditional, old-school Jewish father figure or father, or believe you can fill that role on an ongoing basis, either once a week or once every two weeks, in sessions, please write with your age, stats, general location, experience, and your ability to host the sessions.

I know this is quite a lot to ask of one person, but if you feel you fit this bill, write me as I've requested above.

I know that this might come across as crazy, but maybe not

Do you ever feel like talking to someone ,other than your friends, family or your
partner?

I have my circle of friends who I go out with from time to time and it's
nice, however I will like to meet someone or more than one person

to Meet up at least once a week for Happy hour or Coffee and vent
( call it some kind of therapy without the expensive hourly rate) LOL

We can talk about anything , We wont be there to judge. I think that we all
have a few skeletons in our closet. If you don't and you think that you are
perfect please do not contact me.

I like to go the this place in Los Feliz. If you are near that area, Hollywood or
LA ... We can meet up after work for an hour or two and we can talk about life, or any crazy
situation you might of encountered.


With this being CL and this posting already sounding crazy. Please I am not hear
for a hook up or a quicky , NO SEX at all


I would like you to be between 37 to 47, so we can have something in common to talk about
No Psychos and if you are please let me know , so it wont come as a surprise to me.

Be fun, if you are depressed that's cool , just don't expect a stranger to fix you, that has to come
from you.

I am Hispanic Attached , so Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays work for me.
So if you are available to meet up anytime after 6pm great we can have a few laughs , why not
if necessary shed some tears ( hopefully joyful tears)

** NO hate mail if you have no need to VENT or search for something that you, yourself have no Idea
what, but you keep searching through the CL adds in hopes of finding something . Please stop
yourself from sending me some silly email and telling me I am insane.. I might be more SANE than
you are!

If interested send me an Email on the Subject line put THERAPY, tell me who you are
and don't forget to add your name I hate to reply to emails with ( I don't know what to call
you)

myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.
Jane Fall. Feminism is a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave
their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.
Pat Robertson-right wing Christian evangelist. A woman reading Playboy feels like a Jew reading a
Nazi manual. Gloria Steinem. The more famous and powerful I get, the more power I have to hurt
men. Men use the night to erase us. Stella Adler. We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by

Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

Hi there,

So this may seem out of place in the listings, but hey, I thought it was worth a shot. 

I find myself craving something in my life and I believe that that something is more solid and long term friendships with kind hearted, spiritual, open minded and compassionate individuals.

So you may think..why go all the way across the pond to find that?

I guess in a way I feel I have exhausted many friendship avenues here and believe somewhere like LA will may have a more eclectic and open minded group of individuals that I am struggling to find in the UK. 

I consider myself very open minded, I don't care about your sexuality, race or gender identity. I just ask that you are a honest, open and generally a good person. 

About me: I love thrift shopping, deep conversations, inspirational and uplifting movies, aswell as a good comedy, I have recently become a bit of a you tube addict ( I love Just Latasha, Kat Blaque, Just Between Us, Buzzfeed aswell as some great ASMR channels), I like theater shows, vintage events, festivals, travelling, learning about new cultures, I study psychology so I am also very interested in the inner workings of peoples minds. 

So if this sounds like anything you are interested in then please get in touch.

Hayley

Hi. Are you bored throughout the day like me? Are you not getting the attention at home that you require? Are you in a relationship that seems to be going nowhere? Are you staying because you have kids and don't want to change your situation? Do you feel that because you're curvy or have extra padding that no one finds your attractive? Well then we have something in common.. I'm Joe, and I unfortunately can answer yes to all these questions. So I'm here posting for someone like minded to become great friends with. A little bit about me....I'm a Hispanic man in my early 40's. I am a very compassionate and kind man. I like football, the walking dead, star wars, metal music. I do have a child. I love Disney and going to theme parks. I don't smoke or do drugs. I drink socially. Enjoy going to the beach and camping and fishing . Love sushi and food trucks. I love to read... Mostly history or historical fiction. I'm non judgmental and very honest. I miss having a connection with someone. I enjoy innocent flirting. I find women with curves or bbw to be very attractive. I'm kind of shy at first as I've been in a ltr for 10 plus years so don't really have much experience approaching women.... Thus a texting friend would seem to be the best way to meet someone new. I'm not looking to change my situation at this time as my daughter is 7 years old. I'm in the east San Gabriel valley in case location matters.

Hi. I'm Joe. I'm 42. I'm a Hispanic man. I'm looking for a best friend. Strictly platonic! I have a girlfriend of 14 years. I have one daughter turning 8. I'm looking for a buddy. Someone to hang out with occasionally with and without the family. I'm a die hard Ucla Bruin and Green Bay Packers fan. I enjoy camping and fishing. As a family we are really into Disney and Disneyland, although at the moment we do not have annual passes. I enjoy reading...mostly history or historical fiction. I'm into action and comedy movies. I'm a big The Walking Dead fan. I love food trucks... especially Grill'EmAll. I listen to mostly Alternative and metal... AC/DC, Metallica, The Offspring, Linkin Park, Green Day, Ozzy, etc. I enjoy playing my Xbox, but do not have Xbox Live... enjoy zombie related games Dead Rising, Dead island, The walking dead, SIM games.... Topico 4, Sid Meyers Civilization, first person shooter.... The Brother in Arms series. I feel funny having to post here looking for a friend, but over the years all my buddies have drifted away... Sometime I just need that male bonding that seems to have slipped away. I'm a normal guy... non judgmental, very respectful. I'm a social drinker, but never to excess. I do not smoke or do drugs, however I do enjoy a nice cigar once in a while. I'm hoping to find that buddy that will remain close friends for years to come. I do have Facebook and Twitter, so I'd we do become friends hopefully communication through social media will occur. Again this is for platonic friends only... at no time will there be anything otherwise. If you're interested in making a lifelong new friend, please respond.

The complete historical subjugation of women to men must be rated as one of the most fantastic myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.

Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.

Hi,

I'm 63 years old and I'm looking for a gentleman to spend time with. He must be active and basically healthy. I like being at home but I like running the streets too. I like movies, museums, shows, live music, long walks, the ocean, coffee, and good conversation...and more.

I'm healthy, active, and I'm medium build, 5'9"".

I lean to the left politically, mostly. I'm somewhat environmentally conscious, (I'm mostly vegetarian/vegan but not always), and I'm not into organized religion, but I have spiritual interests.

I'm friendly, basically positive, open, and honest. I work to be a better person every day.

Time's-a-wastin', as they say. Let's hang out and have coffee.

I'm currently in LA looking to rent a room on a temporary or permanent basis because I want to move back here because this is where my friends and family are. I'm moving from Las Vegas.

See you soon?

I find myself in the midst of a dilemna. I will come right out with it: I'm a little bored. Between home and work, I am just going through too many of the same routines, and I would love to break the monotony, without harming my (or your) marriage. I would like to find an attractive, intelligent, professional married woman who finds herself in a similar position. Maybe we can email and/or text and make these work days a little more fun. I don't want to fall in love. I just want to feel a little more life. It is also very important that this woman be close to my age. I am truly open to ALL races and ethnicities.

This is strictly for free. I'm a pretty good photographer but want to use my camera more often for experience. You will have to host or in a reasonably close outdoor area. I use natural light indoors or out. I do have a light setup and even green screen but am not going to haul my equipment all over for a first shoot setup unless I get to know you. I'll take candid shots or posed, fully clothed, boudoir or nude. Straight or kink (exceptions are animals, blood, scat or under age) I'm an older bi male, a bit kinky so am open to any kind of pictures you want or need. From straight face shots for portfolios to your own nudes or a bit kinky bi or hetro poses with a friend, wife or girlfriend.

You keep all pics except for any you allow me to add to my portfolio to show what I can do. I'm also very good with video if you have your own camera and need personal video. And I do have editing programs, both pictures and video.

I only have time afternoons or early evenings during the week and it must be at your place or reasonably close outdoor area.

IN YOUR FIRST EMAIL, tell me what type of photos you want, where you are located and if you have the time... ONLY afternoon or early evenings during he week. I don't mind spending a few hours shooting if needed.

Any hint of spam goes right into trash I don't want to waste my time or yours.

I am looking for new friends. People who understand you do not have to spend cash to have a good time. Artistic creative people. 

If you are the type of person who wants to play a game of checkers and say we can't because we don't have a board. Get out of here. That attitude is pee-pee. You should respond. Lets grab some rocks and etch a checkerboard into the ground and play. That is how it is done. lol

I am not necessarily looking to date. I want friends and if things go from there that is chill as well.

So if you are down to meet up, chill, and draw some chalk. Hit me up.
If you want to know who I am ask. I'll send you a link to everything you would need to know.


In Addition: 
- Sending a picture gets you brownie points and I will send one back. 
- It helps if you live close by. It is not an issue tho esp if you travel. lol
- Helps a lot if you are single and without children.
- I will not download any special communication apps or programs.

You've got questions.

Serious questions.

SUPER serious questions.

""What happened to a sense of wonder?""

""How do I rectify the natural human urge to make the world a better place with the reality of ultimately meaningless natural human obsessions?""

""What do I do when I realize being a grown up kind of sucks?""

""Where does this ennui come from?""

""Why is ennui such a funny word? It sounds like what a toddler would call his penis, an in-wee""

""Oh shit. Please stop thinking about that. The private parts of toddlers is never something that should be thought about, unless you're a pediatric urologist ""

""Is pediatric urology a real field? Or are they just pediatricians or urologists?""

Yes, we all have questions. Just hopefully not about pediatric urology.

Recently I realized I want a career in law enforcement... :) Its so discouraging when I have friends or current co-workers ask about what I want in the future, I tell them that I'm working on getting into shape to go to the police academy and if I'm not getting a dirty look, I get a one word responses, or how much they hate this or hate that. I think it's pretty sad to see so many young people not even encouraging others who want to better a community they've been apart of their whole life, to make their world or maybe even their future kid's community a more safe place. Instead I get backlash.



I feel like I should just keep it a secret, but at the same time I'm so proud of myself for getting this far, getting over the intimidation of all the what ifs and working towards something so great. 



I guest I'm just looking for like minded people or a few words of encouragement, its always nice to read some supporting words while I'm working hard towards something so big.

In a nut shell, I'm currently living in VA where I can't find work (in this little town I live in) I'm living with my family, and have no way of making a life for myself. I'm young guy not living life and am just existing from day to day.
I want to branch out and find a better life, find love, and a sense of identity. 
I'm looking to see if there are any generous top guys out there who would be willing to fly me out to LA and help me build a new life. I'm also looking for some kind of relationship, so I'm not gonna use you and loose you, if you get the metaphor.
I'm someone with a lot to offer and of course would be willing to pay you back once I'm back on my feet again.
Sometimes life is lonely and we need help from our fellow man to make changes in our lives, right?

Hey. I'm looking for a relationship with someone that's real. I'm tired of being single but I refuse to just settle for anybody. I'm 28, fun, cool, down to earth with a great sense of humor. Spiritual and open minded. I am honest, adventurous, free spirited, intelligent and loyal. I enjoy reading, studying, writing and LOVE music and learning new things.

I'm looking for someone similar to myself. Older or slightly younger. It doesn't matter. If you think that we may be compatible send a reply. It would be better to send a pic for a pic as well.
do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers

Hey there,

I'm up late looking to chat with someone. No hidden agenda (I can kinda see that that statement really doesn't count for much here on CL LOL) But anyways, I'm looking for a new buddy. I need someone that would like to spend sometime at movies maybe a swap meet here and there....Oh! And possibly a beer or cup coffee and just chat. 

About me I'm Hispanic guy in his late 20s, I like making people laugh (still don't know if they're laughing at me or with me LOL)...um yes I have a career...no I don't want your money and I definitely don't want to ""help you out financially"" LOL

About you, just be chill. Hopefully you like to have endless conversations on random subjects and like to laugh and like friendly banter. 

Sorry not 4/20 friendly, don't care if you do but I don't. But I dont mind hanging out with Ms Molly here and there ;) 

If you're interested in chatting, reply with your favorite Simpsons character in the title. (Sorry gotta weed out the bots and scammers)

Happy Craigslisting!

Some ads are for people who love dogs, this is for people who love tennis. Who's going to Indian Wells? Bummer about Fed being out. I'm guessing Joker will roll through everyone, but would be nice to see some other people step up. What's the big deal about Sharapova and whatever drug she was taking, she's skinny as a rail. Not that I'll miss her grunting. 

As the ad states, tennis is a big interest to me. Looking for others that enjoy playing and watching tennis. My game is not bad at the moment, probably a 3.5 but can hang with better players, I have skill and the fundamentals down, just need more consistency and practice. 

Looking for light hearted people and interaction.

Well I'm not sure how far I will get with this because for some people it's always about sex and not the actually nature of the ad. So here goes...what's up! I'm looking for a serious workout partner! I do work at a gym and I had some trainers but due to a little financial situation I had to stop, but I still need to hit the gym or just basically exercise on a regular...but it's hard to stay motivated on the real, so I was hoping if I had some one to workout with it would make it easier. I work 3rd shift so ideally someone that would be available in the afternoons or even early evenings or so would be great. If you have to do mornings that will be fine, I will just have to bring my workout clothes along with me. You don't have to be in the best shape of course but at least look as if though you've seen the inside of a gym or weights or something. I have a few workout plans and dvds but to have that push would be great as well. Anyway hit me up if you are interested and tell me your goals as well. If you have a group of friends that would like to join or that you work out with, that would be great since we can all motivate each other.

What's up! I'm looking for a serious workout partner. I do work at a gym and I had some trainers but due to a little financial situation I had to stop, but I still need to hit the gym or just basically exercise on a regular and I need to do it hard...but it's hard to stay motivated on the real, so I was hoping if I had some one to workout with it would make it easier. I do have T25, Insanity, Hip Hop abs etc and that's cool but I get bored easily and I want to lift some weights as well. Like I stated before I work for a gym. 24 hour fitness to be exact. I'm trying to lose 20 lbs or so and we can help support each other. I'm putting this into the strictly platonic section because my priority is to get a workout partner. I am not looking for sex or anything of that nature for real. It would help if you do have a membership at a 24 hour fitness and is somewhat fit or active/athletic. 

Email me if you are interested and tell me about yourself.

The complete historical subjugation of women to men must be rated as one of the most fantastic myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.
Jane Fall. Feminism is a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave

Pat Robertson-right wing Christian evangelist. A woman reading Playboy feels like a Jew reading a
Nazi manual. Gloria Steinem. The more famous and powerful I get, the more power I have to hurt

feminists who are anxious to force us to regard the sexes as completely equal in portion and worth.
Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

so the honest truth to begin this ad with is that I am married. I am NOT unhappily married nor is my marriage in any way difficult. I'm just looking for something more. I guess you can say I want something exciting and the idea of an affair has always excited me. In the end I think it's in our human nature to always want more than what we have. Or in other words sometimes we are just selfish. 

I would enjoy having an affair with a woman who maybe finds herself in the same situation as I do or someone who just find the idea of being with a married man exciting. As far as age is concerned I would prefer someone between the ages of 20 thru 32. anyway hope to hear from you.

The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

I'm looking for more than just a one time goodnight text otherwise I wouldn't be posting but I hope the title got your attention 

Anyways please send a picture, a name, and a little about yourself and I'll do the same 

I hope to hear from a cute girl soon because I'm sleepy but can't fall asleep 

I feel like I'm the only normal guy that ever posts on Craigslist which I think helps me stand out but it doesn't do me any good if I can't get any girls to actually mean what they say when they email me nice things lol 

Blah, I'm basically a dork with swagger and a king with confidence but just wants to be treated and loved equally

Friends first; lets get to know each other!!

I am looking to make new friends. Any good relationship starts out as friends first and in due time can evolve into a meaningful relationship. Someone who just wants to have a good time without pressure, be yourself and I will do the same. Personally I am an easy going, laid back can be funny as hell, very sarcastic and like to laugh rarely get stressed or become angry. I will make fun of you as well of myself. Life is short so I just like to enjoy the days as they go by. I will at times do random acts of kindness to others just to make myself feel better and to make our world a better place for all. As to what I like to do the laundry list can go on and on, but will try almost anything once. Some of the things I enjoy most are trying new restaurants (ethnic ones with a green B in the window) road trips speeding to our destination, the outdoors and cooking and yes I am a good cook. Quiet moments together just enjoying the company of one and other; lets not forget acting our shoe size not our age.

One thing that is very important to me is that you are an honest and real, a kind and caring person who speaks the truth. Someone who has feelings and is not afraid to express then, help each other out in both times of good and bad.I don't care what you do fore work or where you live or what you drive, just be a good hearted and a real person that hard to find this city we call home. Ideally I am looking for someone who is a least 35.

What I would like to get out of this post, is to make some new friends and maybe just maybe a best friend and a lover. Someone to grow old and grey and tooth-less with and have medacare buy us a pare of Hoverrounds.

I always see really cool guys walking around and I always wish I was their buddy. Someone that got to hangout with them, let them take the lead, be helpful, and listen to them. If you're a cool straight guy and are okay with having a nice mellow buddy like me to boss around and let be helpful to you, let me know. If we watch tv together you can tell me to bring you a drink, or if you want someone to go with you to run an errand im your guy.

I am looking to make new friends on here. Might sound strange but I'd always nice to meet new people with similar interests. 

-I am a 26 years old Latino, 6'1ft, green eyes and very short hair. 
-UCLA and USC alumni. 
-Traveler: Belize, Mexico, Guatemala, Spain, and Africa, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, and Texas. 
-I have an ENFP personality. 
-Currently working two part time jobs. 
-I am professional working in higher education institutions. 
-Born and raised in south central LA. 
-Come from a big family, but seriously tho. 
-I love to make others laugh and be silly and goofy. I am considered to be the class clown. -Life is too short to waste it on negative things. 
-Not too much into sports unless UCLA and/or USC plays. 
-Not as physically active as I should be, but I am working on it this year. #2016goals
-Do not have a Disneyland AP but visit multiple times throughout the year. 
-I plan to obtain my Ph.D. and do research focusing on remedial education at community colleges. 

Lastly, I am seeking a friendship with someone with similar interests. I am over guys just trying to hook up, that's just not my priority anymore. Let's start off as friends and take it from there. I am not a superficial type of guy nor someone that sets expectations of education, background, age, race, or professionalism. Just please be respectful as I am myself. I look forward to meeting someone I can relate to and go from there.

Hi!!
If you're pregnant and feeling lonely I'd love to take you out to dinner, or a movie, and just make you feel special. Nothing creepy or sexual, simply a chance to make a new friend and maybe both of us can feel a little better along the way. I think pregnant women are beautiful and I don't think there's any shame in that. I'm a down-to-earth, funny guy who just wants to try something new. It doesn't hurt that I'm also a great listener and conversationalist!

Holding each other close, snuggling, and enjoying each other's presence is a great way to relax into bliss and feel good. No sex or happy ending. Perhaps a full body, amateur massage followed by rest and some TLC would feel nice. Looking for average, h/w proportionate, clean cut Straight/Bi/Gay males yearning for nurturing touch, connection and kindness. All ages are welcome. Be who you are, be free of that social persona, feel good, and rest/relax in the safety of caring affection. A friendly cuddle reduces stress and anxiety, is healthy for body and soul, develops trust, is an instant way to come alive and certainly is great for feeling bonded to another. Having a good heart is what this is all about. Affection, Friendship, Caressing, Massage, Hugging, Care, Tactile, Respect, Trust, In-Spirit, and Feeling Safe -- Wow Terms! Let me know if there is any interest in this. I am Caucasian, h/w proportionate, understanding, and discreet looking for similar -- plus there is never a charge. We simultaneously have the opportunity to experience some inner freedom and wholeness in the present moment through touch.

I'm a college educated native to the Bay Area but enjoy traveling a lot and meeting new people. I work my 40+ hours , I'll go out for drinks, I work out a lil bit, donate money and time to charities, love the outdoors, indoors, music, movies, and mayhem. I can vibe in the streets or in suites.

I am looking for a road dog to have good times with and open to gay, bi, or straight buddies. Anything from drinking and gaming pals to helping each other hunt for action and getting into trouble. I live in the East Bay, but travel to La on business and to see family alot.... so it would be nice to have someone to hang out with and vibe with when I come to town. I've notoriously been a good wing man since I have no problem talking to ladies and usually go to regular bars (too bad I'm not really into women, but lately I've been curious hahaha). I could really use some guy pals though, just throwing this out there into the universe to see what comes back.If you like what you see hit me on snapchat- LuckyFella13.

If you are interested in chatting, hit me. I won't bite.

Hey ladies, 
I am female, 25 years old.

I am an executive assistant and I am looking for a driver. 

I am looking for a female driver with a valid drivers license. 

I will pay 10$ an hour for rides. 

**** I make websites and with my new assistant position I can not find the time to make websites. I would love for the driver I hire to want to learn how to make websites. I want to give website development jobs to the driver I hire. There's a beautiful place to work where I work, while I'm doing work the driver would be building websites. If you don't have a computer that's okay, I have a computer you can use and I will teach and assist with any complications that come with web building. 

This may sound complicated, life is wild and I am very serious about this.

I paint, draw, sculpt, love life, design, I make music, learn new things everyday, I am on point. I'd love to find another girl who is on point and ready to learn & work.

My schedule is almost unpredictable so I'm looking for the right person who has a lot of time on their hands....

Only females reply, I do not want to spend any amount of time with guy, especially if I'm paying for the time lol... 


*** there's no sexual or weird things attached to this... I am a female, I am straight.

*** I do not do illegal things
this is for rides to work, errands, events, anything/ everything. 

*** I'd like to set up interviews asap so please reply if you think I'm looking for you. 

Thanks everyone !
Stay Blessed :)

Also, don't hate on 10 per hour, I wish I could pay more, that's why I'm coupling the job with website building so the person I hire can make money in more ways than one.

Very serious here though about finding a buyer...Looking for someone serious to buy my stuff...
If you want to cum over to my place (in NOHO) and check out the stuff in person, totally cool. Try them on, make sure they fit.
Basically, I'm a motivated seller. ;) My KIK is hotfacedbud

Please possibly-Allow Us: 2 FIND work as an apt. management team 2 live rent FREE!

Aloha Human Honey,

I seek to team up with you and LOCATE apartment management work together! We can be partners as living-work-room-dream-mates to enjoy the benefit of FREE RENT if we collect it and account for it. Please consider my proposal to be my apprentice and associate to establish an apartment management and/or supervision team. 
You are welcome 2 co-exist; with me here in Temecula, CA: until we locate work. 
This is a career opportunity requiring honest happy intelligence; providing flexibility to develop other sources of income and achieve personal goals. Many positions require a TEAM to administrate and supervise maintenance. I promise: I can work and live together joyously; because the joy of a good job and luxurious living space predicate dreams of Love. I am trilingual Love/Spanish/English with 10 years experience managing apartments in the Southern California area. Your abilities and beauty add to our resume especially if you know another language.
Ladies are more compatible to me; psychologically, philosophically, physically, psychically, and politically: therefore; I seek a Lady work partner, to share living space because working together daily; is easy with pleasant personalities and an honest desire for lucrative longevity. Being a team mate facilitates acquiring work: as a Human Resource person advised me; ""I would hire you: BUT; our insurance doesn't want a lonely guy with the keys to beautiful peoples' apartments"". I promise to cooperate and handle our lack or enjoyment of a sexual reality with dignity; according to our eternal compatibilities and your desires. 
There are three ways we can prosper; 1. We locate work as business apprentice-associate-partners and employees to receive a salary and an apartment to reside in, 2. Contract work as Absolute Supervision my company to earn a percentage of; the gross collected rents we collect, 3. We buy with a zero $ down payment deal; we submit generous purchase proposals benefitting seller to acquire and operate apartment buildings. 
Every month our rent will be free plus a salary which depends on amount of units we manage and our responsibilities: or we develop a cash flow from buildings we acquire. It is easy to enjoy being rewarded for: executive honesty to collect rents and manage fairly/equally so tenants can quietly enjoy their apartment homes. Some positions have expensive building rents; therefore, housing is not included. Thus, we earn a generous salary, live off-site at an income property we purchase and own together.
All conditions are negotiable; and we shall respect the promises we establish.
1. We can exist harmoniously and enjoy life where we dream, eat, work and exercise. 
2. I shall respect your privacy and will abide by all living conditions we agree to.
3. I exist as a EVO-lacto-vegetarian; yet, I appreciate all appetites.
4. I am 420 compatible; I party with moderation to celebrate life socially
I am a dignified professional: upgrading my career, I shall excel with an effervescent partner. Our mutual cooperation will earn us a new apartment home with responsibilities to orchestrate a functional housing complex that enhances the community. I have the willingness to work anywhere in Southern California. I am well researched 'cultural vulture'; I co-exist with all cultures of people joyfully and I enjoy the best from all ethnicities to promote and establish world peace with prosperity. I an avid advocate and member of the US GREEN tea PARTY because: we must help our global village avoid extinction! Our World SOUL-U-tion; is #LOVEvolution: first end hunger, then dissipate hate, vanquish violence, dismantle nuclear reactor/weapons, and cure cancers! Thank you: your time and consideration are appreciated.
My offer for a live in apprenticeship: is contingent on our compatibility; I appreciatively consider all offers for barter, work, lodging, counseling, and especially Love.
JESUS, GOD and scientific Logic command: LOVE your neighbor; and bake Love-cake. 
Mahalo Peace and Love all ways: Robert aka mr-funsun.	
p.s. In my LIFE: seduction begins in a Lady's heart: thus; if you are not attracted to me, I can forget romance and excel at profitability while we help preserve oxygen and water to establish human dignity for all. I promise to adhere to our agreement and exist in harmony: because; I respect and adore ladies, my final sexual fantasy is to create babies. I produce peoples' dreams; not seduce people, I exist to help people achieve contentment.

I also own a self-employed business, that I am actively involved in. I take care of myself, and participate in physical activities and eat healthy, but I am not a gym nut. I am looking for a cute girl that I can hang out with and just have a good conversation about anything other than a night life or Vegas.

Long story short, I'm looking for someone that would be interested in trading beauty services regularly. What i want is simple- Head to Toe MASSAGES. No license required. Interest is all that matters & makes all the difference). As a licensed and certified Esthetician I tend to be on the giving end more so than receiving lol. Overdue doesnt even describe the half of it. Sometimes women forget what it feels like to pampered and catered to... that's so me! Even better if its you too. I'm not looking for anything else. Not trying to hook up, but give you the perfect hook up that benefits us both! Even potentially the start of an awesome friendship. Spoil yourself with steam facials, stunning eyelash extensions, body scrubs, waxing & my signature head to toe massages. Don't wait, interested, we can start asap!

No flakes, I'm serious and legit. Great opportunity for someone on the same level!

I know all married men say this but in this case it is true and I can prove it. My wife works long hours and I am so lonely. I have never cheated and don't plan to start. I just want a nice woman to talk to via phone, text, video chat. We can also hang out from time to time at a mall, or go shopping. I love going out to lunch and I would love someone to dine with. If you have some free time and would love a respectful, married man to pass the time with who will NOT try to sleep with you, please reach out to me with your photo. After all, you see me. It's only fair I see you.

I am an Asian undergrad who is working, working out, and working out the kinks in life. I'm learning to be more open to new people around me. I am more comfortable to meet over near a coffee place or shopping plaza to get to know anyone. 

Its a goal of mind to make at least one friend of each ethnicity. So far I am lacking any friends that are White/Black/Indian/Etc. Basically I only have Asian friends. Age wise, I hope you would be around at least 20 but at most 34. I feel that a decade more than my age would count enough to be my life mentor's age rather than a friend. Let me know of your ideas about what would be fun to do. 

I hope to learn more about what it means to carry friendships that are not only deep but wide. Please send a picture and we could talk from there.

Are there any cute girls (or women) -- of any legal age -- who might like to kick back this afternoon, have a toke, hang out, meet someone new, and sure, MAYBE even get naked, although that is not necessary? 

I'm a guy, basically easygoing, intelligent, even fun. I can even make you laugh -- whether with me or at me, who cares. I'm sure I could make you happy.

I'm fairly flexible about what we do, but generally just hang and yes, maybe get naked, although that is not required, just an idea to enhance things and get your attention. Maybe talk, or we can listen to music, or watch a video (I have several very good ones on hand), go for a walk in the park -- sure, any of that MAYBE naked (except the park, of course). Tell me your ideas, I'm open to whatever. I would simply enjoy the company, regardless of what we might do, and it doesn't have to be naked. Hey, maybe we even will make a new friend. Or more.

I'm older, middle age, so you have to be OK with that -- whether you're older, younger, it all works for me. Either way, even if an age difference, I'm sure you would be comfortable with me, I'm cool enough. We should trade pics when I hear from you; again, I think you will be satisfied.

So there you go. Get in touch -- the day is only getting older.

Hello,

My name is Brendan and I am a 24 year old gay male. I recently relocated from Seattle to LA. My roommate is having family visit for the month of March. I agreed that because he has a few family members coming to stay, that I would find a couch to surf for the month. This has proven more difficult than I expected. I have been staying with my friend who lives in DTLA however parking is extremely expensive and I cannot come and go as I please in the parking lot that is available. Currently, I am working in nightlife on the weekends and am looking for social work jobs. In the past I have worked with foster youth. 

I am looking for a couch to surf in LA. I am a friendly, outgoing person who enjoys doing yoga, having a beer, and meeting new people. I would not be apposed to helping out around the house in exchange for a place to crash for a few nights. 

Feel free to ask any questions you may have.

This is Danielle again.

I just moved in to a new place and already, my roommate is switching the rules on me. So I'm going to start looking for somewhere else to go. Idealy near Burbank, Glendale or Pasadena. Or Van Nuys, North Hollywood.

Last time I looked I had people contact me from Thousand Oaks. That's just TOO far. So please, if you don't have anything in the cities I've mentioned, don't waste your time asking, thank you.

I am clean, quiet and dependable. I am between work assignments, so I can pay rent, just don't have enough for a deposit on top of rent. I work in the entertainment industry as an executive assistant.

I can afford between $400-$500 a month max.

I am a 48-year-old, 6ft, 150lb., straight, white male, who grew up in a Jewish household, but without my father in the picture, and without being part of or subject to a lot what is involved in raising a Jewish child, i.e. without a Tanakh in the household.

Over the years, I have found the fact of not having a father around has been a tremendous void, and is one that I am now seeking to fill.

Specifically, what I am looking for are weekly sessions, for however long that day that they would take, which would feature three parts:

1. TANAKH (GENERALLY WEEKLY TORAH & HAFTORAH PORTIONS) - We would read both in advance (I would read in English, as I only made it through 4 years of Hebrew school), and we would discuss the meanings, and specifically, the values that can be derived from each.

2. PERSONAL, FATHERLY ADVICE - I would present to you one to three issues that I have been having in my life, and you would provide your best fatherly advice on those issues, drawing on your life experience, Jewish law, or whatever other source you can bring to bear. I grew up without getting a lot of critical input that my father wasn't around to provide, so I am trying to make up for that.

3. DISCIPLINE - POTCH IN TUCHUS - Proverbs 10:17 provides that ""He who follows discipline shows the way to life, but he who ignores reproof leads astray.""--JPS Hebrew English Tanakh, 1999. 

In this phase of our meetings, I would present an issue or behavior which I have committed, for which I feel that I should be disciplined by my father. (I grew up without my father, and those that raised me chose not to spank me when I needed it, but many years ago, as a teen, or earlier, I recognized it would have been the right way to go for me, and would have helped me a great deal.)

Accordingly, after identifying the matter, I would present you with a razor strop, for your use; you, in turn, would tell me how many swats you thought I deserved, and if it was over 25, we would split it into sets. I would take that from you, face down on a bed, stripped to a jockstrap, and the hugs and comforting that would follow afterword, as you show your parental love for me . 

I know this type of accountability would have made a difference then, as I believe my real father would have done it to me, had he lived and stuck around to raise me -- and will now, with you serving in loco parentis. He was a proud Korean War vet, and must have been a tough guy, who would have commanded my unconditional respect fron a strap if it came to that.

Accordingly, if you are a Jewish male, age 48 on up, and are a traditional, old-school Jewish father figure or father, or believe you can fill that role on an ongoing basis, either once a week or once every two weeks, in sessions, please write with your age, stats, general location, experience, and your ability to host the sessions.

I know this is quite a lot to ask of one person, but if you feel you fit this bill, write me as I've requested above.

I have my circle of friends who I go out with from time to time and it's
nice, however I will like to meet someone or more than one person

to Meet up at least once a week for Happy hour or Coffee and vent
( call it some kind of therapy without the expensive hourly rate) LOL

We can talk about anything , We wont be there to judge. I think that we all
have a few skeletons in our closet. If you don't and you think that you are
perfect please do not contact me.

I like to go the this place in Los Feliz. If you are near that area, Hollywood or
LA ... We can meet up after work for an hour or two and we can talk about life, or any crazy
situation you might of encountered.


With this being CL and this posting already sounding crazy. Please I am not hear
for a hook up or a quicky , NO SEX at all


I would like you to be between 37 to 47, so we can have something in common to talk about
No Psychos and if you are please let me know , so it wont come as a surprise to me.

Be fun, if you are depressed that's cool , just don't expect a stranger to fix you, that has to come
from you.

I am Hispanic Attached , so Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays work for me.
So if you are available to meet up anytime after 6pm great we can have a few laughs , why not
if necessary shed some tears ( hopefully joyful tears)

** NO hate mail if you have no need to VENT or search for something that you, yourself have no Idea
what, but you keep searching through the CL adds in hopes of finding something . Please stop
yourself from sending me some silly email and telling me I am insane.. I might be more SANE than
you are!

If interested send me an Email on the Subject line put THERAPY, tell me who you are
and don't forget to add your name I hate to reply to emails with ( I don't know what to call
you)

myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.
Jane Fall. Feminism is a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave
their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.
Pat Robertson-right wing Christian evangelist. A woman reading Playboy feels like a Jew reading a
Nazi manual. Gloria Steinem. The more famous and powerful I get, the more power I have to hurt
men. Men use the night to erase us. Stella Adler. We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by
feminists who are anxious to force us to regard the sexes as completely equal in portion and worth.
Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

Hi there,

So this may seem out of place in the listings, but hey, I thought it was worth a shot. 

I find myself craving something in my life and I believe that that something is more solid and long term friendships with kind hearted, spiritual, open minded and compassionate individuals.

So you may think..why go all the way across the pond to find that?

I guess in a way I feel I have exhausted many friendship avenues here and believe somewhere like LA will may have a more eclectic and open minded group of individuals that I am struggling to find in the UK. 

I consider myself very open minded, I don't care about your sexuality, race or gender identity. I just ask that you are a honest, open and generally a good person. 

About me: I love thrift shopping, deep conversations, inspirational and uplifting movies, aswell as a good comedy, I have recently become a bit of a you tube addict ( I love Just Latasha, Kat Blaque, Just Between Us, Buzzfeed aswell as some great ASMR channels), I like theater shows, vintage events, festivals, travelling, learning about new cultures, I study psychology so I am also very interested in the inner workings of peoples minds. 

So if this sounds like anything you are interested in then please get in touch.

Hayley

Hi. Are you bored throughout the day like me? Are you not getting the attention at home that you require? Are you in a relationship that seems to be going nowhere? Are you staying because you have kids and don't want to change your situation? Do you feel that because you're curvy or have extra padding that no one finds your attractive? Well then we have something in common.. I'm Joe, and I unfortunately can answer yes to all these questions. So I'm here posting for someone like minded to become great friends with. A little bit about me....I'm a Hispanic man in my early 40's. I am a very compassionate and kind man. I like football, the walking dead, star wars, metal music. I do have a child. I love Disney and going to theme parks. I don't smoke or do drugs. I drink socially. Enjoy going to the beach and camping and fishing . Love sushi and food trucks. I love to read... Mostly history or historical fiction. I'm non judgmental and very honest. I miss having a connection with someone. I enjoy innocent flirting. I find women with curves or bbw to be very attractive. I'm kind of shy at first as I've been in a ltr for 10 plus years so don't really have much experience approaching women.... Thus a texting friend would seem to be the best way to meet someone new. I'm not looking to change my situation at this time as my daughter is 7 years old. I'm in the east San Gabriel valley in case location matters.

Hi. I'm Joe. I'm 42. I'm a Hispanic man. I'm looking for a best friend. Strictly platonic! I have a girlfriend of 14 years. I have one daughter turning 8. I'm looking for a buddy. Someone to hang out with occasionally with and without the family. I'm a die hard Ucla Bruin and Green Bay Packers fan. I enjoy camping and fishing. As a family we are really into Disney and Disneyland, although at the moment we do not have annual passes. I enjoy reading...mostly history or historical fiction. I'm into action and comedy movies. I'm a big The Walking Dead fan. I love food trucks... especially Grill'EmAll. I listen to mostly Alternative and metal... AC/DC, Metallica, The Offspring, Linkin Park, Green Day, Ozzy, etc. I enjoy playing my Xbox, but do not have Xbox Live... enjoy zombie related games Dead Rising, Dead island, The walking dead, SIM games.... Topico 4, Sid Meyers Civilization, first person shooter.... The Brother in Arms series. I feel funny having to post here looking for a friend, but over the years all my buddies have drifted away... Sometime I just need that male bonding that seems to have slipped away. I'm a normal guy... non judgmental, very respectful. I'm a social drinker, but never to excess. I do not smoke or do drugs, however I do enjoy a nice cigar once in a while. I'm hoping to find that buddy that will remain close friends for years to come. I do have Facebook and Twitter, so I'd we do become friends hopefully communication through social media will occur. Again this is for platonic friends only... at no time will there be anything otherwise. If you're interested in making a lifelong new friend, please respond.

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok

myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.
Jane Fall. Feminism is a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave
their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.
Pat Robertson-right wing Christian evangelist. A woman reading Playboy feels like a Jew reading a
Nazi manual. Gloria Steinem. The more famous and powerful I get, the more power I have to hurt
men. Men use the night to erase us. Stella Adler. We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by
feminists who are anxious to force us to regard the sexes as completely equal in portion and worth.
Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I'm 63 years old and I'm looking for a gentleman to spend time with. He must be active and basically healthy. I like being at home but I like running the streets too. I like movies, museums, shows, live music, long walks, the ocean, coffee, and good conversation...and more.

I'm healthy, active, and I'm medium build, 5'9"".

I lean to the left politically, mostly. I'm somewhat environmentally conscious, (I'm mostly vegetarian/vegan but not always), and I'm not into organized religion, but I have spiritual interests.

I'm friendly, basically positive, open, and honest. I work to be a better person every day.

Time's-a-wastin', as they say. Let's hang out and have coffee.

I'm currently in LA looking to rent a room on a temporary or permanent basis because I want to move back here because this is where my friends and family are. I'm moving from Las Vegas.

See you soon?

From straight face shots for portfolios to your own nudes or a bit kinky bi or hetro poses with a friend, wife or girlfriend.

You keep all pics except for any you allow me to add to my portfolio to show what I can do. I'm also very good with video if you have your own camera and need personal video. And I do have editing programs, both pictures and video.

I only have time afternoons or early evenings during the week and it must be at your place or reasonably close outdoor area.

IN YOUR FIRST EMAIL, tell me what type of photos you want, where you are located and if you have the time... ONLY afternoon or early evenings during he week. I don't mind spending a few hours shooting if needed.

If you want to know who I am ask. I'll send you a link to everything you would need to know.


In Addition: 
- Sending a picture gets you brownie points and I will send one back. 
- It helps if you live close by. It is not an issue tho esp if you travel. lol
- Helps a lot if you are single and without children.
- I will not download any special communication apps or programs.

I'm new to LA and I love everything outdoors including zoos, museums, and national parks. I find them fascinating!

I'm seeking a friend who also enjoys going to the zoo to come with me to the San Diego Zoo and / or Safari Park (they are two different locations). I have a dual membership that allows me to bring one person for free to both places. I'd like to go sometime this week / weekend. It's best if you can drive. 

I'm educated, employed professional, non-smoker, non-drug user, funny, cute, charismatic, outgoing, and pretty awesome! :-)

When you respond, please let me know a bit about you, your hobbies, and a pic. Oh, and any questions you have. I look forward to exploring the Zoo with you!

You've got questions.

Serious questions.

SUPER serious questions.

""What happened to a sense of wonder?""

""How do I rectify the natural human urge to make the world a better place with the reality of ultimately meaningless natural human obsessions?""

""What do I do when I realize being a grown up kind of sucks?""

""Where does this ennui come from?""

""Why is ennui such a funny word? It sounds like what a toddler would call his penis, an in-wee""

""Oh shit. Please stop thinking about that. The private parts of toddlers is never something that should be thought about, unless you're a pediatric urologist ""

""Is pediatric urology a real field? Or are they just pediatricians or urologists?""

Yes, we all have questions. Just hopefully not about pediatric urology.

Recently I realized I want a career in law enforcement... :) Its so discouraging when I have friends or current co-workers ask about what I want in the future, I tell them that I'm working on getting into shape to go to the police academy and if I'm not getting a dirty look, I get a one word responses, or how much they hate this or hate that. I think it's pretty sad to see so many young people not even encouraging others who want to better a community they've been apart of their whole life, to make their world or maybe even their future kid's community a more safe place. Instead I get backlash.



I feel like I should just keep it a secret, but at the same time I'm so proud of myself for getting this far, getting over the intimidation of all the what ifs and working towards something so great. 



I guest I'm just looking for like minded people or a few words of encouragement, its always nice to read some supporting words while I'm working hard towards something so big.

Hello, I'm Jorj. I'm 23, 5'10, 165lb. Brown hair/eyes. Bottom. 
In a nut shell, I'm currently living in VA where I can't find work (in this little town I live in) I'm living with my family, and have no way of making a life for myself. I'm young guy not living life and am just existing from day to day.
I want to branch out and find a better life, find love, and a sense of identity. 
I'm looking to see if there are any generous top guys out there who would be willing to fly me out to LA and help me build a new life. I'm also looking for some kind of relationship, so I'm not gonna use you and loose you, if you get the metaphor.
I'm someone with a lot to offer and of course would be willing to pay you back once I'm back on my feet again.
Sometimes life is lonely and we need help from our fellow man to make changes in our lives, right? 

I would be more than grateful to anyone asking my ad who is willing to help a stranger and make a difference in my life.

What happens once in a lifetime but everyday of your life? Answering or not answering this question has no impact on my decision to reply back...so don't sweat it.

Not that I'll miss her grunting. 

As the ad states, tennis is a big interest to me. Looking for others that enjoy playing and watching tennis. My game is not bad at the moment, probably a 3.5 but can hang with better players, I have skill and the fundamentals down, just need more consistency and practice. 

Looking for light hearted people and interaction.

Well I'm not sure how far I will get with this because for some people it's always about sex and not the actually nature of the ad. So here goes...what's up! I'm looking for a serious workout partner! I do work at a gym and I had some trainers but due to a little financial situation I had to stop, but I still need to hit the gym or just basically exercise on a regular...but it's hard to stay motivated on the real, so I was hoping if I had some one to workout with it would make it easier. I work 3rd shift so ideally someone that would be available in the afternoons or even early evenings or so would be great. If you have to do mornings that will be fine, I will just have to bring my workout clothes along with me. You don't have to be in the best shape of course but at least look as if though you've seen the inside of a gym or weights or something. I have a few workout plans and dvds but to have that push would be great as well. Anyway hit me up if you are interested and tell me your goals as well. If you have a group of friends that would like to join or that you work out with, that would be great since we can all motivate each other. 

Thank you

What's up! I'm looking for a serious workout partner. I do work at a gym and I had some trainers but due to a little financial situation I had to stop, but I still need to hit the gym or just basically exercise on a regular and I need to do it hard...but it's hard to stay motivated on the real, so I was hoping if I had some one to workout with it would make it easier. I do have T25, Insanity, Hip Hop abs etc and that's cool but I get bored easily and I want to lift some weights as well. Like I stated before I work for a gym. 24 hour fitness to be exact. I'm trying to lose 20 lbs or so and we can help support each other. I'm putting this into the strictly platonic section because my priority is to get a workout partner. I am not looking for sex or anything of that nature for real. It would help if you do have a membership at a 24 hour fitness and is somewhat fit or active/athletic. 

Email me if you are interested and tell me about yourself.

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

so the honest truth to begin this ad with is that I am married. I am NOT unhappily married nor is my marriage in any way difficult. I'm just looking for something more. I guess you can say I want something exciting and the idea of an affair has always excited me. In the end I think it's in our human nature to always want more than what we have. Or in other words sometimes we are just selfish. 

I would enjoy having an affair with a woman who maybe finds herself in the same situation as I do or someone who just find the idea of being with a married man exciting. As far as age is concerned I would prefer someone between the ages of 20 thru 32. anyway hope to hear from you.

Hello, I'm looking for someone to help me to learn to dance to spanish music better than I do now. I'm not bad (atleast thats what I believe) but I'm not that good at it either. I would like to get better to have enough confidence to ask someone to dance at parties or clubs. Im in my mid 30's and Mexican and single, looking for someone close to my age to teach me. Nothing sexual or misleading. I would want this to be something discrete. Kind of an embarrassing thing for me

Are any women on here for real?

I'm seeking a fun, outgoing, activity/cuddle partner to spend time with and have fun.

Why do things alone when you can have fun and laughs together? I love to be out and enjoy the day as much as stay in and enjoy each others company. I workout when I can and love the beach. I love to kiss and cuddle (kissing optional since this is strictly platonic) and make people laugh and smile.

If you are bored, lonely and looking for fun companionship, take a chance and come say hello. You never know what could happen if you just take a chance.

I don't have a specific type or preference. Be fun, sexy, love to laugh and have a sarcastic side and we'll get along great.

I really hope to hear from you.

Friends first; lets get to know each other!!

I am looking to make new friends. Any good relationship starts out as friends first and in due time can evolve into a meaningful relationship. Someone who just wants to have a good time without pressure, be yourself and I will do the same. Personally I am an easy going, laid back can be funny as hell, very sarcastic and like to laugh rarely get stressed or become angry. I will make fun of you as well of myself. Life is short so I just like to enjoy the days as they go by. I will at times do random acts of kindness to others just to make myself feel better and to make our world a better place for all. As to what I like to do the laundry list can go on and on, but will try almost anything once. Some of the things I enjoy most are trying new restaurants (ethnic ones with a green B in the window) road trips speeding to our destination, the outdoors and cooking and yes I am a good cook. Quiet moments together just enjoying the company of one and other; lets not forget acting our shoe size not our age.

One thing that is very important to me is that you are an honest and real, a kind and caring person who speaks the truth. Someone who has feelings and is not afraid to express then, help each other out in both times of good and bad.I don't care what you do fore work or where you live or what you drive, just be a good hearted and a real person that hard to find this city we call home. Ideally I am looking for someone who is a least 35.

What I would like to get out of this post, is to make some new friends and maybe just maybe a best friend and a lover. Someone to grow old and grey and tooth-less with and have medacare buy us a pare of Hoverrounds.

Where do you live, a zip code will work. Just want to make shore were both in the same time zone?

What decade where you born in?

Should I be a monkey suite or jeans and tee shirt person?

Are you just as happy eating at an ethnic restaurant with a green B in the window as you might be at a fine dining restaurant?

I am looking to make new friends on here. Might sound strange but I'd always nice to meet new people with similar interests. 

-I am a 26 years old Latino, 6'1ft, green eyes and very short hair. 
-UCLA and USC alumni. 
-Traveler: Belize, Mexico, Guatemala, Spain, and Africa, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, and Texas. 
-I have an ENFP personality. 
-Currently working two part time jobs. 
-I am professional working in higher education institutions. 
-Born and raised in south central LA. 
-Come from a big family, but seriously tho. 
-I love to make others laugh and be silly and goofy. I am considered to be the class clown. -Life is too short to waste it on negative things. 
-Not too much into sports unless UCLA and/or USC plays. 
-Not as physically active as I should be, but I am working on it this year. #2016goals
-Do not have a Disneyland AP but visit multiple times throughout the year. 
-I plan to obtain my Ph.D. and do research focusing on remedial education at community colleges. 

Lastly, I am seeking a friendship with someone with similar interests. I am over guys just trying to hook up, that's just not my priority anymore. Let's start off as friends and take it from there. I am not a superficial type of guy nor someone that sets expectations of education, background, age, race, or professionalism. Just please be respectful as I am myself. I look forward to meeting someone I can relate to and go from there.

SooOoOoo I haven't gone to Disneyland in over a month!! Can you believe that?? What kind of person am I?? I just got another pass this year and I want to use it to the fullest! 😜 I usually go with my sister but since her BF got a pass they go together now blah blah and I don't want to be the third wheel while going with them. So it's time I find a Disney buddy, or squad whatever. I would go alone but who goes to Disneyland alone?? That's no fun. But yeah I haven't gone to Disneyland and I bet it's so beautiful right now since it's almost Spring ugHhh! 
Put your favorite thing to do at Disneyland in the subject line if you want to reach out to me.

Holding each other close, snuggling, and enjoying each other's presence is a great way to relax into bliss and feel good. No sex or happy ending. Perhaps a full body, amateur massage followed by rest and some TLC would feel nice. Looking for average, h/w proportionate, clean cut Straight/Bi/Gay males yearning for nurturing touch, connection and kindness. All ages are welcome. Be who you are, be free of that social persona, feel good, and rest/relax in the safety of caring affection. A friendly cuddle reduces stress and anxiety, is healthy for body and soul, develops trust, is an instant way to come alive and certainly is great for feeling bonded to another. Having a good heart is what this is all about. Affection, Friendship, Caressing, Massage, Hugging, Care, Tactile, Respect, Trust, In-Spirit, and Feeling Safe -- Wow Terms! Let me know if there is any interest in this. I am Caucasian, h/w proportionate, understanding, and discreet looking for similar -- plus there is never a charge. We simultaneously have the opportunity to experience some inner freedom and wholeness in the present moment through touch.

I'm a college educated native to the Bay Area but enjoy traveling a lot and meeting new people. I work my 40+ hours , I'll go out for drinks, I work out a lil bit, donate money and time to charities, love the outdoors, indoors, music, movies, and mayhem. I can vibe in the streets or in suites.

I am looking for a road dog to have good times with and open to gay, bi, or straight buddies. Anything from drinking and gaming pals to helping each other hunt for action and getting into trouble. I live in the East Bay, but travel to La on business and to see family alot.... so it would be nice to have someone to hang out with and vibe with when I come to town. I've notoriously been a good wing man since I have no problem talking to ladies and usually go to regular bars (too bad I'm not really into women, but lately I've been curious hahaha). I could really use some guy pals though, just throwing this out there into the universe to see what comes back.If you like what you see hit me on snapchat- LuckyFella13.

If you are interested in chatting, hit me. I won't bite.

Hey ladies, 
I am female, 25 years old.

I am an executive assistant and I am looking for a driver. 

I am looking for a female driver with a valid drivers license. 

I will pay 10$ an hour for rides. 

**** I make websites and with my new assistant position I can not find the time to make websites. I would love for the driver I hire to want to learn how to make websites. I want to give website development jobs to the driver I hire. There's a beautiful place to work where I work, while I'm doing work the driver would be building websites. If you don't have a computer that's okay, I have a computer you can use and I will teach and assist with any complications that come with web building. 

This may sound complicated, life is wild and I am very serious about this.

I paint, draw, sculpt, love life, design, I make music, learn new things everyday, I am on point. I'd love to find another girl who is on point and ready to learn & work.

My schedule is almost unpredictable so I'm looking for the right person who has a lot of time on their hands....

Only females reply, I do not want to spend any amount of time with guy, especially if I'm paying for the time lol... 


*** there's no sexual or weird things attached to this... I am a female, I am straight.

*** I do not do illegal things
this is for rides to work, errands, events, anything/ everything. 

*** I'd like to set up interviews asap so please reply if you think I'm looking for you. 

Thanks everyone !
Stay Blessed :)

Also, don't hate on 10 per hour, I wish I could pay more, that's why I'm coupling the job with website building so the person I hire can make money in more ways than one.

Mostly Calvin Klein trunks. Multiple colors. Small size which is usually for waist size 29 to 32.
Looking for ideally at least 10 bucks each so 100 total.
Male Escort here, if that matters to you. Yes, I'm hot and masculine, and a sexy fuck too. LOL I'm the one in the pic, and I'm 31, white, masculine, bearded, 5'10'' and hundred sixty pounds. Pic is of ME.
Very serious here though about finding a buyer...Looking for someone serious to buy my stuff...
If you want to cum over to my place (in NOHO) and check out the stuff in person, totally cool. Try them on, make sure they fit.
Basically, I'm a motivated seller. ;) My KIK is hotfacedbud

Please don't email me with just ""how much?"" Send me some details on you, when you are looking to come over and check them out and what you are offering.

Please possibly-Allow Us: 2 FIND work as an apt. management team 2 live rent FREE!

Aloha Human Honey,

I seek to team up with you and LOCATE apartment management work together! We can be partners as living-work-room-dream-mates to enjoy the benefit of FREE RENT if we collect it and account for it. Please consider my proposal to be my apprentice and associate to establish an apartment management and/or supervision team. 
You are welcome 2 co-exist; with me here in Temecula, CA: until we locate work. 
This is a career opportunity requiring honest happy intelligence; providing flexibility to develop other sources of income and achieve personal goals. Many positions require a TEAM to administrate and supervise maintenance. I promise: I can work and live together joyously; because the joy of a good job and luxurious living space predicate dreams of Love. I am trilingual Love/Spanish/English with 10 years experience managing apartments in the Southern California area. Your abilities and beauty add to our resume especially if you know another language.
Ladies are more compatible to me; psychologically, philosophically, physically, psychically, and politically: therefore; I seek a Lady work partner, to share living space because working together daily; is easy with pleasant personalities and an honest desire for lucrative longevity. Being a team mate facilitates acquiring work: as a Human Resource person advised me; ""I would hire you: BUT; our insurance doesn't want a lonely guy with the keys to beautiful peoples' apartments"". I promise to cooperate and handle our lack or enjoyment of a sexual reality with dignity; according to our eternal compatibilities and your desires. 
There are three ways we can prosper; 1. We locate work as business apprentice-associate-partners and employees to receive a salary and an apartment to reside in, 2. Contract work as Absolute Supervision my company to earn a percentage of; the gross collected rents we collect, 3. We buy with a zero $ down payment deal; we submit generous purchase proposals benefitting seller to acquire and operate apartment buildings. 
Every month our rent will be free plus a salary which depends on amount of units we manage and our responsibilities: or we develop a cash flow from buildings we acquire. It is easy to enjoy being rewarded for: executive honesty to collect rents and manage fairly/equally so tenants can quietly enjoy their apartment homes. Some positions have expensive building rents; therefore, housing is not included. Thus, we earn a generous salary, live off-site at an income property we purchase and own together.
All conditions are negotiable; and we shall respect the promises we establish.
1. We can exist harmoniously and enjoy life where we dream, eat, work and exercise. 
2. I shall respect your privacy and will abide by all living conditions we agree to.
3. I exist as a EVO-lacto-vegetarian; yet, I appreciate all appetites.
4. I am 420 compatible; I party with moderation to celebrate life socially
I am a dignified professional: upgrading my career, I shall excel with an effervescent partner. Our mutual cooperation will earn us a new apartment home with responsibilities to orchestrate a functional housing complex that enhances the community. I have the willingness to work anywhere in Southern California. I am well researched 'cultural vulture'; I co-exist with all cultures of people joyfully and I enjoy the best from all ethnicities to promote and establish world peace with prosperity. I an avid advocate and member of the US GREEN tea PARTY because: we must help our global village avoid extinction! Our World SOUL-U-tion; is #LOVEvolution: first end hunger, then dissipate hate, vanquish violence, dismantle nuclear reactor/weapons, and cure cancers! Thank you: your time and consideration are appreciated.
My offer for a live in apprenticeship: is contingent on our compatibility; I appreciatively consider all offers for barter, work, lodging, counseling, and especially Love.
JESUS, GOD and scientific Logic command: LOVE your neighbor; and bake Love-cake. 
Mahalo Peace and Love all ways: Robert aka mr-funsun.	
p.s. In my LIFE: seduction begins in a Lady's heart: thus; if you are not attracted to me, I can forget romance and excel at profitability while we help preserve oxygen and water to establish human dignity for all. I promise to adhere to our agreement and exist in harmony: because; I respect and adore ladies, my final sexual fantasy is to create babies. I produce peoples' dreams; not seduce people, I exist to help people achieve contentment.

I am looking for a cute girl that I can hang out with and just have a good conversation about anything other than a night life or Vegas.

Long story short, I'm looking for someone that would be interested in trading beauty services regularly. What i want is simple- Head to Toe MASSAGES. No license required. Interest is all that matters & makes all the difference). As a licensed and certified Esthetician I tend to be on the giving end more so than receiving lol. Overdue doesnt even describe the half of it. Sometimes women forget what it feels like to pampered and catered to... that's so me! Even better if its you too. I'm not looking for anything else. Not trying to hook up, but give you the perfect hook up that benefits us both! Even potentially the start of an awesome friendship. Spoil yourself with steam facials, stunning eyelash extensions, body scrubs, waxing & my signature head to toe massages. Don't wait, interested, we can start asap!

No flakes, I'm serious and legit. Great opportunity for someone on the same level!

Thank you and have a beautiful day!

I am an Asian undergrad who is working, working out, and working out the kinks in life. I'm learning to be more open to new people around me. I am more comfortable to meet over near a coffee place or shopping plaza to get to know anyone. 

Its a goal of mind to make at least one friend of each ethnicity. So far I am lacking any friends that are White/Black/Indian/Etc. Basically I only have Asian friends. Age wise, I hope you would be around at least 20 but at most 34. I feel that a decade more than my age would count enough to be my life mentor's age rather than a friend. Let me know of your ideas about what would be fun to do. 

I hope to learn more about what it means to carry friendships that are not only deep but wide. Please send a picture and we could talk from there.

Are there any cute girls (or women) -- of any legal age -- who might like to kick back this afternoon, have a toke, hang out, meet someone new, and sure, MAYBE even get naked, although that is not necessary? 

I'm a guy, basically easygoing, intelligent, even fun. I can even make you laugh -- whether with me or at me, who cares. I'm sure I could make you happy.

I'm fairly flexible about what we do, but generally just hang and yes, maybe get naked, although that is not required, just an idea to enhance things and get your attention. Maybe talk, or we can listen to music, or watch a video (I have several very good ones on hand), go for a walk in the park -- sure, any of that MAYBE naked (except the park, of course). Tell me your ideas, I'm open to whatever. I would simply enjoy the company, regardless of what we might do, and it doesn't have to be naked. Hey, maybe we even will make a new friend. Or more.

I'm older, middle age, so you have to be OK with that -- whether you're older, younger, it all works for me. Either way, even if an age difference, I'm sure you would be comfortable with me, I'm cool enough. We should trade pics when I hear from you; again, I think you will be satisfied.

So there you go. Get in touch -- the day is only getting older.

Hello,

My name is Brendan and I am a 24 year old gay male. I recently relocated from Seattle to LA. My roommate is having family visit for the month of March. I agreed that because he has a few family members coming to stay, that I would find a couch to surf for the month. This has proven more difficult than I expected. I have been staying with my friend who lives in DTLA however parking is extremely expensive and I cannot come and go as I please in the parking lot that is available. Currently, I am working in nightlife on the weekends and am looking for social work jobs. In the past I have worked with foster youth. 

I am looking for a couch to surf in LA. I am a friendly, outgoing person who enjoys doing yoga, having a beer, and meeting new people. I would not be apposed to helping out around the house in exchange for a place to crash for a few nights. 

Feel free to ask any questions you may have.

This is Danielle again.

I just moved in to a new place and already, my roommate is switching the rules on me. So I'm going to start looking for somewhere else to go. Idealy near Burbank, Glendale or Pasadena. Or Van Nuys, North Hollywood.

Last time I looked I had people contact me from Thousand Oaks. That's just TOO far. So please, if you don't have anything in the cities I've mentioned, don't waste your time asking, thank you.

I am clean, quiet and dependable. I am between work assignments, so I can pay rent, just don't have enough for a deposit on top of rent. I work in the entertainment industry as an executive assistant.

I can afford between $400-$500 a month max.

I am a 48-year-old, 6ft, 150lb., straight, white male, who grew up in a Jewish household, but without my father in the picture, and without being part of or subject to a lot what is involved in raising a Jewish child, i.e. without a Tanakh in the household.

Over the years, I have found the fact of not having a father around has been a tremendous void, and is one that I am now seeking to fill.

Specifically, what I am looking for are weekly sessions, for however long that day that they would take, which would feature three parts:

1. TANAKH (GENERALLY WEEKLY TORAH & HAFTORAH PORTIONS) - We would read both in advance (I would read in English, as I only made it through 4 years of Hebrew school), and we would discuss the meanings, and specifically, the values that can be derived from each.

2. PERSONAL, FATHERLY ADVICE - I would present to you one to three issues that I have been having in my life, and you would provide your best fatherly advice on those issues, drawing on your life experience, Jewish law, or whatever other source you can bring to bear. I grew up without getting a lot of critical input that my father wasn't around to provide, so I am trying to make up for that.

3. DISCIPLINE - POTCH IN TUCHUS - Proverbs 10:17 provides that ""He who follows discipline shows the way to life, but he who ignores reproof leads astray.""--JPS Hebrew English Tanakh, 1999. 

In this phase of our meetings, I would present an issue or behavior which I have committed, for which I feel that I should be disciplined by my father. (I grew up without my father, and those that raised me chose not to spank me when I needed it, but many years ago, as a teen, or earlier, I recognized it would have been the right way to go for me, and would have helped me a great deal.)

Accordingly, after identifying the matter, I would present you with a razor strop, for your use; you, in turn, would tell me how many swats you thought I deserved, and if it was over 25, we would split it into sets. I would take that from you, face down on a bed, stripped to a jockstrap, and the hugs and comforting that would follow afterword, as you show your parental love for me . 

I know this type of accountability would have made a difference then, as I believe my real father would have done it to me, had he lived and stuck around to raise me -- and will now, with you serving in loco parentis. He was a proud Korean War vet, and must have been a tough guy, who would have commanded my unconditional respect fron a strap if it came to that.

Accordingly, if you are a Jewish male, age 48 on up, and are a traditional, old-school Jewish father figure or father, or believe you can fill that role on an ongoing basis, either once a week or once every two weeks, in sessions, please write with your age, stats, general location, experience, and your ability to host the sessions.

I know this is quite a lot to ask of one person, but if you feel you fit this bill, write me as I've requested above.

Do you ever feel like talking to someone ,other than your friends, family or your

I have my circle of friends who I go out with from time to time and it's
nice, however I will like to meet someone or more than one person

to Meet up at least once a week for Happy hour or Coffee and vent
( call it some kind of therapy without the expensive hourly rate) LOL

We can talk about anything , We wont be there to judge. I think that we all
have a few skeletons in our closet. If you don't and you think that you are
perfect please do not contact me.

I like to go the this place in Los Feliz. If you are near that area, Hollywood or
LA ... We can meet up after work for an hour or two and we can talk about life, or any crazy
situation you might of encountered.


With this being CL and this posting already sounding crazy. Please I am not hear
for a hook up or a quicky , NO SEX at all


I would like you to be between 37 to 47, so we can have something in common to talk about
No Psychos and if you are please let me know , so it wont come as a surprise to me.

Be fun, if you are depressed that's cool , just don't expect a stranger to fix you, that has to come
from you.

I am Hispanic Attached , so Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays work for me.
So if you are available to meet up anytime after 6pm great we can have a few laughs , why not
if necessary shed some tears ( hopefully joyful tears)

** NO hate mail if you have no need to VENT or search for something that you, yourself have no Idea
what, but you keep searching through the CL adds in hopes of finding something . Please stop
yourself from sending me some silly email and telling me I am insane.. I might be more SANE than
you are!

If interested send me an Email on the Subject line put THERAPY, tell me who you are
and don't forget to add your name I hate to reply to emails with ( I don't know what to call

myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.
Jane Fall. Feminism is a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave
their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.
Pat Robertson-right wing Christian evangelist. A woman reading Playboy feels like a Jew reading a
Nazi manual. Gloria Steinem. The more famous and powerful I get, the more power I have to hurt
men. Men use the night to erase us. Stella Adler. We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by

Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.

Have you looked around for someone to talk to but found that good friends are hard to find? I'm looking for someone who is looking for sincere friendship. Someone to confide in to share life's victories and failures, ups and downs. To me that is sincere friendship. I think that in friendship there is no jealousy or competition. If this sounds like something might interest you, let me know. I'd like to make your acquaintance. I look forward to hearing from you.

Hi there,

So this may seem out of place in the listings, but hey, I thought it was worth a shot. 

I find myself craving something in my life and I believe that that something is more solid and long term friendships with kind hearted, spiritual, open minded and compassionate individuals.

So you may think..why go all the way across the pond to find that?

I guess in a way I feel I have exhausted many friendship avenues here and believe somewhere like LA will may have a more eclectic and open minded group of individuals that I am struggling to find in the UK. 

I consider myself very open minded, I don't care about your sexuality, race or gender identity. I just ask that you are a honest, open and generally a good person. 

About me: I love thrift shopping, deep conversations, inspirational and uplifting movies, aswell as a good comedy, I have recently become a bit of a you tube addict ( I love Just Latasha, Kat Blaque, Just Between Us, Buzzfeed aswell as some great ASMR channels), I like theater shows, vintage events, festivals, travelling, learning about new cultures, I study psychology so I am also very interested in the inner workings of peoples minds. 

So if this sounds like anything you are interested in then please get in touch.

Hayley

Hi. Are you bored throughout the day like me? Are you not getting the attention at home that you require? Are you in a relationship that seems to be going nowhere? Are you staying because you have kids and don't want to change your situation? Do you feel that because you're curvy or have extra padding that no one finds your attractive? Well then we have something in common.. I'm Joe, and I unfortunately can answer yes to all these questions. So I'm here posting for someone like minded to become great friends with. A little bit about me....I'm a Hispanic man in my early 40's. I am a very compassionate and kind man. I like football, the walking dead, star wars, metal music. I do have a child. I love Disney and going to theme parks. I don't smoke or do drugs. I drink socially. Enjoy going to the beach and camping and fishing . Love sushi and food trucks. I love to read... Mostly history or historical fiction. I'm non judgmental and very honest. I miss having a connection with someone. I enjoy innocent flirting. I find women with curves or bbw to be very attractive. I'm kind of shy at first as I've been in a ltr for 10 plus years so don't really have much experience approaching women.... Thus a texting friend would seem to be the best way to meet someone new. I'm not looking to change my situation at this time as my daughter is 7 years old. I'm in the east San Gabriel valley in case location matters.

Hi. I'm Joe. I'm 42. I'm a Hispanic man. I'm looking for a best friend. Strictly platonic! I have a girlfriend of 14 years. I have one daughter turning 8. I'm looking for a buddy. Someone to hang out with occasionally with and without the family. I'm a die hard Ucla Bruin and Green Bay Packers fan. I enjoy camping and fishing. As a family we are really into Disney and Disneyland, although at the moment we do not have annual passes. I enjoy reading...mostly history or historical fiction. I'm into action and comedy movies. I'm a big The Walking Dead fan. I love food trucks... especially Grill'EmAll. I listen to mostly Alternative and metal... AC/DC, Metallica, The Offspring, Linkin Park, Green Day, Ozzy, etc. I enjoy playing my Xbox, but do not have Xbox Live... enjoy zombie related games Dead Rising, Dead island, The walking dead, SIM games.... Topico 4, Sid Meyers Civilization, first person shooter.... The Brother in Arms series. I feel funny having to post here looking for a friend, but over the years all my buddies have drifted away... Sometime I just need that male bonding that seems to have slipped away. I'm a normal guy... non judgmental, very respectful. I'm a social drinker, but never to excess. I do not smoke or do drugs, however I do enjoy a nice cigar once in a while. I'm hoping to find that buddy that will remain close friends for years to come. I do have Facebook and Twitter, so I'd we do become friends hopefully communication through social media will occur. Again this is for platonic friends only... at no time will there be anything otherwise. If you're interested in making a lifelong new friend, please respond.

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

Hi, I'm a healer by nature and know how to make it all better :)
I also have strong healing hands. I would love to get some practice mastering my foot and back massage. I'm available so please say hi. I'm easy going but don't play games so please, let's honor and respect each other. I like to joke around and am told I'm funny with the right person. I have a website I can share with you so you can see who I am and what I'm about. You might find it interesting that I can connect people directly to angels. So there is angelic energy around me especially when I am inspired or moved to tears when I tell stories about ""Crystal Children."" The last time I did that orbs of light showed up around me and I have photos.

A girl who is laidback and easygoing with a sense of humor is my kind of girl. Not looking for anything serious, just a fun little getaway before we have to back to regular life.

Hi,

I'm 63 years old and I'm looking for a gentleman to spend time with. He must be active and basically healthy. I like being at home but I like running the streets too. I like movies, museums, shows, live music, long walks, the ocean, coffee, and good conversation...and more.

I'm healthy, active, and I'm medium build, 5'9"".

I lean to the left politically, mostly. I'm somewhat environmentally conscious, (I'm mostly vegetarian/vegan but not always), and I'm not into organized religion, but I have spiritual interests.

I'm friendly, basically positive, open, and honest. I work to be a better person every day.

Time's-a-wastin', as they say. Let's hang out and have coffee.

I'm currently in LA looking to rent a room on a temporary or permanent basis because I want to move back here because this is where my friends and family are. I'm moving from Las Vegas.

See you soon?

I would like to find an attractive, intelligent, professional married woman who finds herself in a similar position. Maybe we can email and/or text and make these work days a little more fun. I don't want to fall in love. I just want to feel a little more life. It is also very important that this woman be close to my age. I am truly open to ALL races and ethnicities.

This is strictly for free. I'm a pretty good photographer but want to use my camera more often for experience. You will have to host or in a reasonably close outdoor area. I use natural light indoors or out. I do have a light setup and even green screen but am not going to haul my equipment all over for a first shoot setup unless I get to know you. I'll take candid shots or posed, fully clothed, boudoir or nude. Straight or kink (exceptions are animals, blood, scat or under age) I'm an older bi male, a bit kinky so am open to any kind of pictures you want or need. From straight face shots for portfolios to your own nudes or a bit kinky bi or hetro poses with a friend, wife or girlfriend.

You keep all pics except for any you allow me to add to my portfolio to show what I can do. I'm also very good with video if you have your own camera and need personal video. And I do have editing programs, both pictures and video.

I only have time afternoons or early evenings during the week and it must be at your place or reasonably close outdoor area.

IN YOUR FIRST EMAIL, tell me what type of photos you want, where you are located and if you have the time... ONLY afternoon or early evenings during he week. I don't mind spending a few hours shooting if needed.

Any hint of spam goes right into trash I don't want to waste my time or yours.

I am looking for new friends. People who understand you do not have to spend cash to have a good time. Artistic creative people. 

If you are the type of person who wants to play a game of checkers and say we can't because we don't have a board. Get out of here. That attitude is pee-pee. You should respond. Lets grab some rocks and etch a checkerboard into the ground and play. That is how it is done. lol

I am not necessarily looking to date. I want friends and if things go from there that is chill as well.

So if you are down to meet up, chill, and draw some chalk. Hit me up.
If you want to know who I am ask. I'll send you a link to everything you would need to know.


In Addition: 
- Sending a picture gets you brownie points and I will send one back. 
- It helps if you live close by. It is not an issue tho esp if you travel. lol
- Helps a lot if you are single and without children.
- I will not download any special communication apps or programs.

I want to reiterate that I'm looking for platonic friendship and hang out budd(ies) to like grab a bite to eat, go to an event like art gallery or a show, out door activity, hiking, running, biking, parasailing, skiing, watching a movie, go beer / wine tasting, salsa dancing, grilling out, etc.

I'm 30, 6' tall, broad shoulders, hazel eyes, educated, young professional, fluent in multiple languages, well traveled, I don't smoke, have my own car, and live in DTLA.

Please email me with your basic info, some things about yourself, age, name, your hobbies, and if you have any plans for this weekend.

You've got questions.

Serious questions.

SUPER serious questions.

""What happened to a sense of wonder?""

""How do I rectify the natural human urge to make the world a better place with the reality of ultimately meaningless natural human obsessions?""

""What do I do when I realize being a grown up kind of sucks?""

""Where does this ennui come from?""

""Why is ennui such a funny word? It sounds like what a toddler would call his penis, an in-wee""

""Oh shit. Please stop thinking about that. The private parts of toddlers is never something that should be thought about, unless you're a pediatric urologist ""

""Is pediatric urology a real field? Or are they just pediatricians or urologists?""

Yes, we all have questions. Just hopefully not about pediatric urology.

Oh, and I guess a Craigslist post would not be complete without a cock pic, so here you go:

Recently I realized I want a career in law enforcement... :) Its so discouraging when I have friends or current co-workers ask about what I want in the future, I tell them that I'm working on getting into shape to go to the police academy and if I'm not getting a dirty look, I get a one word responses, or how much they hate this or hate that. I think it's pretty sad to see so many young people not even encouraging others who want to better a community they've been apart of their whole life, to make their world or maybe even their future kid's community a more safe place. Instead I get backlash.



I feel like I should just keep it a secret, but at the same time I'm so proud of myself for getting this far, getting over the intimidation of all the what ifs and working towards something so great. 



I guest I'm just looking for like minded people or a few words of encouragement, its always nice to read some supporting words while I'm working hard towards something so big.

Hello, I'm Jorj. I'm 23, 5'10, 165lb. Brown hair/eyes. Bottom. 
In a nut shell, I'm currently living in VA where I can't find work (in this little town I live in) I'm living with my family, and have no way of making a life for myself. I'm young guy not living life and am just existing from day to day.
I want to branch out and find a better life, find love, and a sense of identity. 
I'm looking to see if there are any generous top guys out there who would be willing to fly me out to LA and help me build a new life. I'm also looking for some kind of relationship, so I'm not gonna use you and loose you, if you get the metaphor.
I'm someone with a lot to offer and of course would be willing to pay you back once I'm back on my feet again.
Sometimes life is lonely and we need help from our fellow man to make changes in our lives, right? 

I would be more than grateful to anyone asking my ad who is willing to help a stranger and make a difference in my life.

About you, just be chill. Hopefully you like to have endless conversations on random subjects and like to laugh and like friendly banter.

Not that I'll miss her grunting. 

As the ad states, tennis is a big interest to me. Looking for others that enjoy playing and watching tennis. My game is not bad at the moment, probably a 3.5 but can hang with better players, I have skill and the fundamentals down, just need more consistency and practice. 

Looking for light hearted people and interaction.

Well I'm not sure how far I will get with this because for some people it's always about sex and not the actually nature of the ad. So here goes...what's up! I'm looking for a serious workout partner! I do work at a gym and I had some trainers but due to a little financial situation I had to stop, but I still need to hit the gym or just basically exercise on a regular...but it's hard to stay motivated on the real, so I was hoping if I had some one to workout with it would make it easier. I work 3rd shift so ideally someone that would be available in the afternoons or even early evenings or so would be great. If you have to do mornings that will be fine, I will just have to bring my workout clothes along with me. You don't have to be in the best shape of course but at least look as if though you've seen the inside of a gym or weights or something. I have a few workout plans and dvds but to have that push would be great as well. Anyway hit me up if you are interested and tell me your goals as well. If you have a group of friends that would like to join or that you work out with, that would be great since we can all motivate each other.

I do work at a gym and I had some trainers but due to a little financial situation I had to stop, but I still need to hit the gym or just basically exercise on a regular and I need to do it hard...but it's hard to stay motivated on the real, so I was hoping if I had some one to workout with it would make it easier.

so the honest truth to begin this ad with is that I am married. I am NOT unhappily married nor is my marriage in any way difficult. I'm just looking for something more. I guess you can say I want something exciting and the idea of an affair has always excited me. In the end I think it's in our human nature to always want more than what we have. Or in other words sometimes we are just selfish. 

I would enjoy having an affair with a woman who maybe finds herself in the same situation as I do or someone who just find the idea of being with a married man exciting. As far as age is concerned I would prefer someone between the ages of 20 thru 32. anyway hope to hear from you.

In order to progress one has to practice outside of classes, so you would need to commit to ideally 2 days a week for a few hours. 

I will cover the cost of the classes for you to attend and provide the rope.

Physically you should be somewhat on the thinner side, but don't have to be athletic. Lastly and obviously a genuine interest to explore this art form.

I'm 25. I Wear glasses, blessed with a scruffy face (I hate it). I do not drive. I do not use drugs or drink. As for casual hook ups and all those xxxxxx xxxx xx, I'm sorry man. I dont sleep with strangers. I am old fashioned, I like that.

My height is 5'7""
140lbs. And my fitness goal is to trim fat as much as possible and build some muscle definition. So atm I have an average build.


Hispanic too, in college full time too, close to finally landing a stable job too. And on my free time I like to Jog, cook, lift weights, talk on the phone, hang out, anything good and safe that'll keep me away from netflix; (my gosh that site's addicting.)


I'm I guess DL... up to the person to decide. Im not feminine, nor masculine. Im like your regular joe, but to the trained eye you can tell I am into guys or just a real shy nice guy. but gay guys and girls always describe me as a conservative, assertive, cute, nice, funny, friendly, but my downfall is I dont put myself out there even though I have been looking for a while now.

I would love to first be friends. How quick we move forward is up to the chemistry.

I am out to my family, they support me and have no issues with my orientation. Im in school for a degree in psychology. I was an English major in HS. And last year I wanted to major in math rather than Psych. cuz I'm pretty good at math too. But I now realized counseling is my true calling.

Music is a tricky topic so I am not getting into that, ok, man?

Umm, ok. Well, looking forward to hear from you.

Hi, 

I'm the weirdest person you'll meet or you may 'get' me a little and then you'll maybe know more later on because I'm not shy at all but I'm quiet a lot of the time. 

I want to stay with someone who is positive, healthy, happy and peaceful. Non-judgemental is the only way because I'm not comfortable around people who have ideas about the way things 'should' be. I'm 28, Caucasian, tattooed, fit and healthy. I don't do drugs, smoke, drink. If you smoke 420 it's not an issue unless it's common. I like balance in an environment. 

Okay so you're probably wondering what I want and why I think it'll work out. I like adventures and experiences because I am studying runes (an ancient alphabet) while traveling randomly and meeting people of all sorts. It's like my own hobbit journey sort of, an epic journey. It's dangerous on craigslist doing this, and lots of people have told me I'm really crazy or they feel bad for me. I like what I'm doing and I'm very, very happy. 

If you have extra room and wouldn't mind having me around I would love to stay with you for a week. I have no money and I'll provide my own food of course and toiletries. 

I meditate in the mornings and study. After I go out into nature or do an odd job. Some times depending on where I'm staying I meet with friends who share similar interests. 

If you aren't spiritual or you think what I do isn't real or worth my time, it's okay. I know exactly what my goals are. Please please please don't assume I'm in trouble, need advice, a job, or anything. If you WANT to shelter a stranger for a week, awesome. 

Please be under 35.

34m seeks an open minded 420 friendly female to practice my massaging techniques on and ""pamper"" for a little while. I am open to all sizes, ages & races as long as you take care of your self. Personally I am not certified, but I am well trained with experience. If you could be interested please contact me and let me know about yourself. Of course just the normal things, age, location and maybe a pic or two. Also let me know where you are sore or if you just need to be pampered for an evening.

Real Simple, lets smoke. Talk a little and then I give you a long soothing massage in the comfort of your own home.

Hey I don't know if you saw my ad from last night or not but I'm going through the same thing 

Basically I've just been single so long after having been in long term serious relationships my entire adult life that now it's really starting to bother me not being able to talk to a girl before I fall asleep

I'm looking for more than just a one time goodnight text otherwise I wouldn't be posting but I hope the title got your attention 

Anyways please send a picture, a name, and a little about yourself and I'll do the same 

I hope to hear from a cute girl soon because I'm sleepy but can't fall asleep 

I feel like I'm the only normal guy that ever posts on Craigslist which I think helps me stand out but it doesn't do me any good if I can't get any girls to actually mean what they say when they email me nice things lol 

Blah, I'm basically a dork with swagger and a king with confidence but just wants to be treated and loved equally 

You feel me?

If you don't wanna text you can Kik me

Well, maybe this is a strange idea, but I thought maybe someone would like to talk on the phone and we could both express emotions! We could express emotions about relationships, life, anything. Happy, Sad, Angry, Bored, Funny...

Do you have some emotions? If not, we could just pretend. ;)

My current friends are amazing human beings but we all have different sets of interests that don't necessarily align which is why I'm here. I'm lucky enough to love what I do for a living, but when I'm not at work, I don't want to be working. I'm learning how to cook and I'm going out to watch movies more. I would love to hang out with a woman to share some of these fun experiences with. I'm even open to just hanging out and having a conversation whether it be important or non important. I'll send a face pic if you decide to reply to me. I'm very well mannered so don't be shy and message me. Hope to hear from you!

Aside from art, i also love (and have a passion for) horror movies.! I have a wide taste of films, but horror movies are my thing! Always looking for the latest thrill and chill :D
I have tons of other interests that would fill an entire page. I can be complex at times (definitely not boring) but overall im a very chill dude! 
Once i open up, i can be super fun! :)
I enjoy going to horror conventions (Monsterpallooza and Days of the Dead are on my list next :)
I dont go out alot because i lack companionship. I love oddities stores, gothic store, bookstores. To name a few places: Dark Delicasies, Freaks Antiques, Museum of Death, places like that. 
If u like my pics, shoot me a line :)
Would love to meet someone along my level. Thanks for reading.

Just relocated to CA from CT. Looking to explore all the fun things to do here.. Like I said looking for a hang out buddy. Doesn't matter what or who you are. Just be you. Man/women/straight/gay/trans/black/white/tan. No judgment here, just don't be an asshole.

Now I said I have no judgment, that doesn't mean other people don't. Now I'm short, fat (fluffy) and not the best thing to look at. Now the reason I state these facts is that ""I LIKE ME, just the way I am"" So if you have a problem being with someone like me, please don't bother. I don't need health tips. I have psoriasis, I don't want to know how you, your mothers uncle, you friends BFF just suddenly got then found a cure, and give me a shit ton of advice and meds to take to cure it. There is no cure...

I try always to be positive , I'm very eclectic in my likes in music, movies, books. I love Comic cons, book cons, casinos, concerts. The beach, walks, working out. Finding little book stores and cafes. Love my Zelda, Mario, D3. And when I get another comp WOW and Rift. Yes I am a geek and nerd.

Those are the only ""Labels"" I will give myself.

I am not looking for sex. Jeesh I can do that on my own. Just friends, hang out buddies, bitches that are in the know. Lol

I do have some deal breakers. Lies.....Smoking, I don't, also don't like the smell, there's no smoking in my car, home. I will not tolerate hate, racism, religious fanatics, closed minds.

Good day, hope your doing well and thank you for opening my ad. Am a 28 year old Latino looking for a female friend who is more into the nerd lifestyle of reading comics, watching movies, reading and going out to explore new places. I generally like going to the movies if I can find someone who can go with me, hint hint. I just discovered the New Beverly and love their double features, also trying to find new movie theatre like the new bev. One of my other nerdy pleasures is going to the comic shops to pick up the titles am reading and looking for new figures to add to my collection, but I rather go to Frank and Sons if am a pick up toys. Tv? Well I love the Simpsons, still my favorite to this day, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, True Detective, King of the Hill, and a bunch of old shows. Ok, lastly I also enjoy classic rock, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Queen, Rolling Stones etc.. But also enjoy other genres. And just as a final, just to take it out the way, I am aware that sometimes attractions are a bit strong and People bump uglies lol and not oppose to that, but only if it keeps the main thing which is the chemistry of having fun and enjoying each other's company without the physical aspect. Well hope your into some of the things am into, and if your not, it's cool, maybe we can learn something new from each other.

Hello, 
I'm a tall, muscular, dominant / aggressive bear type of cuddler. I have a four pack, and am a really nice person. I'm seeking someone that wants to share a very romantic moment with me. I'm the type of person that likes to touch, feel, and kiss slowly. I enjoy taking my time with partner, and actually opening up the opportunity to get intimate with her. I'm not the type of person that rushes into sex, I'm the type of person that loves taking his time. I'm looking for someone interested in cuddling for long periods of time near a fire-pit under the stars, or on a cold summer night in the sheets. Truly it doesn't have to be sex, I simply want to show someone absolute affection through cuddling, and touching. 
I'm the type of person that'll offer a soft kiss from your lips, to your ears, down your neck, and to your shoulder. My arms would be wrapped around my fragile partner and I'd pull her in so that she knows she's safe. (I have big arms). I've always wanted to take it a step further and bring out the candles, yet I've never had the opportunity to do so. 
If anyone is interested in cuddling, kissing, and being shown that absolute affection, please send me an email. I'm a young guy, not one of those creepy 50 year old men on CL. I'm also well aware that it's seldom to find people like me, because I enjoy taking my time. To me it's not just about the sex, It's more of an intimate role that I enjoy having. 
Feel free to email me. 
Your picture in exchange for mine. :) (I will send it after you send me yours) 
Ps I'm 23

i'm 35

i am a partner
i am an accountant

that about sums me up. what are my interests? i'm not even sure anymore. it seems as though time is passing me by. i am not sure why i decided to post on here but i feel i need to vent. it has been a few years of life seeming at a stand still, both at work and at home. routine. i miss laughing. i miss the caress of a lover. i miss being held, holding hands, i miss talking on the phone, i miss talking about how the day was. maybe you feel the same? i would like to chat with someone in the same situation or even if you are not. i do not want to be solicited for sex. i am not looking to hook up with anyone. i would like to make contact with others, make friends, not sure if i would want to be sexual or not. just trying to get out of my comfort zone a little. i am 420 friendly. i watch a lot of tv shows and enjoy dvds, it has been a while since i went to a movie. i also like to play pool, it's been a while. bowling. i like to read. i would like to be more active and exercise more. good night.

So I'm not sure what I'm looking for at the moment. It would be great to maybe just trade some emails and chat a bit. It's been an odd night already. Admittedly, I'm in a bit of an odd place because of it, but good odd. It would just be nice to maybe connect with someone else. And with no expectations, chat, talk, get a drink, all sound interesting to me..


Sorry to be so cryptic, don't mean to be. I'm a guy in his 40's with a good sense of humor (about myself mostly) who works a lot, but tries to enjoy my time off. I'm white, tall, slim, easy going guy who has his moments (take that as you will) and can always keep the conversation going. Really, I'm just trying something different, because that's been the theme so far tonight..

Hi There,

Looking to cuddle today?

Maybe you're over the whole dating scene and have too busy of a schedule to get into a serious relationship? Or maybe you just want to try something new?

I'm Lee and I'd love to be your cuddle buddy for the day. I have been told that I'm a good listener and have a flexible body too. Other traits about me are that I'm 30, 5'10, 140 pounds, disease-free, and have caramel cappuccino complexion. I'm also a massage therapist by day so I can give good body rubs!

Please host and choose a spot where we can cuddle. Feel free to talk about anything you want as we feel and hold each other. I also have some nice spa music on my phone that can help set the mood. Remember this is a strictly platonic cuddle session, so nothing sexual. Please be kind and respectful of that, thanks!

If interested, please contact for rates.
show contact info
Thank you.

Warm Regards,

Lee

I'm an Asian guy, and very Americanized. I'm just looking for a platonic friend. Age 30 to 40, but doesn't matter too much as long as you're mature. I'm not interested in going to clubs or anything too crazy. I live in the South Bay and work in Westwood, so I can hang out anywhere near those two spots. My intent is to just find a friend to hang out with, grab a bite to eat, see a movie, etc. More than anything, I just like good interesting conversation. I've tried this a number of times, and met some cool people, but it usually fades out for one reason or another... boyfriend, not interested, etc....which is perfectly fine. But, I want to keep trying to meet more people.

I'm korean but I don't speak Korean. I'm very Americanized, but I love asian food, so maybe we can drive to K-town, or San Gabriel valley?

I'm not looking for a relationship, so please keep that in mind. This is for just friendship. No sex, no dating, no expectations, keep it simple.

I'll keep this short for now. Tell me something, anything, about yourself.

Again I'm not looking for a threesome. I enjoy the presence of beautiful women. I want a friend that i can just be comfortable with. Someone sexy who will dance with me and wont mind when I grab her titties lol. My husband is hands off with other women but still an exciting guy to have around. He's usually the life of the party until I warm up. Sometimes I'm not the best at breaking the ice.

If any of this sounds like a good time feel free to reply with a few pics and tell me something cool : )

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

Hello,

I hope as you come across this your day is going well. I am a young 25 year old straight male looking for a workout partner. I'm in decent shape but I'm really dedicated to stepping my fitness up a level. I need a cool person to workout with pretty regularly (3-5 days a week) and we can help keep each other honest and accountable. I would prefer someone who lives near West Covina and is younger or in great shape if an older age. 

I want to be clear I'm not looking for anything sexual. Just a workout partner and maybe friend if we click that way. I am 4/20 friendly but we don't need to go there because I mostly want a cool friend to workout with. I would love for us to have fun and enjoy working out. It doesn't have to be a daunting torturous activity.

Thanks for reading :-)

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

Hello! 

I'm looking for new friends to have nice fun conversations, hikes, drives, ski trips and days or evenings out. I want to get to know more people and see where it goes :-) 

I am English, blond, slim, healthy 5'6"" and still quite attractive - was educated at a top school in London, and I enjoy intelligent people, with minds of their own - you don't need to be politically correct with me!

I also enjoy art, and those who have traveled in Europe, and enjoy Italian or French culture and visiting Huntington Gardens, art galleries or ocean festivals. Love to snow ski and take local trips.

I live near Glendale/Montrose/Pasadena and enjoy fine-dining, elegant destinations (Newport Beach, Malibu, Santa Barbara) or a drive up the coast. I like to be a bit stylish or dress in hip jeans, and have lots of fun! 

Contact me if you have weekends free or a Friday off.

Lets meet of a simple coffee date or a drink first.

I was listening the radio the other day and the host was saying of all the numbers in numerology
The number that might be the best compatibility predictor is your credit rating.

If you think about it...a credit rating certainly does say something for character.
Would you trust your life to someone with 550 credit rating over someone with a 750 rating?
In my life I've come to see people are a lot like their credit rating.
If you know how your credit number is compiled then you know...you don't have to have a lot of money to have great credit.

That being said...if your credit rating is north of 700
My guess is your a responsible person and someone I might like to meet.

Hey! I'm about to turn 21 (March 26th!) and I'm looking for some female friends to hang out with.

I moved to Beverly Hills back in September and haven't really had much opportunity to socialize. So basically I have no friends out here.

I'm looking for a girl around my age who is drama-free, fun to talk to and hang out with, and doesn't want to do a ton of things. By this, I mean stuff like hiking or going to museums. I don't want a friendship where we have to go do a bunch of stuff. I want one where we just genuinely enjoy each other's company and can just sit around and talk or drink or something. Laid back.

Hopefully someone responds to this, I'm super bored.

I also have done Tantric massage for over 20 years. You can be male or female, couple or T-girl, any age or race. and if you're really open minded you may be able to join us if you like.

I'm looking for an open minded person with extra space and will exchange somehow or is into joining us or can use a bit of extra cash every month. Just a few hours in the afternoon and not more than 2 -3 times a month. Probably just once or twice a month actually. 

To those who will tell me to just ""get a hotel or motel room"" If I could afford that I would do that, duh! Have you checked the prices of hotel or hotel rooms lately? 

I'm looking for someone that has the space, just a private room in a house even. You don't want a full time renter but you either need some repairs or minor work around the house or are horny at times yourself and would like to play also or just would like a little extra cash every month to let us use a room. I can pay up to one hundred dollars a month depending on the room and how available it would be. Needless to say I'm looking for a very clean room, and extra room in your house or even your own bedroom, house or apartment. I did this before and was offered some places I wouldn't let my dog sleep in. 

I'm a non smoker, only rare glass of wine and even rarer 420 friendly. DD free. Very clean easy going, nice responsible older bi man. 

If you don't need the cash but have the space and don't mind my using it we can come to some other barter arrangement. I'm very handy and very open minded. 

If you reply please let me know in the first email where you are located. I'd prefer Valencia, Castaic, Stevenson Ranch or Sylmar area but a little further into the valley may be OK.

Like I said I've done this before so NO one liners, asking me to verify myself or sending me to another email address in your first email. But DO let me know where you are located in the first email. Thanks

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a

hello cl
never did i think i would be turning to this site to find friends but with my work schedule it is kind of hard to go out and make friends. not that it isnt hard enough to make friends nowadays with everyone always being on their phones/tablets/laptops.
all im looking for in FRIENDS, like the title says. we can email, kik, text (maybe), and maybe even hang out at some point. lets see where it goes.
i am 26, love listening to music, i love art (even though i cant draw for shit), sports, 420 friendly, drama free, single, no kids. i do work im not looking for handouts, i have a college degree and i have my own car. for those of you who care what a person looks like i am a bit on the bigger side.

please do not reply asking for a picture in your first email, if looks is what you are worried about move on because im not interested, we can trade pictures eventually
and also do not ask me to hang out on your very first message and then get butt hurt when i say no, if you made it this far into my ad you have read what i am looking for 

to make sure you are real, reply with your age on the subject line

Hello, 

I'm Biracial, bearded tall guy. Big, strong athletic build. I work a lot and have a crazy schedule, and I also go to school. 

I'm looking for a special woman that really would like to engage in a relationship based around adult nursing. Now I know that to some women this might seem like code for foreplay or just trying to disguise real intentions. In effort to put those concerns to rest, I will describe what I think ANR is. To me, ANR is the connection and intimate bond with a nurturing woman that goes beyond sex and is more intimate and emotional than it is physical.

I really love the bond created with a woman when engaging in nursing. It's exciting, tender and lovely. I'm a big, strong man and I'm looking for a woman that has a need to nurture and wants a man needs to takeoff the tough exterior with her, get to know each other, have good meaningful conversation, and then engage in long suckling sessions. Theres no need to be experienced. Although, suckling and the act of nursing can be quite sexual, I strongly prefer that we don't take it any farther than that.


I really don't care about so much about your appearance, personality is what I care about. Please be hygienic and clean. I don't discriminate! breast size doesn't matter, age, neither does body type (skinny, bbw or ssbbw is all great). Although, I would prefer a middle-aged woman, I understand matureness is a mindset not a number. I will surprise you with how mature and respectful I am. I am mobile and can come to you. 

Please reply if you think we could really develop a great relationship. Thanks.

The complete historical subjugation of women to men must be rated as one of the most fantastic myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.

sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

Hi ladies 👋😊,

I'm 22 years old looking for an awesome friend 👌. I live in Tampa, FL and I'm planning on moving back to LA on June. So I'm needing a friend to be my rock, while I start a new life. I'm into fashion and adventure 😊. I have my own car but no place to stay or a job which is my biggest concern 😞. Starting a new life is not easy, and you would have to be that awesome to help me 😁. If you are that friend, I will owe you big time! Which I would have to make up for it, once I get back on my feet. I'm loyal, open minded, and can be direct. But one thing for sure I'm always there for my friends 👌. I'm looking for someone who knows what they want, someone close to my age, fun, loyal, real, and spontaneous. I'm also trying to learn Spanish. So if you know how to speak Spanish fluently, you could be my teacher 😜.

Don't have a man in your life? Of course you don't otherwise you wouldn't be reading this. Tired of spending evenings and the weekends alone while your friends are with their boy friends or husbands? Don't have anyone to spend time with or cuddle up with under a blanket to watch a movie with? Tired of dating players or guys that don't want a relationship? Well maybe we can help each other. 

I am an up front honest guy. Very sincere, very loyal, and very loving. I'm 28. Tall, Dark, Handsome, and Educated. A woman doesn't have to have model looks for me to be attracted to her but she needs to be height/weight proportionate. 

I am a very monogamous man as I typically only even date one woman at a time let alone sleep with more then one woman. I am relationship oriented but am open to being casual. 

I am looking to find a special woman that I connect with on an emotional, intellectual, and physical level. Someone who is highly intelligent, active, and passionate as well as genuine and sincere. Someone who loves to make me feel like a man as much as I love to make her feel like a woman. 
Someone who believes in me, supports me, yet is honest with me because I am not perfect. The woman I find has always been out there, I just haven't been lucky enough to find her yet. Not only will we be passionate lovers and share a deep intimate connection, most importantly we will be best friends. She will be the last thing I see when I go to bed at night and the first thing I see when I wake in the morning. The question is, are you her?

Good morning CL community,

I'm in search of meeting someone that wants to engage in a longterm FWB situation built upon more than just sex. I feel the same way as many woman on this site where that sex only is not a fulfilling endeavor.

Ideally, we would become friends that enjoy talking with each other, meeting up outside of the bedroom, and genuinely enjoying each other's company.

Not looking for any commitment etc. Just an opportunity and experience to connect with someone on the same wave length.

Single, attached - I'm open to either. No judgments. Your life and choices are yours.

I'll share a photo with you if you're interested and we'll go from there.

Hello Ladies,
I'm not sure where to start. I'm hoping that I can find someone real who is going through a rough or boring relationship just as I have with someone who turned out to be to much of an opposite and just fake . I'm a very laid back outgoing person who is a total movie and music fanatic. I'm open to talking to anyone who wants someone to confided in or workout with if you live in the area or close by. I have a ton of interest outside of the few I've already mentioned. I truly just want someone I can be honest with who is nonjudgmental and open minded just as I am, and hopefully we can be really great friends or possibly more if it is meant to happen.

Just to give an idea of who I would hope to meet. A woman who likes some or all of the things listed below.
1. Tattoos 
2. Horror Movies 
3. Sci-fi/Comic book movies or TV shows 
4. MMA or any form of Martial Arts
5. Working out 
6. Variety of Movies and Music
7. Cars ( Imports or Muscle )
8. Trying new things 
9. All kinds of Foods and able to cook
10. The outdoors ( hiking, horseback riding, camping etc...)
11. Traveling
12. Thrill rides
13. Going out dancing
14. Movie nights 
15. Holidays
16. Enjoying life
17. Hard working 

This should give you an idea of who I am. I hope to meet this special person. When you reply put your favorite hobby in the subject line so I know your real.

I want to get to know more people and see where it goes :-) I want to be able to express myself and be as quirky and eccentric without having to hide anything. I am sarcastic most of the time haha, I love to laugh and if you know any bad puns I'm sure I'll laugh at them regardless haha. I'm pretty easy going, shy at first but once I open up I won't be able to shut up. Haha. I love to do many things/ have many interests. Whether it's exploring the city or hiking in the mountains. Concerts are always a blast, going to museums etc. Going to the movies as well. I'm up for anything really. The list goes on~ If we end up getting along and becoming friends that would be great.

The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and

level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate

Thanks for reading!

Maybe I'm posting in the wrong section, but when I posted on m4w, I received all sorts of pros propositioning me; not close to what I'm looking for. 

Unfortunately relationships are not perfect, nor am I. We have been together 25 years, deeply care, respect one another and not looking to change anything in my home life-nor anyone else's. The sad truth is, the sensual-sexual spark-is no longer what it once was; and I so miss it. If you're a woman, who unfortunately is experiencing the same/similar, than you can understand, and if you would be interested-open in exchanging a few emails and chat, see what happens, I'd like to hear from you. 

About me: race: Caucasian, body: average, height: 5'11"", weight: 210lbs, age: 52-married, education: college grad, employed: prof in banking/fin sector. Availability: week-day mornings before noon.

Ideally I'd like to find-meet a safe, down to earth woman, close to my age, that like me understands discretion, respectful of our private life's, limited to no expectations and with no ulterior motive other than, if we connect, we meet when schedules permit and is able to do so week-day mornings-normally from Nine am to Noon! I also need you to be hiv-, d/d free, no drama, a non-smoker for a safe, discreet FWB type of friendship; if it get to this. I prefer to exchange a couple of emails, that eventually leads to a platonic meeting for morning coffee, as we get to know one-another; if we connect I'd like more. If like me your missing what I'm missing and this resonates with you, lets chat. . .tell me about you, or anything you are comfortable talking about. Please, to avoid spam/bots, place the color of your eyes and location city on the subject line. I don't need a pic, but if you desire a pic it shall be Pic4Pic or a coffee meet!

So I thought I found the perfect MT, but I was wrong. 15 minutes into the massage, he started saying inappropriate things and asked if I wanted a sensual touch. Um, No and Fuck you! Do, let's try this again. 

PLEASE READ THE ADD AlL THE WAY THROUGH, BEFORE RESPONDING!!

I am a massage therapist who is in need of a good massage. I've been lifting heavier than usual and could use a good combo sports/deep tissue massage. I usually trade with my friends who are also therapist, but no one is available. Since this is strictly platonic, I don't care about your gender, if you're single, how often you workout or looks. All I care about is whether or not you are a Lmt or cmt and are knowledgeable about the human anatomy. You must be able to perform deep tissue and sports massage.
If you live in Woodland hills, that would be perfect! I'm looking for someone local.
This is STRICTLY PLATONIC! 
I have my own table and supplies. You can come to me or I to you. either way works for me. Once again, this is STRICTLY PLATONIC!! Race, sex, height and looks are of no importance to me.

So I haven't been out in years, I'm 29, never been married and don't have any kids. I've been fighting depression for as long as I can remember. I have finally got tired of the same thing over and over not doing anything about it. I would say I'm socially awkward but am able not to make an ass out myself. I'm looking for anyone that wants to go out and do normal things and meet new people. I don't care about looks (im not bad looking if that scares you off), all I care about is that we are able to break out of our wretched norm and be temporarily happy if that makes any sense. I would like to have a normal social life if it kills me cause i know that depression is doing a good job taking care of that. So if there is anyone out there going through the same thing or just wanna go out and have a couple of laughs maybe even go to the gym (i have an LA fitness membership) and set goals for accountability that would be fucken great. Even if it is once a month or whatever its better than nothing. Ok i fugured that I would stop here since it seems like I'm begging but what else can I do?

So I realize this is kind of an unusual request. I have a curiosity what this world is like. I'm 34 years old, single, professional firefighter. I am friends with and come across many different ""walks of life"" especially in my job. I do not however know anything about the celebrity world. I'm just curious to talk to someone that works in this type of business. Coffee, emailing, texting, a new friendship, I'm open to whatever. I don't even have to know you ID if you feel like just having a anonymous texting friend to converse with. I don't want to use you, I don't want your fame, your money, dirt for TMZ, or use you for my own agenda. I just want to get to know someone in this world that is very different than my own. In return I offer a perspective possibly a little more ""down to earth"" that what you might be used to. I'm very grounded, I have my life pretty well together, and feel like I have a very realistic perspective on the world. I'm just interested in meeting someone different and form interesting conversations out of it. I actually don't even live in the LA area but i visit fairly often if that makes a difference.

so the honest truth to begin this ad with is that I am married. I am NOT unhappily married nor is my marriage in any way difficult. I'm just looking for something more. I guess you can say I want something exciting and the idea of an affair has always excited me. In the end I think it's in our human nature to always want more than what we have. Or in other words sometimes we are just selfish. 

so I would enjoy having an affair with a woman who maybe finds herself in the same situation as I do or someone who just find the idea of being with a married man exciting. As far as age is concerned I would prefer someone between the ages of 20 thru 32. anyway hope to hear from you.

rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

I know this is a long shot, but honest abe didn't succeed in his first shot either.

I met this girl via craigslist. she had replied to a posting I had posted in casual encounters about me performing oral sex on her. We exchanged pictures, and sort of hit it off. We didn't end up meeting, but we talked, texted, and made intentions of being friends...Turned out she was a very outdoorsy kind of girl...like literally hiking everyday... as couple days transpired, she always talked about us getting together, hanging out, going hiking, and doing things together. However, ""things"" kept coming up, and she kind of ended up just blowing me off and shooting down the plans we would make.... It got to the point where she just ghosted me completely. This happened a couple of weeks ago... but I just haven't been able to shake this from my psyche.

It's not the fact we didn't hook up, but she projected herself as this sweet person, to only act and behave counterpoint to what she was portraying...I think that bothered me the most.

This weird experience created a couple of desires and unfulfilled wants in my mind. Where I am hoping that maybe...just maybe there is somebody out there...

That already goes hiking, or wants to --- but doesn't have a buddy to go hiking with --- or that their hiking buddy no longer really goes hiking with them. If we hit it off, I would be open to a more deeper and intimate connection.... if it doesn't pan out, at least we tried.

I would also like this moment to disclose that I am physically handicapped as well. As circumstances would have it, i was born without an arm, and leg, but I don't let that impair my mobility and enthusiasm for being an active person. I write this tidbit, so if you do decide to reply, you know about this going in, and aren't surprised later and feel I might have deceived you or this isn't what you wanted.

about me: fairly well educated, masculine guy, hairy with facial hair that i keep groomed/trimmed. deep voice, i'm about 6'1 feet tall and about 180 pounds. I enjoy a fine craft beer from time to time. 4:20 friendly, but its not a compulsory must...i don't want it to be the focal point of this post. No drugs, no stds, clean bill of health. Currently I am single, dating, but haven't quite met someone I can synergyze well with.

If you are seriously interested, please reply with your picture, age, location. A number would speed up this process and weed out the people that aren't serious.

lets give it a shot.

so the honest truth to begin this ad with is that I am married. I am NOT unhappily married nor is my marriage in any way difficult. I'm just looking for something more. I guess you can say I want something exciting and the idea of an affair has always excited me. In the end I think it's in our human nature to always want more than what we have. Or in other words sometimes we are just selfish. 

I would enjoy having an affair with a woman who maybe finds herself in the same situation as I do or someone who just find the idea of being with a married man exciting. As far as age is concerned I would prefer someone between the ages of 20 thru 32. anyway hope to hear from you.

Are any women on here for real?

I'm seeking a fun, outgoing, activity/cuddle partner to spend time with and have fun.

Why do things alone when you can have fun and laughs together? I love to be out and enjoy the day as much as stay in and enjoy each others company. I workout when I can and love the beach. I love to kiss and cuddle (kissing optional since this is strictly platonic) and make people laugh and smile.

If you are bored, lonely and looking for fun companionship, take a chance and come say hello. You never know what could happen if you just take a chance.

I don't have a specific type or preference. Be fun, sexy, love to laugh and have a sarcastic side and we'll get along great.

I really hope to hear from you.

Friends first; lets get to know each other!!

I am looking to make new friends. Any good relationship starts out as friends first and in due time can evolve into a meaningful relationship. Someone who just wants to have a good time without pressure, be yourself and I will do the same. Personally I am an easy going, laid back can be funny as hell, very sarcastic and like to laugh rarely get stressed or become angry. I will make fun of you as well of myself. Life is short so I just like to enjoy the days as they go by. I will at times do random acts of kindness to others just to make myself feel better and to make our world a better place for all. As to what I like to do the laundry list can go on and on, but will try almost anything once. Some of the things I enjoy most are trying new restaurants (ethnic ones with a green B in the window) road trips speeding to our destination, the outdoors and cooking and yes I am a good cook. Quiet moments together just enjoying the company of one and other; lets not forget acting our shoe size not our age.

One thing that is very important to me is that you are an honest and real, a kind and caring person who speaks the truth. Someone who has feelings and is not afraid to express then, help each other out in both times of good and bad.I don't care what you do fore work or where you live or what you drive, just be a good hearted and a real person that hard to find this city we call home. Ideally I am looking for someone who is a least 35.

What I would like to get out of this post, is to make some new friends and maybe just maybe a best friend and a lover. Someone to grow old and grey and tooth-less with and have medacare buy us a pare of Hoverrounds.


If you have read everything I have written great. Because there is so much spam or BS on these listings I will only reply back if you answer a few basic questions in no particular order.

Where do you live, a zip code will work. Just want to make shore were both in the same time zone?

What decade where you born in?

Should I be a monkey suite or jeans and tee shirt person?

Are you just as happy eating at an ethnic restaurant with a green B in the window as you might be at a fine dining restaurant?

I am looking to make new friends on here. Might sound strange but I'd always nice to meet new people with similar interests. 

-I am a 26 years old Latino, 6'1ft, green eyes and very short hair. 
-UCLA and USC alumni. 
-Traveler: Belize, Mexico, Guatemala, Spain, and Africa, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, and Texas. 
-I have an ENFP personality. 
-Currently working two part time jobs. 
-I am professional working in higher education institutions. 
-Born and raised in south central LA. 
-Come from a big family, but seriously tho. 
-I love to make others laugh and be silly and goofy. I am considered to be the class clown. -Life is too short to waste it on negative things. 
-Not too much into sports unless UCLA and/or USC plays. 
-Not as physically active as I should be, but I am working on it this year. #2016goals
-Do not have a Disneyland AP but visit multiple times throughout the year. 
-I plan to obtain my Ph.D. and do research focusing on remedial education at community colleges. 

Lastly, I am seeking a friendship with someone with similar interests. I am over guys just trying to hook up, that's just not my priority anymore. Let's start off as friends and take it from there. I am not a superficial type of guy nor someone that sets expectations of education, background, age, race, or professionalism. Just please be respectful as I am myself. I look forward to meeting someone I can relate to and go from there.

A friendly cuddle reduces stress and anxiety, is healthy for body and soul, develops trust, is an instant way to come alive and certainly is great for feeling bonded to another. Having a good heart is what this is all about. Affection, Friendship, Caressing, Massage, Hugging, Care, Tactile, Respect, Trust, In-Spirit, and Feeling Safe -- Wow Terms! Let me know if there is any interest in this. I am Caucasian, h/w proportionate, understanding, and discreet looking for similar -- plus there is never a charge.

I'm a college educated native to the Bay Area but enjoy traveling a lot and meeting new people. I work my 40+ hours , I'll go out for drinks, I work out a lil bit, donate money and time to charities, love the outdoors, indoors, music, movies, and mayhem. I can vibe in the streets or in suites.

I am looking for a road dog to have good times with and open to gay, bi, or straight buddies. Anything from drinking and gaming pals to helping each other hunt for action and getting into trouble. I live in the East Bay, but travel to La on business and to see family alot.... so it would be nice to have someone to hang out with and vibe with when I come to town. I've notoriously been a good wing man since I have no problem talking to ladies and usually go to regular bars (too bad I'm not really into women, but lately I've been curious hahaha). I could really use some guy pals though, just throwing this out there into the universe to see what comes back.If you like what you see hit me on snapchat- LuckyFella13.

If you are interested in chatting, hit me. I won't bite.

I am a blk/indian mixed guy undergrad working on social workers degree full time online. I'm learning to be more open to new people around me. I am more comfortable to meet at a coffee shop or café or mall for first meet up.

Age wise, I hope you would be around at least 25 but at most 45, not an age queen here. Let me know of your ideas about what would be fun to do, even amusement parks like Knotts and Disneyland are on the table!? 100% 420 friendly here so you should be too, you don't have to smoke it with but be fine with it, heck, I mite share mine with ya...mite, haa!!!

I hope to learn more about what it means to carry friendships that are wide. I am a well traveled man who has live in Europe for 5yrs and go back there at least once every few years. So I hope you are an interesting person if you so choose to respond. Please send a FACE picture (NOT A COCK SHOT GUYS) and we could go from there.

Hey ladies, 
I am female, 25 years old.

I am an executive assistant and I am looking for a driver. 

I am looking for a female driver with a valid drivers license. 

I will pay 10$ an hour for rides. 

**** I make websites and with my new assistant position I can not find the time to make websites. I would love for the driver I hire to want to learn how to make websites. I want to give website development jobs to the driver I hire. There's a beautiful place to work where I work, while I'm doing work the driver would be building websites. If you don't have a computer that's okay, I have a computer you can use and I will teach and assist with any complications that come with web building. 

This may sound complicated, life is wild and I am very serious about this.

I paint, draw, sculpt, love life, design, I make music, learn new things everyday, I am on point. I'd love to find another girl who is on point and ready to learn & work.

My schedule is almost unpredictable so I'm looking for the right person who has a lot of time on their hands....

Only females reply, I do not want to spend any amount of time with guy, especially if I'm paying for the time lol... 


*** there's no sexual or weird things attached to this... I am a female, I am straight.

*** I do not do illegal things
this is for rides to work, errands, events, anything/ everything. 

*** I'd like to set up interviews asap so please reply if you think I'm looking for you. 

Thanks everyone !
Stay Blessed :)

Also, don't hate on 10 per hour, I wish I could pay more, that's why I'm coupling the job with website building so the person I hire can make money in more ways than one.

Hey guys..... I got 10 pairs of used (but clean) underwear, in total (all pictured) that I'm looking to sell. 
Since it's probably not appropriate to sell at garage sale...lol....I figured I'd try to sell here. To clarify... I AM looking to sell all 10 to ONE guy. Maybe someone who enjoys used underwear... roleplay....
Mostly Calvin Klein trunks. Multiple colors. Small size which is usually for waist size 29 to 32.
Looking for ideally at least 10 bucks each so 100 total.
Male Escort here, if that matters to you. Yes, I'm hot and masculine, and a sexy fuck too. LOL I'm the one in the pic, and I'm 31, white, masculine, bearded, 5'10'' and hundred sixty pounds. Pic is of ME.
Very serious here though about finding a buyer...Looking for someone serious to buy my stuff...
If you want to cum over to my place (in NOHO) and check out the stuff in person, totally cool. Try them on, make sure they fit.
Basically, I'm a motivated seller. ;) My KIK is hotfacedbud

Please don't email me with just ""how much?"" Send me some details on you, when you are looking to come over and check them out and what you are offering.
I've done this before in the past and had a great experience... hoping to repeat

Please possibly-Allow Us: 2 FIND work as an apt. management team 2 live rent FREE!

Aloha Human Honey,

I seek to team up with you and LOCATE apartment management work together! We can be partners as living-work-room-dream-mates to enjoy the benefit of FREE RENT if we collect it and account for it. Please consider my proposal to be my apprentice and associate to establish an apartment management and/or supervision team. 
You are welcome 2 co-exist; with me here in Temecula, CA: until we locate work. 
This is a career opportunity requiring honest happy intelligence; providing flexibility to develop other sources of income and achieve personal goals. Many positions require a TEAM to administrate and supervise maintenance. I promise: I can work and live together joyously; because the joy of a good job and luxurious living space predicate dreams of Love. I am trilingual Love/Spanish/English with 10 years experience managing apartments in the Southern California area. Your abilities and beauty add to our resume especially if you know another language.
Ladies are more compatible to me; psychologically, philosophically, physically, psychically, and politically: therefore; I seek a Lady work partner, to share living space because working together daily; is easy with pleasant personalities and an honest desire for lucrative longevity. Being a team mate facilitates acquiring work: as a Human Resource person advised me; ""I would hire you: BUT; our insurance doesn't want a lonely guy with the keys to beautiful peoples' apartments"". I promise to cooperate and handle our lack or enjoyment of a sexual reality with dignity; according to our eternal compatibilities and your desires. 
There are three ways we can prosper; 1. We locate work as business apprentice-associate-partners and employees to receive a salary and an apartment to reside in, 2. Contract work as Absolute Supervision my company to earn a percentage of; the gross collected rents we collect, 3. We buy with a zero $ down payment deal; we submit generous purchase proposals benefitting seller to acquire and operate apartment buildings. 
Every month our rent will be free plus a salary which depends on amount of units we manage and our responsibilities: or we develop a cash flow from buildings we acquire. It is easy to enjoy being rewarded for: executive honesty to collect rents and manage fairly/equally so tenants can quietly enjoy their apartment homes. Some positions have expensive building rents; therefore, housing is not included. Thus, we earn a generous salary, live off-site at an income property we purchase and own together.
All conditions are negotiable; and we shall respect the promises we establish.
1. We can exist harmoniously and enjoy life where we dream, eat, work and exercise. 
2. I shall respect your privacy and will abide by all living conditions we agree to.
3. I exist as a EVO-lacto-vegetarian; yet, I appreciate all appetites.
4. I am 420 compatible; I party with moderation to celebrate life socially
I am a dignified professional: upgrading my career, I shall excel with an effervescent partner. Our mutual cooperation will earn us a new apartment home with responsibilities to orchestrate a functional housing complex that enhances the community. I have the willingness to work anywhere in Southern California. I am well researched 'cultural vulture'; I co-exist with all cultures of people joyfully and I enjoy the best from all ethnicities to promote and establish world peace with prosperity. I an avid advocate and member of the US GREEN tea PARTY because: we must help our global village avoid extinction! Our World SOUL-U-tion; is #LOVEvolution: first end hunger, then dissipate hate, vanquish violence, dismantle nuclear reactor/weapons, and cure cancers! Thank you: your time and consideration are appreciated.
My offer for a live in apprenticeship: is contingent on our compatibility; I appreciatively consider all offers for barter, work, lodging, counseling, and especially Love.
JESUS, GOD and scientific Logic command: LOVE your neighbor; and bake Love-cake. 
Mahalo Peace and Love all ways: Robert aka mr-funsun.	
p.s. In my LIFE: seduction begins in a Lady's heart: thus; if you are not attracted to me, I can forget romance and excel at profitability while we help preserve oxygen and water to establish human dignity for all. I promise to adhere to our agreement and exist in harmony: because; I respect and adore ladies, my final sexual fantasy is to create babies. I produce peoples' dreams; not seduce people, I exist to help people achieve contentment.

Hi we're K & - 23 & 28 - petite Asian female & tall white male.

Within the last year we've moved to LA, had a baby, and are adventuring around, meeting great people. We're both fun, smart people looking for a friend to hangout for movie night, cook a big meal, or explore Venice Beach, sites, cave exploration, a little of everything.

Send us a little about yourself, we are looking for someone who is positive, intelligent, and adventurous like we are.

I am looking for a cute girl that I can hang out with and just have a good conversation about anything other than a night life or Vegas.

Long story short, I'm looking for someone that would be interested in trading beauty services regularly. What i want is simple- Head to Toe MASSAGES. No license required. Interest is all that matters & makes all the difference). As a licensed and certified Esthetician I tend to be on the giving end more so than receiving lol. Overdue doesnt even describe the half of it. Sometimes women forget what it feels like to pampered and catered to... that's so me! Even better if its you too. I'm not looking for anything else. Not trying to hook up, but give you the perfect hook up that benefits us both! Even potentially the start of an awesome friendship. Spoil yourself with steam facials, stunning eyelash extensions, body scrubs, waxing & my signature head to toe massages. Don't wait, interested, we can start asap!

No flakes, I'm serious and legit. Great opportunity for someone on the same level!

Thank you and have a beautiful day!

I am an Asian undergrad who is working, working out, and working out the kinks in life. I'm learning to be more open to new people around me. I am more comfortable to meet over near a coffee place or shopping plaza to get to know anyone. 

Its a goal of mind to make at least one friend of each ethnicity. So far I am lacking any friends that are White/Black/Indian/Etc. Basically I only have Asian friends. Age wise, I hope you would be around at least 20 but at most 34. I feel that a decade more than my age would count enough to be my life mentor's age rather than a friend. Let me know of your ideas about what would be fun to do. 

I hope to learn more about what it means to carry friendships that are not only deep but wide. Please send a picture and we could talk from there.

Are there any cute girls (or women) -- of any legal age -- who might like to kick back this afternoon, have a toke, hang out, meet someone new, and sure, MAYBE even get naked, although that is not necessary? 

I'm a guy, basically easygoing, intelligent, even fun. I can even make you laugh -- whether with me or at me, who cares. I'm sure I could make you happy.

I'm fairly flexible about what we do, but generally just hang and yes, maybe get naked, although that is not required, just an idea to enhance things and get your attention. Maybe talk, or we can listen to music, or watch a video (I have several very good ones on hand), go for a walk in the park -- sure, any of that MAYBE naked (except the park, of course). Tell me your ideas, I'm open to whatever. I would simply enjoy the company, regardless of what we might do, and it doesn't have to be naked. Hey, maybe we even will make a new friend. Or more.

I'm older, middle age, so you have to be OK with that -- whether you're older, younger, it all works for me. Either way, even if an age difference, I'm sure you would be comfortable with me, I'm cool enough. We should trade pics when I hear from you; again, I think you will be satisfied.

So there you go. Get in touch -- the day is only getting older.

Hello,

My name is Brendan and I am a 24 year old gay male. I recently relocated from Seattle to LA. My roommate is having family visit for the month of March. I agreed that because he has a few family members coming to stay, that I would find a couch to surf for the month. This has proven more difficult than I expected. I have been staying with my friend who lives in DTLA however parking is extremely expensive and I cannot come and go as I please in the parking lot that is available. Currently, I am working in nightlife on the weekends and am looking for social work jobs. In the past I have worked with foster youth. 

I am looking for a couch to surf in LA. I am a friendly, outgoing person who enjoys doing yoga, having a beer, and meeting new people. I would not be apposed to helping out around the house in exchange for a place to crash for a few nights. 

Feel free to ask any questions you may have.

This is Danielle again.

I just moved in to a new place and already, my roommate is switching the rules on me. So I'm going to start looking for somewhere else to go. Idealy near Burbank, Glendale or Pasadena. Or Van Nuys, North Hollywood.

Last time I looked I had people contact me from Thousand Oaks. That's just TOO far. So please, if you don't have anything in the cities I've mentioned, don't waste your time asking, thank you.

I am clean, quiet and dependable. I am between work assignments, so I can pay rent, just don't have enough for a deposit on top of rent. I work in the entertainment industry as an executive assistant.

I can afford between $400-$500 a month max.

I am a 48-year-old, 6ft, 150lb., straight, white male, who grew up in a Jewish household, but without my father in the picture, and without being part of or subject to a lot what is involved in raising a Jewish child, i.e. without a Tanakh in the household.

Over the years, I have found the fact of not having a father around has been a tremendous void, and is one that I am now seeking to fill.

Specifically, what I am looking for are weekly sessions, for however long that day that they would take, which would feature three parts:

1. TANAKH (GENERALLY WEEKLY TORAH & HAFTORAH PORTIONS) - We would read both in advance (I would read in English, as I only made it through 4 years of Hebrew school), and we would discuss the meanings, and specifically, the values that can be derived from each.

2. PERSONAL, FATHERLY ADVICE - I would present to you one to three issues that I have been having in my life, and you would provide your best fatherly advice on those issues, drawing on your life experience, Jewish law, or whatever other source you can bring to bear. I grew up without getting a lot of critical input that my father wasn't around to provide, so I am trying to make up for that.

3. DISCIPLINE - POTCH IN TUCHUS - Proverbs 10:17 provides that ""He who follows discipline shows the way to life, but he who ignores reproof leads astray.""--JPS Hebrew English Tanakh, 1999. 

In this phase of our meetings, I would present an issue or behavior which I have committed, for which I feel that I should be disciplined by my father. (I grew up without my father, and those that raised me chose not to spank me when I needed it, but many years ago, as a teen, or earlier, I recognized it would have been the right way to go for me, and would have helped me a great deal.)

Accordingly, after identifying the matter, I would present you with a razor strop, for your use; you, in turn, would tell me how many swats you thought I deserved, and if it was over 25, we would split it into sets. I would take that from you, face down on a bed, stripped to a jockstrap, and the hugs and comforting that would follow afterword, as you show your parental love for me . 

I know this type of accountability would have made a difference then, as I believe my real father would have done it to me, had he lived and stuck around to raise me -- and will now, with you serving in loco parentis. He was a proud Korean War vet, and must have been a tough guy, who would have commanded my unconditional respect fron a strap if it came to that.

Accordingly, if you are a Jewish male, age 48 on up, and are a traditional, old-school Jewish father figure or father, or believe you can fill that role on an ongoing basis, either once a week or once every two weeks, in sessions, please write with your age, stats, general location, experience, and your ability to host the sessions.

I know this is quite a lot to ask of one person, but if you feel you fit this bill, write me as I've requested above.

I know that this might come across as crazy, but maybe not

Do you ever feel like talking to someone ,other than your friends, family or your
partner?

I have my circle of friends who I go out with from time to time and it's
nice, however I will like to meet someone or more than one person

to Meet up at least once a week for Happy hour or Coffee and vent
( call it some kind of therapy without the expensive hourly rate) LOL

We can talk about anything , We wont be there to judge. I think that we all
have a few skeletons in our closet. If you don't and you think that you are
perfect please do not contact me.

I like to go the this place in Los Feliz. If you are near that area, Hollywood or
LA ... We can meet up after work for an hour or two and we can talk about life, or any crazy
situation you might of encountered.


With this being CL and this posting already sounding crazy. Please I am not hear
for a hook up or a quicky , NO SEX at all


I would like you to be between 37 to 47, so we can have something in common to talk about
No Psychos and if you are please let me know , so it wont come as a surprise to me.

Be fun, if you are depressed that's cool , just don't expect a stranger to fix you, that has to come
from you.

I am Hispanic Attached , so Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays work for me.
So if you are available to meet up anytime after 6pm great we can have a few laughs , why not
if necessary shed some tears ( hopefully joyful tears)

** NO hate mail if you have no need to VENT or search for something that you, yourself have no Idea
what, but you keep searching through the CL adds in hopes of finding something . Please stop
yourself from sending me some silly email and telling me I am insane.. I might be more SANE than
you are!

If interested send me an Email on the Subject line put THERAPY, tell me who you are
and don't forget to add your name I hate to reply to emails with ( I don't know what to call
you)

myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.
Jane Fall. Feminism is a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave
their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.
Pat Robertson-right wing Christian evangelist. A woman reading Playboy feels like a Jew reading a
Nazi manual. Gloria Steinem. The more famous and powerful I get, the more power I have to hurt
men. Men use the night to erase us. Stella Adler. We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by
feminists who are anxious to force us to regard the sexes as completely equal in portion and worth.
Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man these days? Lauren Bacall.
We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage. Robin Morgan.
Men often admit other women are oppressed, but not you. Emily Logan. Pornography is to sex what
what McDonalds is to food. A plasticized version of the real thing. Kate Sofer I think, therefore I
am single. Elizabeth Cutler Many women, I think, resist feminism because it is an agony to be fully
conscious of the brutal misogyny which permeates culture, society, and all personal relationships.
Connie Frank. No woman is required to build the world by destroying herself. Isn't Julia Swift.
Isn't that the problem? That women have been swindled for centuries into substituting adornment for love, fashion (as it is) for passion. Jennifer Jayson.

Hi there,

So this may seem out of place in the listings, but hey, I thought it was worth a shot. 

I find myself craving something in my life and I believe that that something is more solid and long term friendships with kind hearted, spiritual, open minded and compassionate individuals.

So you may think..why go all the way across the pond to find that?

I guess in a way I feel I have exhausted many friendship avenues here and believe somewhere like LA will may have a more eclectic and open minded group of individuals that I am struggling to find in the UK. 

I consider myself very open minded, I don't care about your sexuality, race or gender identity. I just ask that you are a honest, open and generally a good person. 

About me: I love thrift shopping, deep conversations, inspirational and uplifting movies, aswell as a good comedy, I have recently become a bit of a you tube addict ( I love Just Latasha, Kat Blaque, Just Between Us, Buzzfeed aswell as some great ASMR channels), I like theater shows, vintage events, festivals, travelling, learning about new cultures, I study psychology so I am also very interested in the inner workings of peoples minds. 

So if this sounds like anything you are interested in then please get in touch.

Hayley

I'm a big The Walking Dead fan. I love food trucks... especially Grill'EmAll. I listen to mostly Alternative and metal... AC/DC, Metallica, The Offspring, Linkin Park, Green Day, Ozzy, etc. I enjoy playing my Xbox, but do not have Xbox Live... enjoy zombie related games Dead Rising, Dead island, The walking dead, SIM games.... Topico 4, Sid Meyers Civilization, first person shooter.... The Brother in Arms series. I feel funny having to post here looking for a friend, but over the years all my buddies have drifted away... Sometime I just need that male bonding that seems to have slipped away. I'm a normal guy... non judgmental, very respectful. I'm a social drinker, but never to excess. I do not smoke or do drugs, however I do enjoy a nice cigar once in a while. I'm hoping to find that buddy that will remain close friends for years to come. I do have Facebook and Twitter, so I'd we do become friends hopefully communication through social media will occur.

The complete historical subjugation of women to men must be rated as one of the most fantastic myths ever created by the human mind. Gilda Ratcliff Men are nervous of remarkable women.

their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.

feminists who are anxious to force us to regard the sexes as completely equal in portion and worth.
Sigmund Freud

The good news is my objective is not to bend you over, fuck you hard and painful while pulling
your hair, listening with pleasure while you beg for more. The bad news is you don't believe me.
The reason for this is YOU, and all your sisters before you, since the day before day one, continuing 
throughout history until the present are the target of a vast, complicated brilliant conspiracy to
consistently(each and every moment) abuse,(verbally, mentally, and physically) rape, torture, and
kill you. This conspiracy is validated by all organized religion, government, corporations, customs,
rules, regulations and the 24/7 365 daily bombardment of all forms of advertising/marketing to be 
beautiful involving makeup, polished nails, sexy lingerie, and other adornments. It is on your mind
24/7 while you work, eat, sleep, and interact with other men and women.

There is a special place in hell for women who do not help other women. Madeline Albright. Women
should not be enlightened or educated. they should, in fact, be segregated as they are the cause of
hideous and involuntary erections in holy men. St. Augustine, Christian minister.Women are all 
female impersonators to some degree. Susan Brownmiller

I only seek a radical feminist, not a socialist or liberal feminist. Ninety seven percent of women do
not know the difference. I am attracted to unusual, different, outspoken, creative women who think outside the box. Men are intimidated by you, and your sisters see you as a threat, and have or will
sabotage you for their benefit. ""Normal women"" who desire a family, children, and financial security
almost always have not worked for me. Regarding intimacy, the chances of that happening are less
than slim and none. We would have to connect on a spiritual, emotionally, physical and intellectual
level. I do not have dreams of a serious relationship. Also, my experience with women concerning 
sex is they see it as a chore, and studies have shown that seventy percent would choose chocolate
or shopping if given a choice. A dinner, cultural event, and stimulating conversation would be ok
with me. If you do respond put radical feminist so I know you are not a robot.

I see the world as a beautiful journey to explore-not the scary place the news portray. I laugh out loud 
daily, smiling to myself often, and enjoy being in natures wonder. Sure, I have had my bad times
but I am content with the present moment. I am a realist about the good and the bad. I have learned to
stay optimistic and have become an unconventional, universal thinker. I believe that if you live your 
life to your best alignment with your soul's purpose you can do no wrong and don't wish to harm other living creatures, all people included.

I will not judge if you smoke, take recreational drugs, or drink alcohol, as no one is a clean slate,
an enlightened being, or a saint. Most people cannot listen, or understand other people, even in their
70's. They are too distracted, numbed out by the media, and only focus on their immediate day-to-day
survival and dependent responsibilities. In this technology and fast paced world, I have somehow
learned to slow down, tune in and open my eyes. My spirit is no longer sleeping, rather it is like a 
vibrant child always seeking adventure and beauty. I am an adult and have responsibilities, but
freedom and wonderment have not ceased to exist. Also, I am average looking, and Google Kevin Spacey or Robin Williams for a facial. I have been told there is a close resemblance.

I'm 63 years old and I'm looking for a gentleman to spend time with. He must be active and basically healthy. I like being at home but I like running the streets too. I like movies, museums, shows, live music, long walks, the ocean, coffee, and good conversation...and more.

I'm healthy, active, and I'm medium build, 5'9"".

I lean to the left politically, mostly. I'm somewhat environmentally conscious, (I'm mostly vegetarian/vegan but not always), and I'm not into organized religion, but I have spiritual interests.

I'm friendly, basically positive, open, and honest. I work to be a better person every day.

Time's-a-wastin', as they say. Let's hang out and have coffee.

I'm currently in LA looking to rent a room on a temporary or permanent basis because I want to move back here because this is where my friends and family are. I'm moving from Las Vegas.

See you soon?

This is strictly for free. I'm a pretty good photographer but want to use my camera more often for experience. You will have to host or in a reasonably close outdoor area.

I'll take candid shots or posed, fully clothed, boudoir or nude. Straight or kink (exceptions are animals, blood, scat or under age) I'm an older bi male, a bit kinky so am open to any kind of pictures you want or need. From straight face shots for portfolios to your own nudes or a bit kinky bi or hetro poses with a friend, wife or girlfriend.

You keep all pics except for any you allow me to add to my portfolio to show what I can do. I'm also very good with video if you have your own camera and need personal video. And I do have editing programs, both pictures and video.

I only have time afternoons or early evenings during the week and it must be at your place or reasonably close outdoor area.

IN YOUR FIRST EMAIL, tell me what type of photos you want, where you are located and if you have the time... ONLY afternoon or early evenings during he week. I don't mind spending a few hours shooting if needed.

Any hint of spam goes right into trash I don't want to waste my time or yours.

If you are the type of person who wants to play a game of checkers and say we can't because we don't have a board. Get out of here. That attitude is pee-pee. You should respond. Lets grab some rocks and etch a checkerboard into the ground and play. That is how it is done. lol

I am not necessarily looking to date. I want friends and if things go from there that is chill as well.

So if you are down to meet up, chill, and draw some chalk. Hit me up.
If you want to know who I am ask. I'll send you a link to everything you would need to know.


In Addition: 
- Sending a picture gets you brownie points and I will send one back. 
- It helps if you live close by. It is not an issue tho esp if you travel. lol
- Helps a lot if you are single and without children.
- I will not download any special communication apps or programs.

Hello, my name is Daisy. I have TMAU which is a condition that makes me smell bad, so I don't get out much. I am looking for friends to talk to throughout the day. Nothing sexual just conversation. I recently started making youtube videos & I created a few social media accounts so follow if you want or send a message me so we can talk. I don't have many friends or people to talk to besides my dogs, so it would be nice.

I'm new to LA and I love everything outdoors including zoos, museums, and national parks. I find them fascinating!

I'm seeking a friend who also enjoys going to the zoo to come with me to the San Diego Zoo and / or Safari Park (they are two different locations). I have a dual membership that allows me to bring one person for free to both places. I'd like to go sometime this week / weekend. It's best if you can drive. 

I'm educated, employed professional, non-smoker, non-drug user, funny, cute, charismatic, outgoing, and pretty awesome! :-)

When you respond, please let me know a bit about you, your hobbies, and a pic. Oh, and any questions you have. I look forward to exploring the Zoo with you!

You've got questions.

Serious questions.

SUPER serious questions.

""What happened to a sense of wonder?""

""How do I rectify the natural human urge to make the world a better place with the reality of ultimately meaningless natural human obsessions?""

""What do I do when I realize being a grown up kind of sucks?""

""Where does this ennui come from?""

""Why is ennui such a funny word? It sounds like what a toddler would call his penis, an in-wee""

""Oh shit. Please stop thinking about that. The private parts of toddlers is never something that should be thought about, unless you're a pediatric urologist ""

""Is pediatric urology a real field? Or are they just pediatricians or urologists?""

Yes, we all have questions. Just hopefully not about pediatric urology.

Recently I realized I want a career in law enforcement... :) Its so discouraging when I have friends or current co-workers ask about what I want in the future, I tell them that I'm working on getting into shape to go to the police academy and if I'm not getting a dirty look, I get a one word responses, or how much they hate this or hate that. I think it's pretty sad to see so many young people not even encouraging others who want to better a community they've been apart of their whole life, to make their world or maybe even their future kid's community a more safe place. Instead I get backlash.



I feel like I should just keep it a secret, but at the same time I'm so proud of myself for getting this far, getting over the intimidation of all the what ifs and working towards something so great. 



I guest I'm just looking for like minded people or a few words of encouragement, its always nice to read some supporting words while I'm working hard towards something so big.

Hello, I'm Jorj. I'm 23, 5'10, 165lb. Brown hair/eyes. Bottom. 
In a nut shell, I'm currently living in VA where I can't find work (in this little town I live in) I'm living with my family, and have no way of making a life for myself. I'm young guy not living life and am just existing from day to day.
I want to branch out and find a better life, find love, and a sense of identity. 
I'm looking to see if there are any generous top guys out there who would be willing to fly me out to LA and help me build a new life. I'm also looking for some kind of relationship, so I'm not gonna use you and loose you, if you get the metaphor.
I'm someone with a lot to offer and of course would be willing to pay you back once I'm back on my feet again.
Sometimes life is lonely and we need help from our fellow man to make changes in our lives, right? 

I would be more than grateful to anyone asking my ad who is willing to help a stranger and make a difference in my life.

About you, just be chill. Hopefully you like to have endless conversations on random subjects and like to laugh and like friendly banter. 

Sorry not 4/20 friendly, don't care if you do but I don't. But I dont mind hanging out with Ms Molly here and there ;)

Well I'm not sure how far I will get with this because for some people it's always about sex and not the actually nature of the ad. So here goes...what's up! I'm looking for a serious workout partner! I do work at a gym and I had some trainers but due to a little financial situation I had to stop, but I still need to hit the gym or just basically exercise on a regular...but it's hard to stay motivated on the real, so I was hoping if I had some one to workout with it would make it easier. I work 3rd shift so ideally someone that would be available in the afternoons or even early evenings or so would be great. If you have to do mornings that will be fine, I will just have to bring my workout clothes along with me. You don't have to be in the best shape of course but at least look as if though you've seen the inside of a gym or weights or something. I have a few workout plans and dvds but to have that push would be great as well. Anyway hit me up if you are interested and tell me your goals as well. If you have a group of friends that would like to join or that you work out with, that would be great since we can all motivate each other.

What's up! I'm looking for a serious workout partner. I do work at a gym and I had some trainers but due to a little financial situation I had to stop, but I still need to hit the gym or just basically exercise on a regular and I need to do it hard...but it's hard to stay motivated on the real, so I was hoping if I had some one to workout with it would make it easier. I do have T25, Insanity, Hip Hop abs etc and that's cool but I get bored easily and I want to lift some weights as well. Like I stated before I work for a gym. 24 hour fitness to be exact. I'm trying to lose 20 lbs or so and we can help support each other. I'm putting this into the strictly platonic section because my priority is to get a workout partner. I am not looking for sex or anything of that nature for real. It would help if you do have a membership at a 24 hour fitness and is somewhat fit or active/athletic.

I have been so distracted these last couple months dealing with life's issues that I have neglected my physical health and gained some weight. I am wanting to become discipline in this area again and I'm looking for a workout partner so we can motivate each other. The biggest factor will be time of the day that you like to workout, how often and where you're located in relation to my home. Please send me this information and I will respond accordingly.

Hello.

I am seeking either a Korean or Japanese girl to help me learn and practice either Korean or Japanese. I speak very little Japanese and No Korean. But I have always wanted to learn both languages and may be even meet a nice person.
I live in the South Bay, near the IKEA off the 405, so if you are local to me that would be great. I am a tall, fit Italian and White male in my late 30's, and I am not concerned with your age, just looking for someone who would like to teach me. And in exchange if you want my help learning or practicing English, that will be just fine.

Thank you for reading my post.

Hey I am a new photographer who recently got trained in photography. I want to get more practice in different kinds of photography and I am looking for a woman who is interested in getting all types of photos done. I would take 10 to 15 pictures of you and give you all the copies. I won't charge anything from you for the photos. It's completely free and I am doing this to get more practice and it's my hobby. 

My gears are Nikon D810 + 24-70mm f2.8 + 50mm f1.8 with flashlight kit.


please let me know if anybody interested?

so the honest truth to begin this ad with is that I am married. I am NOT unhappily married nor is my marriage in any way difficult. I'm just looking for something more. I guess you can say I want something exciting and the idea of an affair has always excited me. In the end I think it's in our human nature to always want more than what we have. Or in other words sometimes we are just selfish. 

I would enjoy having an affair with a woman who maybe finds herself in the same situation as I do or someone who just find the idea of being with a married man exciting. As far as age is concerned I would prefer someone between the ages of 20 thru 32. anyway hope to hear from you.

I'm 6'0, hispanic, avg build, and yeah... anything you want to know just ask :). Text me 3 two 3 4 three one 8 four six 4 ( I hate doing that but I guess CL has rules)

Hey strangers. I'm a bit drunk while writing this so I hope everything makes sense. Tequila ~~ anyway,
Lets write a song together; I'm a lyricist /drummer looking for people to create music with - this isn't code for something sexual. I know this might seem crazy, wild, adventurous but that's exactly what I'm tryna find. If that's you please reply :) I'm inspired by Halsey , Melanie Martinez , mansion by NF , wait by NF .. I'm the wallflower type with a mind full of ideas.

Does anyone have any experience with medical pelvic floor work or recommend a therapist?

I am a straight male not looking for a sensual or sexual experience, just was recommended this therapy by my doc.

Typical college student here hoping to find a cute girl to become kissing friends with. I know it sounds a little contradictory but I think it could work. You would ideally be a great kisser and drama-free. I don't do drugs or smoke anything... Age is not as important as maturity is. I can't host, but willing to meet anywhere chill where we can makeout. 

I am hoping to find a friend so we can build a relationship with and hopefully meet sometime soon. Let's trade pics and see if we click :)
